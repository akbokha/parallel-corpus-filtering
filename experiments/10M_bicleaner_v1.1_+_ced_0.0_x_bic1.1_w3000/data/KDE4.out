the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by simply available .
for more information on using &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose the extensions , select the card @-@ card tools and select the desired modules here .
this is a list of standard configuration modules from the K@@ DE package ; Ad@@ d@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package de@@ base , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; click on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of stor@@ my , if present , delete .
the module description ( also called folder filters ) you can reach in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current directory on different kind filters .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M which is currently displayed . as the default , the display starts with the root notes of document , example : document@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol@@ ism and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the partic@@ ul@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of clearly showing folder hier@@ archi@@ es with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . every object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the size of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflected the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries can be specified , even if they are easily detected in the folder hier@@ archy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ representation a rect@@ angle , that represents a file or a file in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on color mode , can be either depth for light detection of the depth depth or the image of any other file association such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various features of the file or folder . for each property , you can specify if enough space is displayed , only if there is enough space available to display any restrictions on the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . moreover , you can define the relative position of labelling in rect@@ angle .
for example algorith@@ mic algorith@@ ms should be observed that the surface is proportional to size the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target will not always be kept . it will be drawn up in order to be lost in order to get the sub@@ ordin@@ ate income . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
as divi@@ ding the area of a entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation remains to be left . here , it is important for labelling and avo@@ idance of space loss by frames always favourable to the areas that are square . the best methods of this matter are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive division healing .
you can set the minimal representation area for an entry on the menu entry . instead , an aut@@ é@@ ed pattern in the area of the or@@ derly details will be drawn to indicate that this area is actually covered by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was originally designed as small testing application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ get designed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you call the picture gallery , a dialogue with which you can set the image of the gallery .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ came ; albums of course . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ came ; working together .
&amp; digi@@ came ; contains fast imaging with basic education tools . you can use this to review your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . the handling skills can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ came ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills to use . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion with li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC colour management efficiency .
improved database with significantly more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; K@@ DE ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ came ; an open source project . that means it is based on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ al ; try to make sense of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you use these lin@@ king menu , your web browser doesn &apos;t open a page in error coverage . all required information are already listed here . please follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ came ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , users and developers are helping each other . if you are a regular user from &amp; digi@@ came ; ask yourself any questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ came ; however , you may soon talk about other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to visit news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ came ; to experience .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ came ; to participate in the developer Mail@@ ing list . guide to report in the developer Mail@@ ing list of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
if you &amp; digi@@ came ; for the first time , you will ask where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote file . enter the folder symbol for folder to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . this path is stored for all image files .
later you can add as many folders such as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ came ; will also use the digi@@ plug library in addition to the digi@@ plug library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the images added as basic folder . &amp; digi@@ came ; viewed every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the passage of the folder you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ came ; dur@@ o recur@@ sively recur@@ sively the li@@ br@@ arian trail in its whole depth . you can &apos;t exclu@@ de sub@@ folder , unless there &apos;s i@@ ste in hidden folder . you can do extra@@ di@@ bs &amp; digi@@ came ; do it by using a point before the name of the folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ds have no photos as symbols . you can change the albums by clicking on the folder symbol . this is then used as an album symbol . further details can be found in section albums .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ tization ; your digital camera setup . after that you should learn how to use my albums and my keyword to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ ei@@ support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so &amp; digi@@ came ; perhaps support is based on the li@@ bra@@ f library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help resource support .
how to set up and work with the raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h @-@ Work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ came ; albums of course . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ came ; working together .
modern digital cameras are based on the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera will be implemented as a record @-@ run . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communication with digital cameras , which has been developed and supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images of digital cameras for computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are large files and transfers about the serial port are slowly , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports this cameras and leads the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found in this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be compiled with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so the EX@@ IF support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to read the thum@@ b@@ nails . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may possibly do the thum@@ b@@ nails for nothing or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I module : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a joint Mod@@ ul@@ structure for &amp; digi@@ came ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide modules for all graphics programs . the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to add &amp; digi@@ came ; by writing a small module to complement a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Swit@@ ches + F .
moving and put off pictures everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , via the horizontal separ@@ at@@ line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be found in keywords , file list or searching .
- a file selection allows you to offset the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , Movies , and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the fil@@ let on the file name only appears when this ind the symbol view is displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of Al@@ ben@@ Settings .
the view &amp; quot ; my Al@@ ben@@ li@@ bri@@ quot ; exhibits an organized view on your photo albums . these albums can be stored in a single alb@@ um@@ tree , in which they were stored on the hard disk , in which the album was created first , sorted by the album first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
in case you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Imp@@ oral Pictures . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . select album Imp@@ oral Photo .
to copy a picture from an album to another album and move it , you can select the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there . in the then released menu you &apos;ll have to select whether the image is moving or copying or copy them . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the Alb@@ um@@ Properties give you information about this collection . to access the Alb@@ um@@ Properties , you have to select the right button on the album and edit night@@ club features .
Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections by collection . if you want to add new collections or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - date : is used if you sort of records after date with view records After date sort .
the buttons oldest , average , latest : this set the date on the date of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . it &apos;s first tries to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ came ; first picture will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; my Al@@ ben@@ li@@ bri@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos on the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; as Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ en@@ quot ; select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album may always be contained in a collection and collections can not be screw@@ ed up .
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports the input of words for individual photos in the field of my rec@@ umbent list below . album collections have another effect . for the collection , you can use both photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the photo window will feature you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album will display in the photo window . every photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this look with the two lu@@ pin buttons in the tool bar .
if you open a record the first time you need to wait for short while the thum@@ b@@ nails are generated . this you can avoid when you re@@ generate ex@@ cre@@ denti@@ als in the menu ex@@ tras All
information on any picture are displayed below the associated preview . which information is , you can change about settings digi@@ came ; setup here the albums page and adjust the range of thum@@ b@@ nails for your wishes .
the thum@@ b@@ nails have a b@@ aller , the releases . if you have to rest the mouse poin@@ ter at a moment over a picture . the help shows the main features including any photos of a photo . the screen picture above in the main window shows such a relief window .
photos are all there is at &amp; digi@@ came ; goes . albums and Tags allow you to organize your pictures , and allows you to reach a number of improvements to these . you can reach all the features , the preview or the menu picture in the menu bar . you can choose the choice between viewing the pictures , a di@@ as@@ au or the processing of images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by clicking either F4 Image Edit ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit your photos . in the section digi@@ vers ; image editing you can view your photos and modify your photos and modify them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ came ; the functionality that you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the Con@@ text menu with the right mouse button , and how to adapt it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; K@@ DE ; manual .
you should consider that it can come after editing through other educational programs to problems with the image @-@ containing met@@ ad@@ ata . some programs save this data not starting when you save the modified image . this makes this information lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ came ; introduces two options to turn the speed . the easiest way to click on the preview and select fil@@ ming . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can click the right button to preview and F2 ren@@ aming off the context menu . note that you have the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo of &amp; digi@@ came ; er@@ ase , it will be moved in the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; K@@ DE ; post@@ pon@@ ed . F@@ 8 thum@@ b or ent@@ f if you prefer to be really del@@ eting , you can use this by using Shift ; de@@ f .
the view &amp; quot ; my Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos on the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; used either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select one month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet , so you can only select the photos of the selected days .
photos with photos provided a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cat@@ alog@@ ed . Tags are sti@@ ckers , individual photos or entire groups can be assigned . once a keyword is assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again .
when a keyword is selected , all photos that were selected by this keyword is indicated .
Tags can be sorted into a hier@@ arch@@ ical tree . you can also log your keywords log@@ ically . you can also fold the parts of the Bau@@ ms &amp; quot ; My C@@ wor@@ d@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; so you can find the keywords that you are looking for , easy to find .
the Tags are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JPEG , saved . you can also use your keywords in other programs , as soon as digi@@ tization ; the pictures noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; my keyword quot ; or click on an existing keyword . if you have a new keyword , after you click on an existing keyword , this keyword will be found to the keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button . if you delete a keyword , the photo is not deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a sample by moving it to the desired position in the tree , and then create a menu that gives you the opportunity to shift the keyword . a keyword can only be a tree only once in a tree .
you can change the properties of a sample by clicking with the right mouse button and select in the context menu keyword . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; my keyword quot ; change .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the image with the right mouse button and select the text menu as an album preview . in addition , you can move the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
around &amp; digi@@ came ; s functionality to deal with words , you must first choose your photos with words . this can be picked up on the appropriate keyword on the tree &amp; quot ; my keyword quot ; drag and place there . alternatively , you can also select the right button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword .
you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords in it . on this type , you can choose a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event that it was made , etc .
once you have a photo with keyword , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you will open the context menu of the photos and select from the keywords menu . the menu indicates you only the keywords assigned to the photo .
the time beam view shows a time dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per unit . a select frame can be post@@ pon@@ ed over this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you &apos;ll just click on the bottom right of the box frame which displays the time unit . this allows all the associated pictures displayed in the main window .
in the bottom of the field you can input a title and store your selection . then , it appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp , and in the future more .
fog he search@@ box is a small lamp the green if the search is found . if you click here , the filtering process will be deleted and all pictures appear again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you can find a simple search box like those described above . but you can find this search here as live search that has always been fil@@ ming what you have been saved as search criteria .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the results will be used in my search list . if you want to change your search for your search list , you just need to select the corresponding entry from my search list and select an option in his context menu .
if you &apos;re looking for search , the form appears to be search again with the previously called search information . in case you can choose the extended search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the Advanced search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ came ; S database are looking for .
the list of search rules is used to reset the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ able bank . all rules will be added and deleted by operators . every option can be er@@ ased with other via the logical operations all ... , A ... , No ... or at least ... or at least ... Find out . furthermore , you can create search of the Type &amp; quot ; AND N@@ ICH@@ T@@ quot ;
&amp; digi@@ al ; character@@ izes each picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare these signatures . the smaller the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a section in which you can cause any picture to find a similar . if you can slide a picture of somewhere on the symbol of un@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it out there .
sk@@ etch : free sk@@ etch color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and digi@@ plug ; finds the appropriate pictures . also , a swelling can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature program . you can move with the mouse wheel in or out zo@@ oming or post@@ p@@ . move it while you &apos;ll be filtered and displayed . all pictures within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this course puts all of your pictures on Ge@@ o data .
in the bottom of the field you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . he works like a live Geo@@ ord@@ ner .
&amp; digi@@ came ; establishes a ligh@@ test in a separate window with which you can simply compare images . he works with all supported image formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L the ligh@@ thouses are added to the console and open its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ came ; main window are , you can open the ligh@@ test quickly with L Extras table .
from the front bar you can compare the pictures you want to see in the left or right section of the window and put there . a small arrow will display you to what copy in which window frames can be carried out . if you will be a preview of the tool , then you will compare it to the same image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to select from a series of images . then , the two first pictures will automatically be downloaded from the tool@@ bar , to display it in the left @-@ hand side . the right adjacent image will be displayed in the right side . this is simplified by a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal holes are also working directly from the fiber , e.g. F4 file ...
all image information from the right side@@ bar side of the main sequence are available for both cre@@ denti@@ als in the light . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure measurements .
in the lower end of each division , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you need to swi@@ vel at the cross section . in order to rotate the visible area of the image , you &apos;ll need to preview both pictures below the same image .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom controls under the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in the picture and out . this happens in both pictures if you are looking ahead in mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion fore@@ word ? digital inventory management looks every part of the process after the image has been taken up to final edition and permanent storage . each of the photos captured , sc@@ anned or digital photographs sets a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips as you can back up , find , protect and use photos . we look at the procedures for digital photographs that can be downloaded , backup , assess , retri@@ eval , archive , optimize , waiting , and export the image files .
&amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , secu@@ res , seeking , conver@@ ging and exported content that have a mon@@ et@@ ric or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition , provide information about or a documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you &apos;ll need to find longer a specific photo . if you don &apos;t know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t want to save &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to store the met@@ ad@@ ata for both in a database and secure archi@@ ving that you can access with other programs , platforms , and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know you need to do something in your system . your image files should somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide if you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to change some time on a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found fast over your location . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % of the files will be and you will not want to organise your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simplified a backup strategy and migration . they will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the option met@@ ad@@ ata to store in the installation page of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ al ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? that &apos;s how you want to change ? that &apos;s a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attribute . these are of course the most important .
now the real labour starts , as you should now choose to each photo . of course , you can choose all images that require the same attribute and then place the value . you will start best with the evaluation or order . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos on the best photos .
let &apos;s leave us with keyword , key words , as you continue on other programs , or proceed categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import Cat@@ alog@@ ised pictures from a different source with embedded rec@@ tile , then &amp; digi@@ came ; automatically create the tree for you to build on the pictures in the right place . changing the hier@@ archy inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by doing a sub@@ bau@@ ms on another . the changed keyword will be done by &amp; digi@@ came ; updated while the sub@@ trees are pursued .
the graphics shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is cut off . this is a very rough representation since each block consists of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all pictures .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ise your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to let most don &apos;t let your photos just see , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you that the landing place of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y , 60 years after the landing is present , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . the lab@@ eling has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others viewing your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create a interest . remember , the key is it the meaning to the viewer , to help Him to help you about the motive that you are moving about what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it only has the strength only with a lab@@ eling for yourself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ came ; you can also save a lot of text , in an internation@@ alized alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even export him for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE allows you to exp@@ ose it to your wishes in the labelling and / or the title of the Web @-@ gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story for opening hours a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train de@@ parts the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities offered by ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already ir@@ reversible and will be able to re@@ end up with the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also view your travel virtually via pictures with ge@@ ographic data . this shows the pictures also to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; can export with the goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and describes the practice to remove copyright limitations regarding the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information comes in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( author of writer and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photograph . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may be used . according to that value , it should not be changed . this field does not support Kom@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
car title ( author for the author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the identification number of photographers . examples of this field can be titles , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ ging for the author , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the visual field to identify who offers the photo . this must not necessarily be the author . if the photographer is a news agency , such as Reuters , Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here , then the group / agency will provide the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work can be extingu@@ ished , er@@ ase or modify . the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ al ; is available in the near future a module for stap@@ le processing .
topics : record errors , record failure , blackout , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ bid , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the road or fire . this type of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section , there is problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest database production company , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss .
to fight for the problem with CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ tious images must be treated more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ v@@ quality . of course , you can also claim CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording sessions . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you &apos;re writing a lot of reliable . therefore , it turns the right to select .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to error , even if you were just writing . therefore , they use a control sum@@ ming mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control environments . despite this massive protective device it requires chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , it &apos;s a favorable program called I@@ so@@ b@@ ster that works miracles among CDs and Linux ; but there is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data of damaged flo@@ ppy disks , hard drives , flash media , USB running drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to save the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything related to CDs and DVDs was also applicable to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device for high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . also , you should check the media with a description , date &amp; author &apos;s license and then on a clean , dark dry and protected animals protected place . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of hardware or software that can read this media .
flo@@ ats make your statistics for itself . your manufacturer &apos;s guaranteed include a new disk , but not the data . Google introduces a large field study on error mechanisms of hard drives at your disposal : dis@@ closure study
shortly : dis@@ cos can be operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature control , error rate increases dramatically . some of SM@@ ART fail@@ ures are the most frequent failure . these are especially Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing counter . the expected lifetime exposure is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to excess voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power out@@ flow before you secured the files , but these losses are normally made without any major problems .
while most electric devices aren &apos;t much power , it looks different with devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed spro@@ uts . they can cause serious damage , complete data loss , hardware age , destroyed Mo@@ ther@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against electricity points is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed by electricity . it is usually available in form of a plug @-@ up bar . do not think any plugs also contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for a over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also consider that it offers protection against lighten@@ ing protection , and thus protects the connected equipment .
because a over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should consider that all periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage and can also provide a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for on the way .
while over@@ voltage protection , your system protects your system from small fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of un@@ predic@@ tive data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a rup@@ tible free power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically operate cordless energy , if a power out@@ age occurs . some models allow them to be able to store up the system again . if you purchase a UPS , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements such as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time is the battery and the underlying software is interesting .
don &apos;t forget the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be paid for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you think about it . at the end you should always remember all the cables before you ride to the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are in comparison to the hard drives at home , however , very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . additionally , you have to send data on the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . this is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services to photos stored on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB . the professional version will not be available to you , in the case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you will get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality only .
from the perspective of data security , web @-@ solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted for securing and large companies with the large companies , so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safe in the offer .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system and b@@ tr@@ fs require at least the data integrity between your operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection against it . no one seems to have it in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable grid parts are another source of transmission rates , as they produce interventions within the data flow . in normal fil@@ esystem , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle with turn@@ outs on low level and is highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available at a GP@@ L compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ ine file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that uses z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . for not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most to think . it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the exam@@ ining process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses is the greatest threat to digital data : in@@ correct , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that the technology continues to develop a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality look , the optimum range of 6 @-@ meg@@ apixel cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full size sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk can now be responsible for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , make no one another &apos;s loss of data loss . thus , your data is often affected by a data loss . thus ass@@ ure your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make something dangerous as the re @-@ installation of your operating system to make records of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster proposes locally and destroys a lot . don &apos;t forget aircraft strikes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern one whole space or the whole house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ ak is always a not local store . bring your f@@ uses the stairs up , into the neighbouring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a more common reason for a loss of data loss despite ensuring the panic . if you have a backup , you cannot save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential : a backup of the files have been changed since the last actu@@ ation process . this creates a complete moment of time to two points : the complete security and the last differential .
in@@ creative Sec@@ uring : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . this provides several snap@@ shots . you can re@@ produce the original status at any time . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it was only un@@ touched and not continually .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool which allows you to set up easily on your machine . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file @-@ trans@@ mitting file r@@ sync only the difference of files actually changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh .
backup important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach allows you enough time to explore losses and again . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a moment for each month . every other di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , retained X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ...
in order to survive the next 40 years , it is about the time span that you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table with caution about what today is said with caution and re@@ assess the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask ones@@ elf if the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered with explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ uses technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . remain open to open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialized print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means , in fact , enlarge .
let &apos;s assume that you have plans the scal@@ ability and have the area you want to zoom on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and lay it on a new record :
verify the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but do not hang them .
&amp; disk ; dd if = / dev / SD@@ B &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ ER ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS and dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read , then you can create that self . this task will be easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard , but it can be much more . it is loss free , support X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG may need gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ authentic@@ ity data for improved colour recognition at het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous platforms . however , the dis@@ advantage is that there is relative number of administration information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a low @-@ loss compression bal@@ m ( Def@@ end ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted to many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative File format is a licensed @-@ free and open resource format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is required for use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturers D@@ NG is now available and we hope to use the Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why to replace the XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . it is a description of XML and R@@ DF . it is stored on the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer it to be archi@@ ved , mostly in the rough format , mostly in the resource format . however , it may come up to problems at the link between the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file , and how it can be noted above . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organisation that supports a wide range of applications and business models . the D@@ CM@@ I communities and D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fying efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import@@ ing images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera image , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your primary archi@@ v . this function is not implemented yet .
for a subtle editing you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ came ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut from other programs under certain circumstances .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ coding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ came ; in the section add a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can already have your hard disk . the camera interface provides you but many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ able bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this with the machine , turn the camera on the display mode and turn them . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if the connection is done , a Fer@@ tig -@@ indicator will appear at the lower end and the thum@@ b@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display a preview for file association settings , photos , movies , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to download the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a entry and met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialogue shows file features and the photo information stored internally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata , such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . this information is the same as with the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ al ; or image editing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available at some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then you can download the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ came ; . at the download the photos are not deleted , we will be able to check if the pictures are safe in an album before removing the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the default selection of &amp; K@@ DE . as soon as you select the photos , use the button to download and then select the chosen settings . the button to download is considered as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , it is possible to download a new option . these pictures have now not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ came ; in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in front window . if you select this option , you will only download the new pictures .
if you &apos;re using the buttons you can download or downloading a dialog box , you will appear in which the photos are stored in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums can be sorted in section My Albums , then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after having chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete them all at once , by selecting the button delete all . if you only want to delete a few , you must select this first and delete delete your chosen ones .
please note that there is no possibility that you have deleted from the camera , they will be completely deleted . you should be carefully insp@@ ected if the photos are successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , you should do this about the camera level as this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names . this can result in double file names , if you have photos of various Record@@ ings in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the picture was made to integrate into the file name .
in the next section , you will find Op@@ tions for turning and mirrors of the image and date @-@ based signatures . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically .
the options While the transfer will open three more options , which will be performed before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information is copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different file format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn off the option &amp; time . for further adap@@ tations , you should read the help of command str@@ ing@@ time .
if you use the Camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you will have the opportunity to change file names in lower@@ case , or if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ came ; for a photo used , is below the name displayed by the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be stored and automatically used if you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ came ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the tim@@ eline recording . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver these information , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic turn , use the button and select the automatic turn in the bottom range of the window .
if your camera has information about the date , where the photo was made , it can use &amp; digi@@ came ; this signatures can be downloaded on image data . all pictures with the same date will be uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras will be available in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photographs .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos right on the target album . if you want to change this option , you &apos;ll need to expand this option . use the button @-@ based sub@@ al@@ bs at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their computer on your camera is the button Download . then select upload . the file representation dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; appears where you can select the files uploaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ came ; you , where the images should be loaded up . a folder list dialog for the camera will appear . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographer it can be interesting to link an image with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graph@@ ate an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability to use .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can easily open a browser which can use the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to en@@ rich the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 has many GPS data fields , such as the direction , saddle and map refer@@ r@@ ents . there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the correct hardware , via a post @-@ machining of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about manual entry of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera integrated with a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , these data must be stored in the GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the module for ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS running the data of images and from the GPS can extract and cor@@ relate . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ text hair@@ y coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , all of the navigation details for Europe .

select support can be installed on embedded view or image editing . put the standard behaviour of &amp; digi@@ al ; firm , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the respective IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected by downloading the camera interface . also , in a database synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
car title is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should contain the number of photographers such as advertis@@ er photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author , this must also be filled .

the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the relevant IP@@ TC @-@ Fel@@ der@@ . this means that the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ came ; this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available in other programs and can be imported without getting lost .
store images as embedded on images ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG image : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you have read to your photos , with the images embedded in images . attention : for images that have already been written , these are over@@ written by the digi@@ tization ; over@@ written .
the page settings contains all options for information that appear if the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window will rest on a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; to indicate , you can add the file extension of this list and remove any file in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; alb@@ um@@ folder , which has none of these extensions ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire &amp; digi@@ came ; can be installed on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can receive better results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch them here . you can turn the tool bar when you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and sub@@ ordin@@ ated areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image editing , this approach can be set up with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that images are encoded in higher resolution of lumin@@ ance as the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the next declaration .
using P@@ NG com@@ pressing , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG needs a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . thus , 1 : a low and 9 represents a high compression .
the T@@ IF@@ F files can be compressed using the T@@ IF@@ F files . this reduces the size of T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm has no loss .
with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can store without any loss of loss . even if you have the loss of loss of loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ came , image editing is only a picture viewer for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool to mani@@ pulation your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of image editing .
the default account is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light when using this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option records the picture a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 gr@@ ate pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance will use the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white is not set off . standard is it a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white card taken in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors have the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps more details in the sh@@ rou@@ ters . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your pictures are burned as to capture through the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the sh@@ lich@@ ter in various ros@@ at@@ es . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the spot@@ lights .
this is possible because blue pixels generally cannot be fed up as quickly as green and red . &amp; digi@@ cra@@ w are therefore trying to recon@@ struct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a matter how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the opportunity to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three com@@ promises and can therefore be adapted for each picture separately .
set the lumin@@ ance value for your taste . you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ al ; image processing is made small . in order to keep the time for Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from the partial @-@ filtered image sensor that provides many cameras and that is a Matrix colored pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; digi@@ al ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it was created , but it creates color files on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color soft@@ ening of your lenti@@ ls you can set the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a soft@@ ening correction , as you are carried out during the resource conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions such as these are given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ came ; information such as the color space from a colour space to the other , so the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior of questions when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
color profile file S@@ ing here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ came ; exam@@ ines this folder then during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to rear . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color vision view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colour@@ fully managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturers and model which you use . not all profiles are based on the same kind . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color mapping or g@@ amm@@ ak@@ or@@ tive . currently , d@@ cra@@ w gamma does not have to convert from 16 @-@ bit depth . this means that you must perform the ton@@ ic mapping itself .
there are other options like the soft @-@ pro@@ of @-@ profile , with which you can em@@ ulate as your printer might be given a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors , so you could manually correct , instead of leaving the blind algorithm your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious what colour profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . obviously , this answer is un@@ official :
Canon profile extension makes the style of the goal : F for a precise style , L for Land@@ scapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; image viewer and image work is supported . many modules have been written to collabor@@ ate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I module , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that are then taken from &amp; digi@@ came ; then , these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the pre@@ text menu .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu of short commands .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find via the K@@ IP@@ I project using htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of di@@ as@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper controller adjust the time between frame inputs , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other cross@@ roads turn the met@@ ad@@ ata or out that are termin@@ ated at the lower end of the pictures during the display .
camera properties show a list of all the cameras on the left . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is connected to a camera which is connected to the computer . currently , you are connected to the camera settings . currently , here are serial port , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the lower end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / m , please indicate your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , put them in the display mode and turn on .
try out if &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the Camera menu .
you can select any user name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can enter all here .
with the option of viewing dialog for the shift of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can you can display the call of &amp; digi@@ al ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album . in the sections of a photo and delete a record you will find more details .
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar allows to keep silent through &amp; digi@@ came ; applied when you use the changes in the right side@@ bar without any refund . otherwise , you need to apply the changes with button modifications .
you can also take the ad of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ came ; at boot , it acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
the setting of the start to new photos are forced &amp; digi@@ came ; the base folder was deleted after new or deleted albums / photos . if something was deleted from the base file , it asks &amp; digi@@ came ; you , if it is to delete it from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ came ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can select at@@ titudes design from the tool bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ came ; to create , find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ came ; contains fast imaging with some base tools . you can use them to view and correction your photos and improve . image editing may be launched by clicking on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selection of entry ads .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; so they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I module you will find in section picture editing .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ity , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar on the upper edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
editing features change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo , before you have used the original photo . please note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have stored the picture .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save them with Save As .
as long as you have not stored the photo , you can restore the original image to restore from the menu file or restore the button Rest@@ oring the image editing in tool bar . you then lose every change that you have carried out on the photo since the last store .
virtually any action of image editing may be back or re @-@ produced . the last action you can reverse , by selecting editing or restore , or select Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make use of the keyboard , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for the reverse and c@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you &apos;re using the &amp; L@@ MB ; click on the tool@@ bar or restore button in the tool bar a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all promotions will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation links in the tool bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu . if you have any changes on the current photo , you will ask if you want to save them .
you can start in the photo and out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . it is usually displayed in the normal view , where you don &apos;t want to change the tool dialog . if you don &apos;t want this , you can view this from the &amp; digi@@ came ; main window . see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image below and get the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here , before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . complete picture pages can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export assist@@ ants . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; main window frames on the right edge , which is available important information and promotions for selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation sp@@ rop@@ es , also available in image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multi@@ fold button on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the edge .
in the labelling view , you can input labelling with unlimited size or paste . note that the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . it means that all special characters are allowed to use EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields to allow you to be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC prot@@ ector in other applications , you should consider this restrictions .
after which you comments , please use either the button users or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
in addition to the applic@@ ator button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . but this is always done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the section rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting line . it can always be applied to a single mouse click on the side@@ bar or using the keyboard bar C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select this and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the tip view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword @-@ tree and a select box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ al ; -@@ session stopped .
the keyword tree is adapted dynam@@ ically with the search phrase . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is another relief for the input of sampling in a series of images . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for fast access .
keywords are also possible by markings of the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all Tags of the image are stored in the field of the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main view , select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword in the keyword .
the side@@ bar stit@@ ch filter is used to change the selection of the displayed pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar will be used with their album , data , sample and search requests . if additionally one or more sample filter from the right side is used , only the cutting quantity of these two will be displayed . all keywords are available .
you can also check and put off . in the main view , you have chosen multiple images to choose from . if the keyword is already exists , you can easily put it from the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . as a result , a dialog can be asked whether you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the keyword filter is set on no keywords , which was chosen by C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right @-@ word @-@ tree was taken on the selection and dis@@ car@@ ded . a dialog is asked whether this keyword is to be set .
these search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off on settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be a or be , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which database is searched for . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can define an extended search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the check@@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :

this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mostly adapted to &amp; digi@@ came ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you have set up a color@@ fully @-@ administered work@@ flow , you can reach a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from your camera or scanner . with a colour@@ fully @-@ administered work@@ flow you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners , and the colors that you print or in the web you comply with your digital dark chamber .
if the topic comes on color administration , everybody wants to know which kno@@ bs must press for the results he wants . unfortunately , the sense of this Tut@@ orials is to provide you adequate decisions on each point of image processing work@@ flows . additionally , you will enable you to make your own informed decisions to make your own informed decisions .
if your image work@@ flows must be met all six below criteria , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB @-@ color space . ( see further information below )
their only other image issues are by e @-@ mail or the Web , where the RGB of the de facto standard is standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and do the life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color space to make thoughts about color vulnerable ng ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ bs @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB space space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger farms , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms top@@ ente side and then click Info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cover my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB space space ?
yes ! whether you do not work in the s@@ RGB space space or not , you must work your monitor . if you operate your monitor on s@@ RGB , then you need to use your monitor on the RGB mode , then you need to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automated correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting to try further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , equ@@ alize , automatic and contrast to the menu automatically correc@@ ting automatic correction automatically try to make your colors the best . they will experiment with these effects , to see what seems best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method is scal@@ able via the entire picture , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test item is as light as possible without changing its color sha@@ ding . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for pictures of dark or balanced .
dis@@ like : this method adjusted the amp@@ lif@@ iers of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intoler@@ ance is the same number of pixels . sometimes this result is only garbage . it is a very powerful operation which causes either wonders in a picture or destroyed it .
automatic cut : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . you determines the dark and light @-@ border sha@@ des and adjusted the red , green and blue channels on the entire history range .
contrast wi@@ den : this method improves the contrast and the illumin@@ ance of the RGB values of a picture through the post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the Weiß@@ er von &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to carry the white equal to a photos .
the white @-@ equ@@ is@@ cation is slightly restricted to color space over a colour space containing 8 @-@ bit color . if you are able to do so far from the original plate , areas with over@@ exposure appears . if you are working in the white mode , which can be done in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options are better due to correction .
this tool is based on a white equ@@ ating element that is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . it &apos;s starting the menu entry in white @-@ like white image processing .
the front window can be adjusted in size . on the left side are adapted both the original pattern as well as the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original whi@@ stle , then you can click on the original window .
the preview of the target group features a red Marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of Pix@@ els under this mar@@ ker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right up , a hist@@ ogram is displayed as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful there , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the sha@@ ding details of your photos or down .
with the above @-@ mentioned checks , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then anywhere on the picture preview for the color temperature of the white color . this type is also set automatically the temperature and green values automatically .
additionally , you can set the Weiß@@ er directly with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed indicator increases the colors , if more than a colour channel of pixels is over@@ exposed . you will be the combined result in the Weiß@@ er@@ equ@@ ate . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and store do exactly this . any setting of the White comparison you have set to store in a text file and load again later .
the button pre@@ ferences sets all the filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white @-@ comparison list . note that neutral settings will be a different picture as your original . when you store this , your original pattern will be changed .
you can adjust the code depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the far common JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . this coding also requires more record pitch , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of paint profiles . color mapping can be carried out through the sub@@ window for using paint profiles . detailed instructions for use of paint profiles can draw the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in menu using sound value correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously . this is useful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction . in the manual to the sound value correction you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool color effects provide four colour effects , a bicycle effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter available .
in times of chemical processing , solar steri@@ lization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ an , a effect of the delicate phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ron of the additional light . this also had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas were dar@@ ker and colours by the second lighting inver@@ ted . this tool was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at about 50 % intensity the image shows what is possible . another increase is finally a negative image that is not done on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original pattern is the ( 1 ) and the processed intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid @-@ filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from one satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , he emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a slightly turned colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those that weigh hardly any landscapes , too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding re@@ petitions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ é . in large images , the filter can trigger the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not unusual you want to correct the colour concent@@ rates and the illumin@@ ance of photos . you can try to experiment with the options in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you can get a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem . even in this case , the tool is necessary to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of raising them . all changes you can perform in preview . if you like this result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound value correction for improving exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you will need to clari@@ fy the range of application for this tool . concrete , the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph@@ s of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel , or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders can be cli@@ cked into the cli@@ cks and that can be moved to change the intensity of the image . the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the control is shifting the regulator and make sure how the image changes .
on the right hand you can see the original and preview of the image . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : using this selection box can be set , whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the logical scale division is useful .
three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for middle tones often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image , to automatically adjust the input of the shadows , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to evaluate the output value as well . compression of output values can be used , for example , to create a very easy picture as background , while something else can be seen in the background .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
save as and shop : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be stored and later re@@ loaded again . it will use Gim@@ p levels format .
if you use this mode and re @-@ use the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input will automatically be adjusted to all shadows , means and sun@@ de@@ parts . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ supply indicator indicator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome .
below , you can see an example for the alignment of the input data applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target image displayed . the preview will be dynamic depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modification channel : this select box allows you to specify the channel which is changed from the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols are found to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , linear mode generates a wide beams . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a short trip to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can view that these bright tones can correspon@@ d@@ led with dar@@ ker pr@@ un@@ es and corresponding to the corresponding image pixel .
on the preview of the original photos is a red markings visible . if you want to change this mar@@ ker on the area you want to change the original value , create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and shop : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every turn you can create this file system can be uploaded and later . file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you are using this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ aces buttons automatically create control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , means and solar panels . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original sign for the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ exposed indi@@ ces indicator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome .
below , you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ channel . shadow and sun@@ ba@@ the was applied using the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and the revised ( 2 ) .
the canal mixer of &amp; digi@@ al ; image editing is a tool to improve color channels , or change the color sha@@ des of photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colour tones of images . you can edit it from the menu Color @-@ Mixer mixer .
selecting the box office you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed as opposed to your rider .
the preview of the target image has a red Marker . if you positioned this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the appropriate color value .
the controls for the module are on the right below : controls for red , green and construction will allow you to activate the corresponding color components . this is particularly convenient if you can also check the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you can also reduce the corresponding color components . this is particularly convenient if you can reduce the color scheme to generate great black @-@ and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white Por@@ traits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour is exposed to a visible smoke , which occur in the same place in the colour channel and whose noise pattern in each channel is different . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first .
storing as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any arbitr@@ ary setting can be stored for later and then upload . the used file format is the g@@ im@@ p @-@ mixer format .
the option over@@ supply indicator indicator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was rec@@ adjusted . option L@@ umin@@ anz will be activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating due to your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step , as color pictures can be converted simply on the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ er@@ profiles .

with the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool texture may apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your picture whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can look like a painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry picture texture of the image processing can be used for it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one of this parameter to the right increases the amount of depth or three @-@ dimensional texture in the image .
a paper texture is applied on the picture below . the original pattern is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) . parameters relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set up a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ ak eye . under the frame , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter , you turn the desired frame type for your picture . through the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce ren@@ ds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , cut off with a nice three dimensional frame of the ideal place for a bone effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with pattern .
width : gives the width of frame in percent . the range of value for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert a single @-@ format text into a picture at any place . this also works at several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with its features like you need . the larger the image , the larger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
every attitude that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool template , you can apply a template on a picture .
the menu picture templates . use templates in the image processing can be used to lay templates about a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add using maximum com@@ pressing ( 9 ) to simpli@@ fy your template &apos;s file size ; please send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ came ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for first time , you &apos;ll need to set your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have the template files . these settings are marked for the next start .
after the root can@@ opy was placed for the sten@@ cils , a building management , which reflects the folder structure of templates . selecting a folder , the selection of sten@@ cil will be updated automatically .
under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the enlargement factor and position your image .
enlarge : this kno@@ b enlar@@ ges the image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inking : this button shr@@ inks the underlying picture . it will be cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the picture below the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your image . the image will be adapted automatically .
digi@@ tization ; presents three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple , created but , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
uncertainty mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture . indeed , it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s been a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Winst@@ on Chang .
Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ sic is probably the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus and most digit@@ alised pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the resolution will be combined with only minim@@ alist differences . the same phenomenon can be seen if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally require more subsequent sharp@@ ening than normal cameras for the home user .
JPEG image frequently have been applied to a camera internal sharp@@ ening . images in the rough size must always be har@@ med during processing .
some scanners apply a sharp@@ ening device already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by choosing a photo with sharp@@ ening ver@@ ke@@ . you can correct your application with the menu application .
you should her@@ eby be careful because the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening raises the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the useful technology can be used to correct a picture . in general , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution , the picture a little soft to draw , is much easier to use . use the tool to sof@@ ten and experim@@ enting something with settings . the front window on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter is fu@@ zzy mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help edit the picture . the display window shows the output of the fil@@ let with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . default values are often good results and should be tried out . if you make the shar@@ per mask to be strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ats will produce in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore adjust pictures at best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wis@@ ely image added to the original . this makes the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB @-@ value and to apply differential amount . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ alties is excluded , and therefore beauty errors in the faces , cel@@ esti@@ cks and water surface areas .
this is an example of un@@ sharp mask filters . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied using radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ingly re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the ur@@ ging legal dischar@@ ging filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool attempts a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing quot ; in which it uses def@@ ati@@ zation . it uses a technology called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is the use of a uncertainty mask . you can start it from the menu by calling colors Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ability in the image processing .
in practice , the circular cl@@ amping is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ail@@ le@@ ur has a very long tail , which is far from the original qu@@ ins pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ail@@ le@@ ur is influenced in most cases , which causes un@@ wanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the main parameter for use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher level when your image is very un@@ sharp , then you should pay attention to Heiligen@@ pons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ultimate effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in space filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will still keep the image still further .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your in@@ def@@ ici@@ fe filter is caused . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you have a value to zero , you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ size : this value determines size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
storing as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ loc@@ ating parameters which you have set will be stored for later and then can be loaded .
try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations change the changes are not immediately visible , but then left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read images and cover pictures , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by using un@@ sharp mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically it has to create un@@ sharp mas@@ king and always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the need@@ les . practical , the result of the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters always can be at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small inter@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ sharp colour image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is attributable to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods for sharp@@ ening , digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator is set up the sharp@@ ness of the range of the area in order to generate a more natural pup@@ il .
color ink allows a customized colour for pupils . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tools in order to remove non @-@ specific art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ ferences as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the default settings are listed below :
in case you want to adjust the filter settings required , you can use the riders access and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of details . a small value leads to a smooth smoo@@ thing about the picture . a value of 0,9 should be so aware that no sharp@@ ening should be required afterwards . please note that the details always should be ordered .
unit dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value of smoo@@ ther equally in all directions , while a value close to 1 is only in one direction . if you create a film grain or CCD noise will create a high value of wave similar patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts will be best in the vicinity of 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum bulb factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value matching the sound of noise in your image .
rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is difficult if it &apos;s difficult to produce the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it is necessary to be set higher than 3 .
repeat : there are often 1 or 2 algorithm to go through . usually this is usually 1 or 2 .
el@@ ong@@ ings long da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen , it should be also small . make sure that small angles generate a long term . therefore , you should choose this value acceptable for your needs .
integral step wide &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step in pixels . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : this option is only small . it doubles the run@@ time . but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it .
the buttons save as and store do exactly this . any setting of image errors can now be stored in a text file , and then again be loaded again .
picture errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and move a high CPU load . so you can therefore break the calculation anytime with the kno@@ b .
below you can see such image errors with small arti@@ facts . the module is made on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a pec@@ uli@@ ar black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad film setting during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce images . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts , i.e. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ing noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ aly ; -@@ Effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on digital cameras , so you can read this in English in this tut@@ orial .
the image picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ c@@ ey noise that can be removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced settings can remain at the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel and can move the picture above the picture and the colour in it is smoo@@ ther and thus smaller faul@@ ts .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ening of sharp@@ ness . if it is increased , noise drops will be reset . if it is increased , noise may be reset . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filters picture details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubri@@ cation occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the film . if it is too strong , the whole noise can occur or noise may occur . put it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either paint or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either paint or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
gamma : controls the gam@@ em@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dar@@ ker areas , typically more strongly inf@@ lic@@ ited , however he adds up the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines the edges of smoo@@ ther , if it is increased to high . if it is increased to its minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may occur on the edges . he can remove noise and is the recommended method .
store under and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for smokers that have set you can be stored in the file system and then be loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected output has been used with standard settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution , the picture a little soft to draw , is fortunately much easier to use a picture . use the tool to sof@@ ten and experim@@ enting with the gl@@ alog@@ ical button on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undes@@ i@@ red arti@@ facts , film gra@@ zing , scrat@@ ches , com@@ pressive or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alised images . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the image con@@ tours and receives the content as well as the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tures . the texture is done with another tool , the image error correction , performed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ s and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts Re@@ duce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of compression &amp; quot ; it creates some compression &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this attitude shall correct these problems .
buttons Save as and store do exactly this . every attitude of photo rest@@ oring can be stored in a text file , and then again be loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . so you can therefore break the calculation anytime with the button .
below , you can reduce like a photo with balance @-@ shaped noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded using a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ cks on the faces . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ cks on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and correct under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been taken on an old colour photo , which has been taken with a scanner - the scanning arti@@ facts can be seen from the scanning lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel from photos that were with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ lop .
bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly high in high quality raw mode photos , because many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ zard button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to explore the dark picture directly in the connection to explore new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct picture . notice that the wi@@ zard will notice the last dark pixels and again automatically re@@ load this in the next session .
the image area and the preview can help you correct within the picture . the movie window shows the output of the fil@@ thy with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pre@@ sides .
select an area around the faulty pixel on the preview and the results of the movie . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ section : there is an average of neighbor pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels have a distance of 1 from pixel block to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixel .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixel with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn , to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel .
Ku@@ bisch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures , applied . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is seen below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. , under@@ exposed corners , a picture .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often reduce the overall sensor field not evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sha@@ dy ) it can reduce the corners and edges of the image , by reducing the light that can be achieved there under certain circumstances .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 with the bladder that it is impossible to keep the camera with hand . far angle lens should also be used , even with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise uncertainty effects through movement arise .
with the large exposure of digital cameras and film scanners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by simul@@ ating a equivalent transformation at a picture which is made without these filters . algorithm is protected by a Cent@@ er@@ filter . algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light @-@ amp@@ lif@@ iers at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or randomly compens@@ ate the density around a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ starch , Con@@ trast and Gamma -@@ Settings : editing a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to adjust exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers provide you only positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a more subtle re@@ adjustment of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation out of the &amp; digi@@ al ; image processing of the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a lamp and contra@@ sting correction was also carried out with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ al ; lens distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion . colour distor@@ tion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree handles the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or kon@@ v@@ exe form of the picture .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but laughs at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the co @-@ efficient gra@@ der correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distor@@ tion second degree . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distor@@ tion can be corrected and positive values .
corner : this value controls the strength of distor@@ tion fourth degree . this value increases more strongly to the edges than in the center of the picture . for most lenti@@ ls the &apos; corners &apos; has the reverse pre@@ fix of the parameter General .
zoom : this value is sc@@ aled the image size and leads to a correction first gra@@ ft through . negative values increase during positive the picture .
bright : this value adjusted the brightness of the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners while positive values them increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustr@@ ating the dialogue with a preview of distor@@ tion correction . the values that you use for your image will be saved and used as standard values .
the tons and ho@@ ver@@ aging correction should be carried out before all add@@ ressing or size changes . best result , if you cut a picture new and then carry out a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would seem apparent .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal auxili@@ ary line . move it to an important place , such as the ocean side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . in connection , you can correct the m@@ ash / cus@@ hion distor@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a ver@@ ging distor@@ tion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or zoom on the zoom controls .
for most pictures , the ton@@ al @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as photos of the front , frame and paintings is the perspective to correct all the angles at the picture 90 degrees . please note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of a tons @-@ shaped correction for a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that can be found under this URL . filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 iso .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you shift the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can see the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters for film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the gra@@ zing texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter color channels are mixing the re@@ produce of infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color formations are missing .
this is an example of the infrared film based on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original pattern is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the top .
the &amp; digi@@ al ; filter film extraction is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ zing on your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer has great sil@@ ver@@ ware of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere detached from daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ ni@@ ches look specially to your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values need to use on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more grains , you may apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ grain effect on a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that processed the ( 2 ) . it used film sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil paintings . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper one cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brushes are better for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smooth or , viewed from the other side , the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processed size is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . therefore , images of their gra@@ dients are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen for you to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two regul@@ ators with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator choose the pin size and the bottom adjusted the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the coal label filter . the original pattern ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adju@@ sting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ al ; Filter engraving your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing about the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a grey , month landscape .
depth allows to set the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ tion effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and looks like whether it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wavel@@ ength 1 , the image is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by in@@ correct effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : get the picture through stern@@ most lines run by a centre . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ pen of a zo@@ oming camera , thereby creating a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al in@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the picture by turning the pixels around a centre . this simul@@ ates the in@@ correct one of a rotating camera .
distance need@@ les : do the image capture the effect of a non @-@ focused camera system . the object seems to re@@ sign in the background .
movement need@@ less : distor@@ ted the picture through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the in@@ consisten@@ cies of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photography , camera .
soft inscription : get the image soft@@ ly in dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or add a warm and subtle light .
shi@@ mmer@@ ing : distor@@ ted the picture by acci@@ dental displacement of pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ consisten@@ cies of a arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent Dis@@ uses : finds the p@@ add@@ ling pool in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo into rectangular cells and then created it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation anytime with the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your picture . this makes it natural your pictures a great appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ ging legally protected algorithm .
trop@@ hy size allows to change the size of the drops . since the trop@@ hy size does not grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . Fisch@@ au@@ gen change the optical effect of the drops on the image .
you can handle with the &amp; digi@@ al ; image editing is required free of shelves . use the range -@@ tool to pick up the range , e.g. a face , which should remain free . if you then start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the drop film Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset from a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through sp@@ ies or rotating into the right orientation . the tools you can find in the menu transformer and make mirrors .
photo @-@ blowing is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo , at a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture of up or guess the details ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here is a good work . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it on the desired size with the size size . select transformation size change in the menu , and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool to size change is using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase a picture . &amp; digi@@ tised ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
4 aspect ratio maintain : when this setting is enabled , the new size aspect ratio may retain the aspect ratio of the original image .
rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is difficult if it is difficult to produce the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it is necessary to be set higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and store are used exactly . every single deposit for photo enlarge can be stored as text file , and later be loaded again .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and move a high CPU load . you can break the calculation anytime with the button .
you can see an example of a picture of the picture shows a small colour image increased to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlar@@ gers .
the cut of a photo is not only a performed surgery , but also an frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . image editing will just create a picture with the mouse , pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle , generate . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move your mouse .
if you release the mouse button again the area of photos is cut out . by this way , you can change a good overview of your photo after the cutting area . you can drag the size of a cutting area by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle , you simply create with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the section , use the button &quot; button button in the tool bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or file Save to store the newly created photo .
in the storage area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you &apos;ve defined in the dialog remains .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high size , the size of the height and cross @-@ format size is assigned .
the tool is used to aspect ratio aspect ratio . this means it is always equal to use any other physical size , regardless of whether you see cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue , two buttons exist about the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
down in the dialog you can set the Max . ratio button to cut the range for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation , place .
the tool After aspect ratio allows you to use the settings depending on image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are stored for the cutting tool , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the support for help allow assistance to enable you to watch your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party , harmon@@ ic triangles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle towards a harmon@@ ious triangles .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als of a sunflower . it appears in all kinds of things that we look as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you include your pictures , buildings and even photos , to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is deri@@ ded by the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number is according to the sum of their two ahead . the resulting part is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition this usually follows as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden middle represents liquid aid lines if you are an image . these help are listed below :
golden spiral becomes your goal to get good results for your photos . compared to third party organ , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition runs along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river .
another rule is called the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye can be at the heart of the composition . it can be a line or different objects . this can be simply because of being without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the golden triangles also deri@@ ves from the above @-@ discussed gold spiral . in contrast to the harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ alled triangles . diagonal to these lines can place a static object of more dynamic .
if you are using golden triangles to break your frame , you create a effect of professional photographer dynamic sy@@ mm@@ etry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you cannot reach .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mir@@ ro@@ red can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the lines can be invisible . on this type you can adjust the color of the lines to your actual picture .
the free rotation is a tool to turn an image to any angle .
if you are making a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera horizont@@ ally or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are shot at an angle . you can fix it with the &amp; digi@@ tised ; image editing and the tool free rotation . select Free Press and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ p@@ angle . the values on this sli@@ p@@ case are specified in degrees . you can set the switch back to 0 degrees . a preview of the shooting is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right side .
to your help , the Internet module provides an horizontal and vertical line . do you move to position the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview for the two lines . now adjust it to an important point of the image . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot an image , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair this is the function transformer cut from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cut . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing sm@@ ooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ical transform@@ ations are carried out around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialogue , you will find some information which will help you view the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new picture , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new picture , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the top : displays the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees to the bottom edge of the transformed area .
corner to the right : shows the current angle in degrees to the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adju@@ sting the perspective the image becomes a bit sc@@ rub@@ ber@@ ized . for a single custom@@ ization , this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after passing the perspective , you get un@@ joy@@ ful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to transfer this is the picture with transformation cut from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite side . this is no rotation , the image is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module via transform@@ ers .
switch your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can press horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press on pre@@ ferences , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed right from the front area .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the button tool to adjust the lines to adjust your image .
after having carried out the switch , the picture will be a bit wi@@ ped out . for a single rotation , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sw@@ ings calcul@@ ates twice as much stress and therefore you should avoid this .
after the calibration , the image has imp@@ ly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the image with transformation cut from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way such as these libraries have been comp@@ ili@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . but they will always JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F will be found .
&amp; digi@@ came ; shows only files in formats which knows . this happens on the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions ; you can change this list of file extensions ; you can find further information in the configuration configuration .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to use this file format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found on Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save losses when indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the resource format , so you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find Roh@@ format pictures in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ came . in the configuration , you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ came ; .

&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in science , especially in science , especially in science . the programs that include graph@@ s and X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic surface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ channels are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ s ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( making a change of Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; Graph@@ ene Graph@@ ene and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; to open or to open graph@@ s in &amp; graph@@ s ; in one &amp; Kate ; component to open
load big graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from around 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
other required software : &amp; graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph , are needed in detail :
the main window displays the open graph@@ s , each in its own window . at first , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , the main window is empty as in the lower screen . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the icon file open and the ( empty ) list re@@ opened files . click on the first icon to view the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files are selected , the main window looks like in the lower screenshot :
as you can see , an overview of the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum distor@@ tion of a graph .
if the file just changed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; loaded file from another program is displayed , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded , or if you want to ignore the change , so that your decision may change , so you can change your decision later , you can set up the menu settings k@@ graph@@ viewer ; set up ... see also .
if you open a graphite file outside of a running &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ In@@ stance , &amp; eg ; in file @-@ browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , want to open or want to exhibit graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but these can also be retro@@ fitted with the setup dialog .
during program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last meeting again . again , you can save your choice both , and later .
you can also define how the graph should be split by several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you are using several sites , you can choose if the parts of the graph will be placed on this site . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph .
front page with one on several sites distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site once again offers the possibility to determine the behavior if a file on the hard disk is changed , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or program the program each time .
the page will open the possibility to determine the behaviour of &amp; graph@@ s ; determine if a graph will be opened outside of a running session . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window ) or determine that each time is re@@ asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the seat of the seat management gives the possibility to specify the grid behavior of &amp; graph@@ s ; you can set up a standard behavior ( the files of the last meeting or not ) or specify , or specify at any start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context menu , usually at a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n window , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorith@@ ms . the entries as they are described on the web site of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or hist@@ ochem@@ ical represent@@ ations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm p@@ ushes the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce a short edges and a few edge over@@ l@@ apping .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ int model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm uses , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical in@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s a spr@@ int model layout . it uses the Fru@@ it @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istik , and includes a multi @-@ gra@@ dient for the treatment of large and clusters .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm orders the knots circular at the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lical structures .
opens a dialog box in which you can specify a layout command , which can then be carried out by a shell . the command should give graph@@ s to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify special options , or graph@@ s the graph@@ s with a filter before being drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or un@@ done ) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ s ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images read images are available to read new images and add them .
this module can be used to read and en@@ rich new images added by external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
images scan : using the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which supports the s@@ ane project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . so this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane .
if you scan the menu entry picture will open a dialog box , which you can choose between all available sources on your machine . choose the source of you want to get the image . you can also place the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace the default values of duc@@ ees to select your image accordingly . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower right corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual , you will find further information .
make sure the window is completely displayed , because some settings otherwise may not be displayed .
after having pushed the button , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target file . please note that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore create very large files . you will also select the folder &amp; # 160 file , or create a file that is stored .
screen photos can be selected after you have chosen in the menu icon &gt; screen photo ... a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window below the mouse .
if all of your own program window is chosen , the manifest@@ ing program will disappear so you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read about a short delay to read the current visible work space . if you read the complete Desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen photo will be waiting before it starts . if you need to switch on other working areas you should select this delay high enough to navigate there .
after the image has been made , the dialog options of the target image with the above @-@ described options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates into the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture , and the geographical data will be stored in the EX@@ IF definition of the image and loc@@ alization may be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization , tools are available to locate images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and latitude of latitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man may download and convert data from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface may merge a number of selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ sigh@@ ted dialog appears . to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , this file contains , of course , data that have been recorded at the same sites as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation that shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera will need to be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
the maximum period devi@@ ation for the maximum period of time is an upper vari@@ ance for GPS @-@ time and camera sovereignty . the devi@@ ation is to be merged . the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one place to edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and Differ@@ ence in min can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location between camera and GPS lies , you can place this boundaries here and then cor@@ relate the button .
the coordinates can be manually set up with this dialogue . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next notice , you just need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found with the shown map and to be set . in addition , select the relevant region and increase si@@ e.@@ add this to the appropriate accuracy . the card must always be manually selected . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here &apos;s a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . character set is encoded with UTF @-@ 8 to enable a possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to HTML . you need these albums only . the albums will not choose from hier@@ arch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly choose a large number of albums on the right side . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ ce and the text will appear in the head of the HTML page .
the tab visual appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explained . if you then click on a picture a new page will be displayed in the image . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider record defines the settings and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder from which you have writing permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you select the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information is also stored in the new pictures .
with other colour depth you can change the standard colors depth . naturally , the file size does , of course , change the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the hor@@ semen profile allows you to watch some of the settings from the album tab for the thum@@ b@@ nails , these are small pictures displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user as far as the action is . press the break down to break the process .
if the module generates the pages it will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program reports to determine if mistakes appear during production . the web browser is automatically launched at the end to display the preview of the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to look at images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like fil@@ ming , zo@@ oming or shift . the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons . it was developed for a quick display and quick access to its functions .
after starting a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss module is a tool to change pictures without inter@@ fere with your quality .
this module allows to store images in JPEG format for the below , without the usual losses on quality or met@@ ad@@ ata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing since there is no com@@ pressing of the color @-@ formations . for example , one can be found at the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera system currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ ad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org lists of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import@@ ing function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy the data from one image to another . then , then , you can copy the import function , so the image will be able to copy the file representation . the data will be copied after you have pressed the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look at ex@@ i@@ v2 to see what formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in form of di@@ as@@ au .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ers can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ gio and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual pictures you can add a basic image transfer . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of di@@ as@@ au .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the di@@ as@@ au . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the media , you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can launch the module via ex@@ tras m@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected from you can then be listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . if you are planning the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds which will display a picture . the speed of the image output is defined below . a lower value produced very sudden , a great contrast , very smooth image changes .
the background colour may be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set under the name of the m@@ peg @-@ output file .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , this is integrated into the film . depending on your computer , you can start with the button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a coffee or enjoy a coffee when you are back again .
if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , so you can adapt the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ ra and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right below .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard phot@@ og@@ ot@@ le . this is also useful with image processing Gim@@ p . this is for example : useful to print them or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import / edit your stored images in one of three formats , JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is not expected that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first , choose the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . you can see the effect on your current settings to the image .
you can now adjust the values new to optimize conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the Weiß@@ er . essential parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amp@@ lif@@ iers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can proceed the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and the file name remains unchanged and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a low @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or later , you should not choose the JPEG format , as it requires only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , you can use it .
the st@@ acking mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode as you are sure , for example , using a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the opportunity to over@@ write the file automatically . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to compressed all images in an album . it uses the program card from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amp should be used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the product under the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image , or enlarge . there are four types of image change available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image will be selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to the screen size .
no proportional representation change in two dimensions . aspect ratio is altered at this option .
print preparation : prepar@@ es the picture for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of phot@@ op@@ en@@ iers . the target image , including background size , boundary size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of sending images previously . further images can draw on the list of sending images and place there .
after having started the module , the images window will be displayed with you selected images . add the button images , you can add more images to the selected image . for the last selected image will be displayed a preview on the right side .
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and add it to the list of sending images .
with the button images , select the selected pictures from the list of sending images .
after you have selected all images , you can open the new message with the new message of your e @-@ mail clients . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . they have to be attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending e @-@ mails . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change settings for sending images . their configuration is stored and used every time again until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify in the input field , including the correct path for your installation .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after adding comments in a hung file , the comments will be added to images into a text file and added the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best to use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the image file format .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically be closed , the status is automatically closed , looking for errors , and their e @-@ mail program will be automatically launched at the end . with the button Cl@@ ose you can swal@@ low this window ? en .
after starting the module &apos;s advanced di@@ as@@ au , a window with questions such as you want to have shown . you can choose between the selected and all the pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL transi@@ tions in the presentation uses very elegant image transfer using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the di@@ as@@ au will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures in the left corner during the presentation is displayed .
the loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can manually start with Es@@ c .
the option images randomly select that images are displayed in a random order . so it will not be used in order to see images in the album .
delay between the pictures can be set to the tim@@ ely distance between each images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test this before you show the presentation your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects between which you can choose . randomly select another effect from each transition between pictures .
during the slide you can access a tool bar on the upper left screen . move the mouse in this corner to switch you .
with this tool bar you can start presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the di@@ as@@ au .
on the left side of the screen , you can view the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the user surface .
this module sets the current selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ men@@ ü@@ s , as a background for your K@@ DE @-@ working surface .
as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , you are now in each group , so in persons , places and in group keywords are present .
in the browser window you can see the categories you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look at the EX@@ IF @-@ based information , look at the folder structure on your hard drive and , of course , look for them .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both persons can be seen . through this selection method , you can limit the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand pictures to a few individual images .
if you have chosen all the people , places and other settings you can see with thum@@ b@@ nails to view the pictures of your action area .
in the picture each person has the same icon in front of its name . they can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a separate text , that is , of course , also defined for places , keywords and other categories that you have defined . see the picture .
to display pictures next to the name , select the button , which is located right on the tool@@ bar . in the current context menu , you can choose which you can view the list for each category . it has the advantage that you can show symbols with images of persons and simultaneously a list of sample liter@@ al ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you need to define the image for every single person . to do this , you &apos;ll need to edit the image file window in the image . here you can adjust the image for the corresponding person . in the menu window you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and thus select what part of the image is to be shown or cut off .
if you can find the entry in the main window , you will find a dialog displayed by the dialog for the Fest@@ ing Image properties . this dialog can view you on the image once more .
if you enter a string in the field labelling or description , you can also enter a date or descriptions of the pictures following this text . if you want , you can also be a date for example ; the date can be either part of the total date , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window you can search all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but prefer to try the following functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and check out the fast @-@ up , screen photos and introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog ; and select the menu for the first time , or select the menu for the menu entry on@@ photo@@ album ; then a few example pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a connected HTML @-@ document to download .
at the lower edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this glue you can see here : . as the name suggests , this glue shows you data st@@ ats over images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each glue shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bodies only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the timer can inter@@ act on the following ways : you can change the displayed message view from the database ( if you select a date , you will see the first picture of this date in preview page ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures if you navigate in the preview section .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and the mouse over the lens of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ eline is displayed . if you select one area , you will be able to break down images of this period . you can break the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it offers two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures ; the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module is available ; integrated version , which you can create via the HTML menu ... click .
before HTML pages have to be created , you need to make some settings . these are split into the three areas of content , layout and goal . in the following , each area will be accurately described .
first , enter the title of the bli@@ g@@ cks and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo @-@ photo album ; HTML sample pages , see an example of these settings .
next , choose from whether a &amp; photo album may be created ; export file is to be seen on the viewing page . some information about export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed on the HTML pages . for example , that all pictures of a party are obvious . for example , note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . you can &apos;t use this attitude to hide certain images in particular amount .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most import@@ ing possibilities are clear why not received so special in this area .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust various resolutions on the pictures . this allows those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600 , no images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution any time you have defined . so he can run your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , as well . if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting range , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best chose for all your HTML files a base folder , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you have to select the main folder in which all your pictures will be stored . this folder will be saved and select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is visible to the viewer . if you have been created for the base folder a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL you should be here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files are not yet in final destination , you will need to manually copy them manually . in order to specify the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of files . this is not the sub @-@ file of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the only described configuration options described have all three on base folder or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder created , whose name you define in output folder .
if you are looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to apply a HTML page to view the images . if you have already booked a lot of time for viewing the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not be done once more .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can import a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import other data in your database . image characteristics are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in that , whether the images are stored in the file , or whether it &apos;s only a link to images . the advantage may have all the images into the file , and that file may be so independent , but the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a double way . first , the images are not found , so the images of the URL , which you have specified in the creation of HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via HTML export .
in the following , dialogue for exp@@ orting images is described , which you can export about the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it should act in internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three options available :
to manually copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Automati@@ cally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; copy to the .@@ k@@ im file and copy the pictures automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it normally is not worthwhile to com@@ press the files . if you like this , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is lim@@ iting maximum image size . if you send your friends images , the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large , for example , you can say that each image is to be 800 pixel wide and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu icon ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to imp@@ air@@ ment consists of four steps . first you need to select what pictures you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import images should be copied .
it can be that you person@@ alised the number of persons with the import file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialogue window , which should be imported in the third dialogue window , and what are the categories that are imported in your database .
in the fourth step , you can purchase the categories of import file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the image .
it must be simple to browse images and look at : if you look at images , you want to see images often within different image groups and md@@ ash ; if you want to see images from your Italy vacation and see a picture with your boy@@ friend , you may want to see all pictures where this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) fixed information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the search and look to through ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustments .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today your videos is taking care of . in many places in this manual , images are spoken about images , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all his information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can back with a program of your choice , e.g. nor@@ mals backup tools , copy on a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your pictures are stored and automatically re @-@ use this when you want to read another database with pictures , so you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
set up on the menu input settings ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user book , you will be explained to the various setup possibilities .
to the left you will see six different symbols , with which you can call setting options for viewing and the options for the viewer . for each setting , you can find an exhaus@@ tive assistance to the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described in you how to create various properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like items , animals or albums .
in view , you can see the dialogue that is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog box you can set full member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of a centre @-@ gli@@ mp@@ ing .
in view , you can select the installation possibilities that you want to select the list of members . with the above select list you can select the category you can configure . in the left window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this module is split with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin interface . some information can be found on the box of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called on the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call via the modules .
since the modules are used together among each other together , it can be used to test the modules with &amp; col@@ on album ; therefore , you should use new modules first with the demo @-@ database , before you call this on your own pictures ; Demo database &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; col@@ on album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications .
the greatest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order to albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
thereby simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview .
besides the current album , &amp; on @-@ photo album has to be handed over ; the modules also has a list of albums . here &amp; on @-@ photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; on photo album ; S browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all the people , then every entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be used as a category for virtual albums in this category . for example , if you are using the category persons , it will be done &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do if you have chosen people to view this and continue the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove these from the list of modules . start the settings dialog , and select the modules that are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen , as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you have used it from any other K@@ DE application , you can see above a menu and a tool bar . in the section we will see no information about your pictures . in the section we will see at this window , but now click here to show you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes on the picture where the picture was taken on , where the picture has been taken either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if , for example , on all the pictures of Jes@@ per , and all pictures have been recorded in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see this notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in , you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use it again if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the moving images inside the list : if you are depicted for example a family party and over all the 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are depicted , so you can find that the used names are moved up , which can be found faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to get a alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the icon for sorting under the list .
if you have selected any comments on each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and have these pictures with notes . just click on the front and back buttons that are located below the picture of the picture on the right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu option more multi @-@ added entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to indicate that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Comment , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new type or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also submit an entry to a category of sub@@ category . attention , this assumes that you are just alphabe@@ tically sorted out your categories .
you can shift the individual elements of the dialog box by setting the glue which form the upper edge of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make a window with your own window by drag him out of the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , you click on the button options ... which allows you to save the current construction and appearance of the window .
you can also make a frame entirely off . if you want to get this window again later , use the button options ... and then you can enter a / out window . this process can be seen in the image .
if you select the entry pictures in your browser , you will receive an overview with pres@@ cient images , or all the images if you do not have filters . for example , you can configure the size of thum@@ b@@ nails , by simply down to@@ es the mouse with the middle shelf , configure . try it easy .
if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this image will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete and press either the remove button or select in menu Edit menu . now you will show the window that you can see in the image .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for this problem , you can also use a solution . you can also use pictures stored on the hard disk . of course , you have to take pictures somewhere in the database . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk .
images which are cut to the right corner are not stored on the hard drive . however , this is available for pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , this pictures can display the preview of these pictures . however , you cannot see these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see this feature , you will need to copy files from the folders and copy them again . so , it &apos;s not supported until now you want to avoid the inser@@ ts of the question . if you want to avoid trouble , like the flow of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images .
in menu images , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you &apos;ll find the pictures so that you can see for others un@@ appro@@ ach@@ able , you can also watch all pictures you can see your little sister , increasing , and select the menu entry everything except for current view .
with this , you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of your little sister , simply lock the menu entry , so select all the images that you have locked away . if you want to get the images right , click on lock .
it is also possible to establish a password which must be entered into the images . to establish this password , simply select password change in the menu .
please note that this picture protection is not very secure . for one you can read all pictures on the hard drive and to the other one can read the password as un@@ encrypted text , only those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to defend the view of private pictures .
the reason why you want to review all your pictures with &amp; photo albums ; of course and hours over hours to review you , of course , you want to see them sometime . from this reason &amp; photo gallery has a picture _ and video viewer . this is a preview of how you can start .
the viewer can see you in . it shows naturally the image , but additional all the information you have about the picture , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily configure which information is displayed and if all these options are displayed in the viewer . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . all these options are available below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this view . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures from Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen people from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images to the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the keys picture high and image down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded on the viewer , you can run these as di@@ as@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then you can download a new picture after a few seconds . as frequently it can press a new picture , you can start the C@@ tr@@ l keys and plus or minus the slide through the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability to the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen @-@ mode and back .
if you can use the viewer in the picture , you can easily pull out the image into the image . with the Min@@ us key you can draw out again a rect@@ angle The Plus button zo@@ omed in the center of the picture shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oma .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed . with the equation setting the zo@@ oms so each pixel is equivalent to a pixel screen pixel screen .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work at videos that are in and out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ u@@ sta@@ ste .
with the fil@@ ming features from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes about the actual picture with the menu entry from the context menu .
if you can look at images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set on the picture . in the moment you can view the break and configuration dialog at the picture to mark this name . but you may prefer to mark the image and look at another pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and watch them as good or bad , while you &apos;re looking for one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to watch pictures with features while looking at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letter . in view , you can see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the pictures you can edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the front view , then you can add features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the characteristic , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . this case allows you to paint &amp; photo album ; on the picture .
the brick is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the type you can reverse your wei@@ rd later .
in a picture you can see a picture on the painting . to switch the painting of &amp; photo album ; click on the picture paint from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; do not have to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully controlling , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood .
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object shown in the wire @-@ mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all the objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position when you want to add the object and select either the icon in the tool bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following entry @-@ down menu will end , so you can choose the correct position :
using delete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply this changes . if you have invali@@ d values , you can report an error message with an error message . then , you can reset the input command or dis@@ card the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
if you work on a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of your own resources .
press on a preview of the self @-@ economic view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default , if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ate element , you can only cross a part of the texture ( e.g. a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture @-@ map ) , cross it locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will appear a small cross in the wire model view . this cross is marked the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the displacement by pulling the mouse within the entire window .
each object has an open stage model . you can only indicate that value relative to the above @-@ level object or absolute value . objects are only then displayed if they are selected or their visibility stage are smaller or equal to the tool &apos;s chosen visible level .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window allocation as default . the object @-@ tree and view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window allocation or if you need a different arrangement , you can add it any number . you can also store multiple windows orders , and simply switch between different arrangements .
to ro@@ ve a window over or below a view , you &apos;ll pull the facade to the top or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates then the new position .
to create a new column , please draw the en@@ code to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views over each other , you &apos;ll pull the thum@@ b in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card @-@ card into the views .
the last possible window allocation are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anchor , drag the attachment to the Desktop or click on the road to the left .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the area bar . to prevent this , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can control them at any place .
the current window view you can store with view window mapping ... store . there will be a dialog displayed in which you can store the shut@@ ters under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be correct . as this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool bar or select the menu view scene .
a R@@ ender mode is equivalent to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it defines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full images .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender @-@ box in the tool@@ bar or in the menu view mode , select the following dialog :
any R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that lets you recognize the properties of mode .
in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , choose the cross section and give the image cut to ren@@ dering into input fields .
in combination box quality , you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a picture is lowered with only one beam , different bugs can arise . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stud @-@ effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . generally , pictures with this feature is better .
if you enter anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ uted and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super sampling . standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is split up again and adap@@ tive because each pixel is split up and adap@@ tive to the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam of pixels . if you adjust the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels , both pixels are calculated by the persecution of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points is calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue . the difference is then :
Di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values the fore@@ seen threshold , then the pixels in 4 sub@@ pixel will be checked , and the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you deposit J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a long time to calculate the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map card , you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated radi@@ ators have no object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; still not the complete command @-@ catch of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support code text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code to the text file in the editor , select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your Editor you can also include source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also include .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called upon , if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ dering . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . please click here the path to your document re@@ ten@@ tion and version . supported by versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example , al@@ titudes to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files that are not in the scene , you must also enter the path to these files . if a file is specified in different ways of the library , the first file is used .
the color for the wire @-@ models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the colour for control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected inspection points .
the color of the rect@@ angle in the camera view and in the window type mark .
you can adjust the object of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wireless model views . you can adjust the grid for shifts , sc@@ outs , and rot@@ ations .
larger values provide a more accurate wire model and therefore a better ins@@ em@@ ulation for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the details of detail for two directions separately .
if you cross fine @-@ detail faith@@ fulness for extended projections , all wireless projections are used . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections . this feature makes a better approach to projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross wall , a wall is framed behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box pattern from two adjustable colours .
when you cross soil , a floor gets below the objects . the floor is displayed in a box pattern from two adjustable colours .
if you cross edge control , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering of scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . accurate information about parameters you can find in the R@@ ender modes .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window pan@@ eling is explained how you can create and store window orders .
the combination field standard window allocation : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window allocation in the start of the program .
the list of pre @-@ hand shut@@ ters indicates all existing window orders . a new arrangement can add you to the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
any window allocation is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window frames . new views can add the button to add and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with them , you &apos;ll get a card view along with the previous view and sli@@ t view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start with more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you are able to create all steps in this manual , you should use the ultimate but easy scene with beginners : a ball on a plane .
but you should consider following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain that you can only use a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider this important rules :
if you don &apos;t adjust camera , no rules can be applied for ren@@ dering , as a result you will get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t add light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you &apos;ll get only a black picture .
if you have everything faul@@ t@@ less , you see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window allocation should :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bars . please read the documentation , so you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first select all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu input . so you have a scene without objects .
the wireless model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you generate . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . this shows you the results of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new record with the name camera . if they click on it , you will see the contents of the object characteristics , where the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation , please find more details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for instructions , but notice that the camera can change in view control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on the left button and drag him to the desired place .
if you press the button user or the input , the wireless model views and the object tree immediately change these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the scene for the scene . you could adjust for example a Qu@@ ader ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a permanent method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually , offers a simpler opportunity . you can use an infinite level as floor :
a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button user or the input design . in the object tree , the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire model view also shows the plane , although at the moment only as limited maximum level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane will expand to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree , you &apos;ll notice that you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you can see the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , turning and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should post@@ p@@ one the floor to exercise a unit below the Horizont@@ al line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose displacement and adjust the values as follows :
first choose the floor to set its material characteristics . there are many different materials , but select something unique in the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue with which you can select as the object should be inserted . please choose the first object . you can change the name in the object image ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button look , you can see how the pig@@ ment looks like this .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments will only have a matt black material , because you need to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . now , there are many possibilities now , but take the sim@@ pl@@ est way now .
if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , just click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you cross your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course you are not the colour scheme . you have to set two new attributes . in the colour list , you &apos;ll need to specify two new attributes . then you can do this entry twice ( you can do this also more often , but the box @-@ color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select the colors in the view of the object characteristics :
this step you should already be able to execute , because you should have the fundamental labor mode of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you can already agree . the ball is just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input , or press the button ) , so the ball would swal@@ low over the ground , because you have moved the floor for a unit down@@ wards .
of course , ren@@ dering results are now a strange result : as already before , the glob@@ ular surface is like a mat black material . put in the following step into a suitable material .
if you have chosen the sphere , you can now refer to a material . as already in the bottom , give the ball a pig@@ ment as a color :
select the first subject , and change the name for example in the pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment , then choose one color and adjust the values as follows :
but you can reach an interesting effects if you take time to set some finish characteristics :
then change values like in the following screen photos and click on Apply or press the input .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already yiel@@ ded some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of which opportunities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and hopefully you &apos;ve already learned something that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ earning is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ ders hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera which is reflected in the scene ) through any pixel size , reflecting the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as atmospheric effects such as mi@@ sts . so , the scene is processed into pixel .
as you can imagine , you will not see without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously every scene , that should be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the extension extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in default file dialog you can select a file that you have created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if there is a new file , you must enter a name and location space .
rest@@ art@@ ing the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been rejected since the last store .
you can only select this menu entry only if you haven &apos;t stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . select this menu entry only if you have used machining .
save the current window order and opens up a dialog box , enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the appearance , key short@@ cut and standard behaviour .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new .
opens a dialog to set up the tool bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add commands and remove .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a possibility to accum@@ ulate rough surfaces , without alter@@ ing any be@@ ers on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it &apos;s usual to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then be processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images .
images can be displayed either in one &apos;s own window in size , image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; cubic show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can click on the button &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return .
you can adjust whether any picture should appear in a window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first signs of fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . if a suitable file name is found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in the dialog mit &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards of cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of &amp; ball show ; in the two other , short commands for ad windows and short commands for the browser , the ke@@ epers can be set for each window .
if this is selected , then the images are open in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area should be filled with the background colour that you can go further below . default is not a full screen mode .
if this point is activated , load &amp; zi@@ pper show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still choose the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; in order to open the name of the last @-@ opened folder . next start , open &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can send &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; so set that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also be displayed .
this option is extended for large images to display the display window on the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
speci@@ fies whether the sli@@ deshow starts with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the change of a slide show . to change the value , you can insert a new value in the input field or use the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until they will be canc@@ eled by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cut for the various modes of business and c@@ ud@@ d@@ show ; in the card cards short commands for ad windows and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
shows great symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short presentation .

&amp; entertainment photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers help each other . if you want to join a more common user from &amp; show@@ photo ; ask yourself any questions about other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should be able to answer this language so powerful .
the best start to join &amp; show@@ photo ; to join in , it is the developer Mail@@ ing list . guide to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show picture ; .
&amp; entertainment photo ; try to give you much control of its work processes as possible . there are many options to access the behavior of &amp; entertainment photo . in order to access these settings , you &apos;ll need to set up in the menu settings . you can switch between these changes by pressing the symbols of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color , which is displayed if the under@@ - or over@@ exposed indi@@ st@@ ator should be selected . skills should be displayed by what you are to show , contrast . under@@ supply should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and promotions to the selected images . the same side@@ bar is also available in image editing . you can display them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more images than images and scan them .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that are no more power to scan and en@@ rich . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can copy a dialog to Save or save the pictures immediately in a specified file with automatically generated names and format . the user can also save the pictures before the store .
you can check the status of your scanner regarding the s@@ ane project page by check the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanners can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command @-@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog is open to selecting the scanner .
the user can choose to use the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; end .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) , these options are not especially treated .
to select an image , the user can only start a gli@@ can and then start scanning for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to select the picture , the user can zoom in the image and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview in the window fits .
if the picture has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before storing a preview can be displayed in the settings , then the picture will be displayed in a prec@@ lu@@ sion window , as shown below . when storing is pressed , then the picture will be stored and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a break and you will return to the main window .
by the button settings , the same named dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
users can view the image if desired , before storing . in this case , the option must be selected before storing a preview . if this preview is not desired , then the option must be selected .
this attitude allows them to select the way such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images records . dialog for storing any picture opens the dialog for each image open . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically should be stored automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select store without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the pictures stored in the option save without using a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored for each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for dialog for Save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images automatically and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog for Save . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of every time when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
users can adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value changes the compression value when you choose the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button about starts the K@@ DE About -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and shots can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to end .

you may need to set existing multimedia buttons so that they operate as &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ short commands work . this makes you make your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ arok branches ; -@@ Control Centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP function@@ alities from collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists and scripts ; look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; additionally Amar@@ ok added some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed due to a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all required modules are available and use dialog , so the user does not run why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand the needed functions . you will quickly find that the script is relatively simple .
using D@@ COP can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use d@@ co@@ p ; which should lie each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the exec@@ uting of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is mostly called to be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to use . here , an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason scripts will be able to monitor their default settings and react appropri@@ ately to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use .
configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . for storing and loading of the setup data each script needs to take care of each script . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the file folder to the ste@@ wards where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script might now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the pitch length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals an amendment to volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ mer@@ it@@ em@@ Title : Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of play@@ list if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be specified . to remove the menu you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ special it@@ em@@ Title ) . to remove one entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ special it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok branches off ; or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. recording work . for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed by a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can be optionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so users can clearly recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 , only script packages will accept the extension of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should correct your script packages right .
the main critical review must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
when your script is completed , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and depend on the Wik@@ i scripts page by &amp; am@@ arok ; depend on your entry on K@@ DE @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ arok ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; &amp; am@@ arok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprising to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok ; you can easily draw music into play@@ list instead of going through endless menus . maybe you are looking for only a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos; s Collec@@ ting Browser and the Quick Search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is exactly the right one for you . and if you still lose the decision , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ list automatically the right music according to specific criteria .

&amp; am@@ arok ; has the most applications that you can enable or de@@ activate the configure script with the configure script . this is a list of available options available .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details can be found in section Systems .
activ@@ ating de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to assist you by &amp; am@@ arok , you should use full .
&amp; am@@ arok branches ; can be set up without trouble on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ arok branches ;
player windows automatically switches the player window in addition to play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be specified .
tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar has been compiled . this option switches the experimental function of the m@@ ild@@ hood .
tuning full : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar has been compiled . this makes the used colour scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
image files on the music files : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar is compiled . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder from &amp; am@@ arok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which brow@@ sers of &amp; am@@ arok branches ; should be started when a browser is required .
other brow@@ sers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
play@@ list when storing , records the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; am@@ arok ; dis@@ able this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when you end .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you turn off this setting , &amp; am@@ arok branches ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of play@@ list , then the absolute position of the music files will be saved .
a current piece of change can be observed , that the play@@ lists window open / rolled , in order to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
automatically switch to the context of the context @-@ browser , automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
the section displays you &amp; am@@ arok ; custom@@ ize the appearance . the section is in three parts sub@@ section .
in the font section , you can set the use of different writings in &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise you can use the Scrip@@ tures . you can select scripts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . press on selecting ... , so you can choose one font from the selection dialog .
with a selection of user @-@ defined colour scheme , you own the Qu@@ al of the choice and can set up their own colour scheme . use them , including activated color choice for front and background colour .
starting at the start , &amp; am@@ arok branches ; after the program start , play automatically with the play on the spot which it has been hal@@ ted during the last date .
the sub @-@ window on screen display allows you to display the switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is required , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can look at the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click to choose ... to choose from the dialog box font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text in the O@@ SD is displayed .
to use your own colors , you can use the option to adjust O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . click on the color surfaces using the dialog for color selection . when using colors do not activated , the default &amp; K@@ DE will be used .
the input field display text display the text in the O@@ SD . through which type of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to its own needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen monitor is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . so you can set up on which screen of a multi @-@ way monitor environment will appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio @-@ card audio @-@ edition allows you to select an audio driver from the box field . some drivers can activate further adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the card collection will be used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ arok branches ; according to music files , select the check@@ box next to its name . this section also contains check@@ boxes for inser@@ ts , as should be used with the selected folder .
browse the sub@@ folder as well : this causes &amp; am@@ arok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folder to music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; am@@ arok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search took place to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists import@@ ing that &amp; am@@ arok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) will add to your collection . the play@@ lists will then appear in the play@@ list browser .
part of the collections database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field drivers : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another device in the sub @-@ window is needed .
the MySQL device is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ arok ; under calcul@@ ator : if the machine is installed , the database is entered under port : the network port is entered under which the database is reach@@ able . name : is the database name , which is connected to the connection .
use us@@ ername : and password : to insert the data required for the database connection .
the card load last@@ .@@ f@@ m addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m a . &amp; am@@ arok ; can transmit the names of played pieces on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations concerning the current piece .
here you enter your user name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
to submit the played pieces and update so the profile : this setting allows you to transfer it &amp; am@@ arok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
other interpre@@ ters are called : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; am@@ arok branches ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters included in each piece . note : you need a list in the context browser . note : you need no last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screens .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs have installed ( including the programs contained , because &amp; am@@ arok ; do some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile k@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions such as the O@@ SD predic@@ ts that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties for example . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will be able to make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can also see this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and app@@ end the cap@@ tive file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and let the collection recre@@ ate again .
mostly this is that Tag@@ li@@ b will contain during reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; am@@ arok ; is something more sophisticated .
make sure that all of &amp; am@@ arok branches ; libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ arok branches ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to overthrow the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able the machine . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is an frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error has been fixed .
this is because many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ info , but these are not known as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &apos; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error while writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ arok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic play@@ list ) can be seen in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can fix the status de@@ activ@@ ates on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you can click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if am@@ aro@@ K can see the correct Q@@ t library . you can see with the ld@@ d &apos;@@ Or@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you possibly need to remove any col@@ li@@ zing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems clari@@ fy the easiest way through using any experts your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for the developers . use the Forum and the IR@@ C below ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ arok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please only wear a mistake if you &apos;re on the correction of a mistake in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ arok ; only an empty play@@ list appears . how will music come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then , drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ up window was converted to the statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of this symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the list of evaluations must be displayed in the play@@ list . click on the title bar column to specify the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .

no . yeah , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question remains What media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support so pretty every only imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even add text and P@@ NG !
it may be ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , giving you no MP3 Dec@@ or ( for pat@@ ent@@ ational reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , integration
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ arok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the tractor driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem cause and a solution . for g@@ amer you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ acks ) .
doing &amp; am@@ arok branches ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded for most people if you are reading a dec@@ or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and send the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . g@@ amer can type directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ori@@ ety ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( real @-@ time pri@@ ori@@ ety ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ra@@ pper su@@ ction is set :
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause damage to play . read this error report . read the sound puzzle in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install the K@@ DE @-@ multimedia completely to get faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ b@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been highly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less contracts respond to visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the go@@ er driver , crash@@ es down &amp; am@@ arok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you have to register all components . please register @-@ register to register all G@@ spre@@ e components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you may also ask at the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end up am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download ab@@ m@@ peg file , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete the module folder by G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with post @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run @-@ register once again . then run &amp; am@@ arok branches off .

this rapid guide should show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to test the steps , you need to check out a l@@ ashing installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialogue window , in which you can choose which files you want to burn on CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ less compressed formats , then remember how high the bit@@ rate is possible , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ s@@ ular format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialogue window you can do nothing . wait until the computer has completed the burning process .
this rapid guide should show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to test the steps , you have to have a l@@ ashing installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have inserted the Qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
for copying a data CD , please select Extras , CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings to burn .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings are made , please press the button Start . you can now see a dialog like that or something like this :
in this dialogue window , you can follow the progress of copying process . once the read of the original file is completed in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the overall step has reached 100 % .

cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the internet such programmes are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented free and professional technology to audio en@@ coding and for handling audio data streaming . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competitors to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
lame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . lame will be used by the MP3 Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for low @-@ loss audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder and external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them on an audio CD .

trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and Super @-@ video CDs .
Nor@@ mali@@ ze : this tool is useful for creating the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it can be useful for creating from mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without Nor@@ mali@@ ze , the different recording bars of various albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces are different .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to launch a CD and automatically play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the corresponding sub@@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on the entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project was already saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked after a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folders and file names for the project file .
stores all the open projects . this is the same as if you would save for every single project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what will happen . you can then dis@@ card between saving and changes . furthermore , you can break down the hose and keep the project so open .
includes all the open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ stored project , what is meant to happen , just as if you were called for each project file .
includes all the open projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not stored project will be asked what to happen if you had called the file .
if you call this entry , you can select the same effect when you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same button as the properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . the burning dialog lets only open when the project contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can carry many projects related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only be used for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you are using files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you are not used for a multi @-@ session CD , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you to see the files available on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function allows to remove files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a sample of a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also use the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal head . you should also prefer Cl@@ one if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows to create a DVD copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a DVD copy of a DVD with the help of a DVD with the help of a DVD . alternatively , the target medium has to be big enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens dialogue to delete a CD @-@ RW drive . thus , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
opens the dialog to the form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialogue , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format which will be completely er@@ ased with the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b allows you to choose between the writing modes and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously produced CD image . the dialog will ask for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pushing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , for this you need to use other tools like N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously developed DVD image . the dialog ask for a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can be burned immediately by pushing the burning button .
a previously named DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window appears , usually after reading a DVD in the contents view , but can also be used separately . it contains information about the selected video , code settings and even options for modi@@ fying the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . these information will be displayed in the contents view and contain properties of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small box at the bottom edge of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed is the status bar .
switches the folder view or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and unlock the drive or throw of the media .
switches the contents view or out . the site view allows the Select and pulling files into the project view . the contents view is also chosen to read audio or video CDs if a drive was chosen with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
sh@@ uts the head@@ bar into the projection view or out . the head@@ bar is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the project view has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clear from the remaining views .
this opens a dialogue window to modify the keyboard orders for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . after one of the available commands in the upper part is selected , you can adjust the key options below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistance systems . thus , system administrator rights can be used to burn CDs and DVDs . for that , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can make general code settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b may work on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alise and the implementation of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functionality to use , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or that can use a more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope , therefore , rather your taste and type of task is crucial , which add the accompanying programs you give .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions can be done before , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then , enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have common all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features to create new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Audio CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) Vo@@ id copy@@ d@@ vd ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result , such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method is given a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Alternative to use the project via using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project With using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface , which is applicable only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
Vo@@ id cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) Vo@@ id cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( URL : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ String ) Vo@@ id add@@ ur@@ ls ( URL : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ string computing ) Vo@@ id Sho@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string &#93; ) Vo@@ id ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) Vo@@ id set@@ id ( Q@@ string )
therefore , it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT creamy / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; - Select for &amp; K@@ DE ; with him can easily be stored audio CD ; s read and be stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder of the computer installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( to read &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard drive ) and many co@@ di@@ ers to en@@ code these WAV files ( non @-@ loss compression ) . more co@@ ils can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) is compressed to MP@@ 3- or OGG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read out the &amp; CD ; it is compiled by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ ils are already present , so it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile something . if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
which co@@ di@@ ers / file format is to be used ? a small introduction about co@@ ils , audio quality and com@@ pressing factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator : cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection . not to avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . avoid the purchase of copying protection . avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily use of information is found . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will stum@@ ble on the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which code labels are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the Free@@ D@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the main sequence . on the page Step by step example , you will find further information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB will start the CD@@ DB file according to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case , first the connection to the internet must be made . )
starts the read and - when a en@@ coder was configured in the Code software tab - the en@@ coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the standard . it is to be noted that before the en@@ coder board tab was configured in the dialog box dialog .
opens the file manager , so the file manager will en@@ code you instead of using a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the kind of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; completed ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different box cards ( as Encoder , for setting the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ils , and compression rates , and helps you to choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ator .
if no audio information is lost , there will be a los@@ s@@ less audio format . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files .
using audio formats , lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most frequent . OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower rate rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but about this bit rate will generate less important , since both co@@ ders are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , &apos; lame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high quality sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at lower rate rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or when one of the few existing OGG files are available .
MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special Auto @-@ stereo systems . today - early 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting com@@ pres@@ sions for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency to most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of titles . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ ographic facilities . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos;@@ = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this attitude will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you have absolutely the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are entered manually or using the program automatically from the Free@@ D@@ b program , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be handed / used in the program to create file and file names as well as the attributes of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs there is often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here . the manual or help to the co@@ er@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles to be added if MP@@ 3@@ s will be encoded with lame , the counter -@@ tt of lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator : added . the result looks as follows : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button code in the assistant ) :
that &apos;s what the Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database , in which persons can read / enter the information , so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself . it is said to be allowed only by text : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ eber@@ le ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; no more or less worth@@ less , so the information can not be added to the music company damage . all information can be combined with a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ date ; it is active in a check@@ box address ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used in the system ( this can only know the programmer , who has reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ date is set up ; to use Free@@ D@@ b , the geographical will need to be needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and is compar@@ ing the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of reflec@@ tions for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information about reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually a month is created ) only the updates of the database .
what your reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to be more precise , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; . to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first , if this is not done yet .
for saving WAV files , the code can be selected and thus choose the desired file format . when opening , pre @-@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less com@@ pressing for audio data ) can be added to the Code of the Code . other co@@ ders can be added to this tab tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ers package must be installed from the associated Linux distribution before the code can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ ils . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter of the Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after the installation of a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ator , further information on the switch will be obtained via the input of a command like lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) , &apos; lame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ator .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , write and readers of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in one terminal . this could give a hint of what is wrong .
check if you do not want a copy of audio CD ; check out . control the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to advance .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to establish those areas that do the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , starting everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) .
there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for lame can be found as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , whatever you can do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write permission on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section handles the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ date ; , something which is probably done only once and
the second section describes the preview to read a &amp; CD , which has to be repeated for each in@@ sufficient &amp; CD ;
here we determine the code quality ( lame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) and which structure will be used . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to download the Free@@ D@@ b around the &amp; CD ; data from the internet download .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to read it out of a &amp; CD while once the appropriate settings are found .
the device model will be delivered to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this can &apos;t work or if more than one &amp; CD / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to use the entries for the file names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
general settings . here are not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined here . in our example , everything will be shown / entered as shown in screen photo .
please select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information is missing from keyword ( tags ) .
the card @-@ card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; cd to download the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b machine .
note : the machine must be connected during reading &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Internet , so that it can access the Free@@ D@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts the read of the &amp; CD ; which is later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , can be easily changed and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
aside from this example it is further to be noted : if you want to manually use it manually , use the select button and Free@@ D@@ b mode . however , you can use Free@@ D@@ b locally on line mode . however , you can be selected using Free@@ D@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is Free@@ D@@ b for Free@@ D@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving &amp; CD ; information from the Free@@ D@@ b server about the Internet . how do the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ D@@ b . see everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB Server : please go to the website fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this track , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both will work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls need the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , there may be more happiness with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf on the internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ D@@ b server . the first check@@ box should be dis@@ able .
simply take the settings from screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously permitted pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time in only one existing drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore try to try .
CD ; check out the last piece of play : check this on to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must be specified in the file / file , if only space is available on another drive . if the field is not listed , the files will not be specified in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files .
all so set as it is on the screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances , something has to be b@@ lown to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a adjustment for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted at need . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the names of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
do the rest like in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of encoded WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ date ; this configuration is used as standard for each out of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section , it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , which is organized on hard drive , as we want to collect MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data of the Free@@ D@@ b will be able to pick up . the process that is described in this section will be repeated for each in@@ sufficient &amp; CD ;
since we have a &amp; CD , you don &apos;t have a bit different from Free@@ D@@ b , you will see the screen photos from a little different from Free@@ D@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of fet@@ ch them out of the internet . comments are shown on the differences .
do not attempt to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD has to be released in the drive which has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and accessed by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then search in the section questions and answers to the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up from the Free@@ D@@ b , all tracks are completed and are also shown by the artist &apos;s name and album .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best for your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not selected the check@@ box for the automatic query of Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , but the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input the CD data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the play in the first line of the line &apos; actu@@ ator title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered at the input field &apos; Aktu@@ ell title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments . the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from Free@@ D@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to review the content of the CD editor , so you can not only begin with the artist and album names ( e.g. all words with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ i@@ red remarks .
note : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of one piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags ; this option is set up on the tab menu settings ; take a look at the tab &apos; Basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all co@@ ils or file formats . see the help to the code to obtain more information .
just select one entry , which is obviously with the style of an extension CD ; this example is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD , anyway . for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album is already filled with the called data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the date printed on any case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and procedure to the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories .
it is the third button of the tool bar . notice that the artist and the album will be shown on the play list .
note that there is a check sign before each line of a piece . only the titles can be selected as marked . make sure that all pieces are selected , or get the button to select all pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button selection . read the reading process , so this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the entries and track what is going on .
on the tab , click on the switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a code that have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target file are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have writing access to the temporary files and target file ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have one new entry : order 4 is the en@@ coding of pieces 1 into format MP3 . so check out and code in parallel . notice the status information in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and en@@ code . at most powerful machines the result is un@@ clear . the computer used machine with an am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem when simultaneous interpre@@ ting and en@@ coding ( of course two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window appears .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x and 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; are available today within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S as part of the multi @-@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ date ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package packages . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files , and not for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you :
a program which calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best check the step by step example to get the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked up after the first time of the program , without any occasion as it should go on from that somehow empty screen ( especially if the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) or from the un@@ usually short menu from ?
what is it about ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can &apos;t stop this manual . it is intended to add this manual . it is intended to do something useful or change , may it do . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he would leave this section and therefore agree with this suggestion .
strange when you managed to get the source file from the &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others , he has some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound projection screen , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ cer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of activity every MIDI channel by high@@ lighting of the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go in &amp; K@@ DE ; each MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window can pull down to the mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( rec@@ u@@ sions or textile events ) . K@@ Mid controls the process automatically .
meeting support . if you &amp; K@@ DE ; during the recording of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you select the desired song .
you can also add a file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window drops . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a music piece , open it and press the button in the tool bar , select the entry record from the menu , or get the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start when you pull it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then play each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is set off , you can jump to any place by using the medium mouse button and drive along with the regulator .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right the speed display , and so the speed speed can change . to re @-@ get the original speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button , or selecting the menu entry break in the menu , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . get the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play reproduction .
lyrics can be stored on two types in one music piece . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set up what events are to be presented and even better : the event type is selected automatically , so you will not have to manually setup the entry automatic text code . however , you will always have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up a event type , select from the menu settings the entries text events or song events . same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ize . these are set up in this section as you can efficiently use collections efficiently .
to put a collection , first open the collection manager . here you will find in the menu collection below the point . click here on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set up the di@@ aries on the collection manager .
into the temporary collection all songs , which you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . read the if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , she has to add to the collection manager . there , you can add the button to add a song . again , it appears the file dialog , with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
if automatic adding is enabled , a piece of opening ( open to file open or drag &amp; drop ) will be added to the active collection .
if automatic adding to the collection is not activated , it will be activated and emp@@ tied the temporary collection at opening a piece . this collection will then be added to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the section following from the sub @-@ menu sequence of the menus , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be specified .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list above the Karaoke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the button arrow to the right .
to jump a song , select the button in the previous piece , the entry pre@@ defined piece from the menu or press the button arrow to the left .
to er@@ ase a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection , and click the button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , as it is saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that understands syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all events of type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in terms of the change patch patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus can always sound a trumpet if you should play a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all Sound@@ cards are GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite column ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications to play a piece of play .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear so often as desired . requirement for this is that every occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... End Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Another key@@ map ... &quot; End Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
they see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and end that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail to allow me to come in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
this section is indicated how the patches of General MIDI can be displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to lay all the sounds that supports this instrument ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a plum@@ ber . for this purpose , you can carry out the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
if so , if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( the drum code ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is contained in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch included , with each tone a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the sound level of the same drum ( like some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how tones can be displayed on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
like the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple keyboard for each channel and each instrument . you have to use different names only in the first row .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form tones on the per@@ cr@@ ate canal . check out the supplied key@@ note as an example .
this section can be used to change some channels on others . if you want to change the first and the second channel , do it simply in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the per@@ k@@ ussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices require 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is depicted on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the corresponding keyboard must be defined further in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example , to always use the wi@@ per @-@ patch on the per@@ k@@ screen channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio , in which relationship Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied by the value , it will be converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that there is no dec@@ imal number in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM is giving a keyboard to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der Event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some keyboards will try to play two sounds up to an oc@@ tave above . in order to try the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings . you can find it in the menu , settings , point MIDI settings .
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole range of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ v@@ atures you see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the can@@ al@@ view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can choose an instrument , the button does not make more green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the can@@ al@@ view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played tones . in the menu , select the Settings menu below the item Kan@@ al@@ View : settings
the temp@@ o @-@ LCD displays speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so , for example , find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the speed , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . that can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same scores in very different ways .
good , I can do not force , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to solve the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home page )
I &apos;d like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , that &apos;s why &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , choose all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
automatically dis@@ able the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can get the arrow button on the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the temp@@ o , click the LCD double @-@ click .
I have on a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or listen ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or if I want to play a file , merely go to the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; change the window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file only , without using it to a collection , turn the setting automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so , put the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then , do you complete , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear this song or see the postcard , it animated me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ el@@ ah ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not a lot of time for my hobbies , but I &apos;m trying to take a bit of time . as hobbies I have program MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me feel happy , write to me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or similar @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really enjoy a huge che@@ er when you send me a postcard from your home town or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to send a MIDI file , but you should contact me when I have the file already .

and of course , my thanks also applies to all of these excellent musicians on the net that give us this wonderful Mi@@ di@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this you can find &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which can be found on the website below htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can also watch the development , find information and look at the links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I highly recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .
if any problems arise , contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as playback of DVD , VCD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not completed yet when &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed if information is restored .
it is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu book@@ mark , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries you should use after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ arch@@ ists . if you have an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked record .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , TV and continuous play@@ list may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that , but also by using the application itself . just click on a name of a category cli@@ cks , on the menu view , and as next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content is displayed this part .
after changing XML files , you need to be selected from the menu with play@@ list and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when editing mode or any other group will be selected without the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on using the XML configuration files ..
the animation during boot and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change of &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 . if the option is not available , it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to activate other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during boot needs not be short , it will automatically be completed by opening another source . this would be dis@@ rupted by the end @-@ animation , but the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be advertis@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = &quot; meet &quot; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; in the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory test / some examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a Rider on configuration of M@@ Player in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path of the M@@ Player and the cache size of the file ro@@ ms can be set out from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the edition of M@@ Player .
there is no rider for this playback device in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual processing file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ amp@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played in &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service providers for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assign@@ ments by K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is to run in a consol@@ es application and to browse after error messages related to the browser module library . the gest@@ ure process is called cra@@ p@@ player . if there is no mistake , the back@@ end edition is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
that always has taken a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been identified ) , this must be done by manual change in the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV @-@ cards either by using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires c@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be used manually and the configuration file can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player dialog can be found in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there ought to be detected , from which one is selected . the suitable code needs to be found ( e.g. , it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably included a DVB .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only work X@@ Video ( probably this type of playing video equipment under Linux is the only works ) . this is why the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension is required for the X server . this is why the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

lat@@ ex ; : a professional uni@@ formity application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably based on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the formats used &amp; Linux ; distribution will be included . for installation , the distribution of distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distribution . these enable a simple installation without further comp@@ ile and are contained on the k@@ ile ; web site contain .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users have to hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation is considered . if the support for this project or documentation is desired , the contact via the k@@ ile ; web site should be manufactured .
if you have any questions or comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or when extensions are desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

just like other signat@@ ory languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized properties such as paper size , aspect ratio and text patterns will be defined by the command \ \ uni@@ tive { document } and must be closed again with the \ \ \ \ command { document } .
the Fast @-@ A@@ scen@@ sion assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a recent function for the rapid development of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some possibility for the creation of the document . it can also be done some of the document related settings .
document categories : this article is described with the type of document document : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; Report &#93; , article &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ &#93; &#93; , PA &#91; projector &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : this will execute the default en@@ coding . modern systems use UTF @-@ 8 en@@ coding as standard . if using UTF @-@ 8 , UTF @-@ 8 should be used as default settings ( for correct processing of lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most frequently used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only have to be balanced in the check@@ box field .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find using German text to create German text .
new users now don &apos;t worry . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; hur@@ ry ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , at@@ titudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; there is a simple trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting of a gr@@ ind content on the screen . however , it will not be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and time .
in case of a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ &apos; s command { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a empty line ( for inser@@ tion of the text ) and the add @-@ in line to close ( e.g. \ \ \ \ command { command } ) . this function can be de@@ pressed in menu settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ contrac@@ ted element ) :
at the top of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed by a mouse click on the respective and viewed .
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; file search may be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; framed file &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ hur@@ ry ; by clicking with the middle button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI file format contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information such as font size &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the device @-@ search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor is encoded with PFT and as soon as a element in DVI ; file @-@ search is the exact opposite . as soon as you click on a section in the lat@@ ex ; source code , it becomes available in DVI ; viewer viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used to work with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simplified using other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted for project settings .
quick @-@ construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no error in the source code ) .
file recovery : in this mode , the DVI ; file to be desired , and there is no appeal by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; according to the quick@@ ening .
when looking for the editing list , the three gro@@ wers should be developed for the rapid integration of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the rapid integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... Contin@@ u@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the select button for further information is available for items such as keywords , mer@@ g@@ ings notes or references . these are available :
name : with this command , a name for one section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of a selection box ) .
when using quote , select a select list with literary entries . at &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x , this only works if the file is necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; &amp; files can be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand it is written .
the final selection field with the name of the letter will be used for the definition of the font . it can be specified , the font images will be specified . there are the following font images :
with the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection options are available : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and legend of the settings . 2 . this document may be written with the hand .
the par@@ enth@@ esis on the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the characters &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code is entered , the lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of the volume building or of the button .
the source code must be stored before the compilation . &amp; hur@@ ry ; for storing the storage automatically .
the comp@@ iling of the document , should be sought in the log@@ ging according to errors . when using quick assembly , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , it should also be considered the log@@ ging .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font size is 12 , and only a few images should have a different scrip@@ ture . the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the changes are available within the environment ( from \ \ ) to { \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
there are many possibility to read the ability of read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . there are , for example , certain types of fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ divisions , etc . , these commands are either connected to the \ \ \ &apos; command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Directory { emp@@ h } : this command is available for the cur@@ ative printing and is long as long as it is closed , until he is closed with a \ \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . one single word in one sentence can be displayed in a set of \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quota : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ &apos; begin { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
after writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex pattern ; shown in the background , follow a step @-@ for @-@ step guidance for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once the wi@@ zard was entered a bit text , a few adjustments for the improved read@@ ability of the document should be completed . to this end , a quote from a few places in the fat and cran@@ ial print and a poem went to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be turned back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi edition such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , these are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed using file ( in the viewer ) ( unless the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar convin@@ ces the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code has been created , the conversion can begin to split other formats using the button P@@ FE in the tool bar .
the front search for the direct jump from the editor for the added position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; hur@@ ry ; offers a corresponding adjustment for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . only Modern under Settings K@@ ile set up ... tools B@@ auen are balanced .
in order to carry out the desired search , the mouse poin@@ ter in a line of source code needs to be cli@@ cked on , close to front @-@ search engine . the leap to the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is done then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; open and to the appropriate line . this must be set &amp; k@@ ile ; available in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ( default settings ... Editor )
if using quick construction of &amp; DVI ; viewer doesn &apos;t open , there may be an error . if a bug is required , this will be displayed in the log@@ is@@ hable file or in the message window .
the log@@ is@@ hable file also accounts for error source in the source code . in the editor , the text file will always be able to view the error message in which the error message appears . in order to view f@@ law@@ ed line , it must be cli@@ cked and hur@@ ry ; jump to error message .
as soon as the button on the tool bar is cli@@ cked , a window appears on the selection of using template for the document . the pre @-@ set values are :
with a selection of empty document , a document can be used either by reason to re @-@ written or the assistant to create a new document . further information is included in the section .
current users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , it must be created either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file open or a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template based on an existing document and selection of file from a document .
creating a new document from a template using file New will be replaced by some strings through other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... Settings General .
for creating its own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables will be replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering document class . typically , it will be used as the following : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to creating a template is the use of the wi@@ zard and thus verb@@ ose to the commands in the editor . once the document has been made to this way , the following steps have been accomplished :
by creating a new document , its own template , instead of the standard , can be balanced .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files created . will be a simple way to create a template , should be searched after one on the Internet , and that can be followed under the steps described below .
&amp; gt ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ability of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; they can be made directly from the menu .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to experience his attention , the manual of Kate should be attracted . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can start reading the master &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; hur@@ ry ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command refer@@ ential , which can be called for the Men@@ Ã ¼ of La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click on the C@@ tex key , around the &amp; tex . that means that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when pulling the text , the text will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with dr@@ ated switch , open parts of the source code in the Edi@@ tor@@ window .
&amp; ile ; has the possibility to browse the most diverse species of source codes and empha@@ size these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands of normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants spread themselves . this is a unique type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ ue covers or the corresponding key stamp is empha@@ sized , so that this jump brand is empha@@ sized , so that it will automatically be used in the first input of a character .
the processor is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already outstanding choices for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for their selection . under adap@@ ters , the following commands are included in the text selection :
if a complete paragraph consists of ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . this advanced meaning does not include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this is the only p@@ airing thing in &amp; k@@ ha@@ ste ; this means that the accounts are separated by two empty lines .
the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an advanced meaning because this command also contains lat@@ ex ; orders with a r@@ ins@@ ed star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for example , a part of the document can be removed and removed through the key of the key . &amp; Kate ; it offers the key element C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire row is removed . &amp; gt ; with own commands this can be removed with own commands . under adap@@ tion , the following commands are included in the text of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a ship@@ ments in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit accounts .
it has already been clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under Edit environment for a beautiful ease of work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will be inj@@ ected directly from the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the order to open the environment .
this command will be inj@@ ected directly behind the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor moves before or within the command \ \ &apos; round { environment } , the end of the environment is inj@@ ected ( or vice versa ) .
during the entry of many w@@ asted environment commands , this instruction can be lost quickly . this command will close the most important environment , so that the lost environment structure will not be broken .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that will be determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond from editing environment .
this command will be inj@@ ected directly to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the welded cl@@ amp .
with this command , the end of the current group is inj@@ ected ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the cut @-@ out bracket .
if the cur@@ sor moves before or behind the soft@@ ened cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , the other end of the group is inj@@ ected ( or vice versa ) .
during the entry of many har@@ ass@@ orted groups bra@@ ckets can go quickly to the eye view . this command will close the most important group , so that the emb@@ ell@@ ished structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be broken .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple opening mark is used as gene expression . for the purpose of the initial implementation is used in &amp; k@@ hur@@ ry ; the sign &quot; for two simple instructions will be used . &quot; &amp; hur@@ ry ; knows this case and allow for two close processing signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double beginnings can be set under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and hold off .
there are also possible specific settings ( e.g. n@@ x , French ) , or French or French beginners . there are also many other languages available .
when using Shift ; input @-@ down , &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent fence . if the current position within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is located , not only a line of line but at the same time the command \ \ item is one .
close to a tables and close , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelli@@ gently enough to under@@ line pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be set under settings . set up ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables , and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ha@@ ste ; if this tab is not the added tab@@ ulator in the present line . although this tab is not possible , add &amp; k@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current t@@ ach@@ ator .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source of source , it has been expanded in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to provide special commands ( usually available for lat@@ ex ; ) , three of these modes are available for automatic verification . all these modes are set for different work settings and settings ...
at the beginning of a new environment with the command \ \ &apos; round { environment } becomes &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added the command \ \ &apos; { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
in addition , the last letter of the input will be removed , the last letter of the input will be removed , and therefore , the list may be reduced by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameter . the descriptions will be found in a selection of a command . alternatively , jump brands are also enclosed , so that a simply jump to these positions can be found using the existing spr@@ int brand .
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; Con@@ ven@@ tional settings to these lists are made . it can be used various kinds of furniture for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as possible use of the common language use .
the instruction mode is not allowed to be entered into a few letters with \ \ &apos; s . on the other hand , there is a large list of setting commands to be entered . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for deep@@ ening environments is available .
the command is automatically shut down in the menu or the key r@@ zel Alt + switch button , the order to open in the environment automatically and it appears to be \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued on the easiest way and will be termin@@ ated by typ@@ ing the input .
after this is completed , the environment will be closed again . once &amp; k@@ hur@@ ry ; recognize that it is a lists environment , is even a first \ \ item command set with .
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; Con@@ ven@@ tional settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the key list of the case @-@ written mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
drop &amp; ile ; under@@ line user @-@ defined lists of decre@@ asing , which will be replaced immediately by using at@@ ile character strings . the lists can be set up under settings . as an example of a remote list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l is contained in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word is fully re@@ designed by the Men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ zel C@@ tr@@ l + Alt empty bar , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
great honey@@ s are not helpful for automatic trans@@ missions . however , it has been determined that many might be written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ha@@ ste ; the ful@@ fill@@ ment for all already written might be written .
this mode can be set up in the Men@@ ile Settings ... K@@ ile distor@@ tion @-@ free can be deported . here also the swelling value can be specified .

the dialogue graphics are designed to describe graphics as simple as possible . in order to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and be considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer a superb basis for changes and new@@ com@@ ings of pages . if the PDF output is possible , the pages can be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools re@@ arranged and then be converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to make the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed into creating creating , creating and creating the creation .

a fully @-@ owned Ref@@ ern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its name is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for searching for a particular form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks .
because of the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as is delivered , finding the correct document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and hier@@ arch@@ ers .
all documents are divided into categories and the open advantage is the search for package names or drums . of &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click on the mouse or the bed of space use the viewer for the document .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source code editor that can be used on all systems with installed &amp; K@@ DE ; - and Unix @-@ related systems . &amp; K@@ DE ; is also a part of the Fin@@ k project , which means &amp; k@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be touched .
many thanks to those who are seeking to continue the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ project stri@@ ve to sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools we can use all of the contemp@@ t of &amp; GNU / licensing . recent information about the contributions is available in the volume aid .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , may have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can now benefit from the additional functionality and must not wait until someone can use the th@@ ier in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used .
to install a plug @-@ in or one part , we start with the menu plug@@ in . so the following dialog is opened :
this dialogue allows all the plug @-@ ins to manage and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT :
here you can type the search engine . add plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to the search of plug@@ ins .
many people work in a project several individuals in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of user and serves for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can look out of the list of team members who he is . this happens by telling the Team Member from the list and expresses the button S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold as you are : text .
nick@@ name and the attitude of your own identity are important for messages and notes . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
next to the overview of her team , there is another advantage with the capture of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leader if something specific is happening . see in for further information .
event promotions are actions that are carried out if something specific in the project is done . an example would be the draw of opening and closing of the project , so much someone worked , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script that plays a file to CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the recipient list selected address data . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how , we@@ i will be set up next .
comments are specific comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
note : it is possible to select either the note @-@ associated entry from the editor @-@ tab or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by text @-@ text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the nick@@ name @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) , with the nick@@ name of the team member , should be cited as a role in the project leader after the enrich@@ ing and sub @-@ project leaders in the examples below .
nick@@ name and roles names are independent of large or small holes , but spaces for the bra@@ ckets and the note : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing , the DT@@ D @-@ only table is and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings can be found via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description of the others can be found .
settings can be set by settings Qu@@ ant@@ a ... called . This dialog covers some sites that are treated each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags , which can be changed , the entries are :
large / Sm@@ aller tags of tags : large / small copy of automatically added tags . regular major / small note means the tags will be inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
large / small sch@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase of attributes : large / small sample of automatically added attribute . normal Great / Klein@@ sch@@ ens@@ hr@@ ase means , attributes such as they are described in the day XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if required , is optional for tags that is optional for the closing day , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
automatically update the starting and closing day : if enabled , the appropriate closing day is changed and vice versa .
automatic acc@@ ent of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding code during en@@ typ@@ ing .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . using the default , the default configuration can be restored .
standard character coding : the en@@ coding of newly created , or in other ways , to open files ( where the en@@ coding of the file can be over@@ taken ) . this attitude will be em@@ itted by the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this attitude will be em@@ itted by the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; created regularly backup copies , so that in a power out@@ age or crash when the next start of the program can be restored . this is not the same as storing the file . even not stored documents will provide a backup regularly , according to the set time , created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the edit area or own view ( or documentation in a cardboard ) that makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview , and source code at the same time .
set the window settings for the next start is useful if the user &apos;s user interface due to change of M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ence command line parameters .
warning message will be used to control the warning of war@@ nings by an@@ ha@@ ken by no more .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode . see the different modes .
the par@@ ser and structure tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser knots in detail , can be adjusted in detail .
in the field of mou@@ sec@@ lick on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action @-@ dissolved action by clicking on the structure tree .
in the field @-@ tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , which should be opened automatically at a change of the structure , and how deep in a change of the structure tree will be shut down . empty knots are the empty sections in the text , while empty groups are found in which the current document was no element .
the short@@ cuts of abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which will be un@@ fold in the edit text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s valid , otherwise it can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause is something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be ad@@ ministr@@ ated here . plug@@ ins are part of the third page , which can be used by any part @-@ enabled application , best @-@ known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following may be provided :
address : the path to the Plu@@ gin , if it &apos;s not at a stand@@ ar@@ as such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information will be transferred to the Plu@@ gin , so it can open the current file , the associated file ( path of the current file ) or the project file .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : verify that the plug@@ in refused to be denied . only @-@ l@@ ese @-@ k@@ Parts usually refuse to loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the given information is correct , then if the plug@@ in is not available , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting is fully newly developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented , which allows various implem@@ ent@@ ations of plug@@ ins .
currently , only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in select button , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bug is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view where the variables displayed by monit@@ or@@ ate variables is displayed . normally , it appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a view , in which all holding points , listed with line numbers and conditions listed . usually appear in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( like in HTML ) is shown in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger . normally , it appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported features of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , manufactured , or she shares the plug@@ in to listen to debit needs . this promotion is triggered by default if a project is opened , that must not be respected in normal case .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ger Session starts the session . closes the connection to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the leaves according to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server for a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger with the execution of the script and to send information on the monitoring variables as well as the current run line will be continuously . if this happens when the script has started , the script will start before a de@@ bug requirement is started , the script starts with the request .
points the de@@ bug@@ gers to start with the execution of the script , without inform@@ ing any information related variables and the current line number . if this happens when a script has been given , the execution starts , as soon as a request is provided .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next instruction in the script , without entering the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and includes in@@ wards .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over and go to the next , as if there was not the current .
opens a dialog box , which can be entered into a variable , or an expression that will be monitored . the super@@ vis@@ ing value will appear in the vari@@ ance view .
with this dialogue , one variable can be entered or a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can help to get better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; skills such as car complet@@ es and scrip@@ ting rooms . their simplicity and flexibility makes up &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are in two types , family 1 , the market @-@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool bars . day folders include two file types , the tag languages and the tool bars . tag files are handy , symbol@@ ised bodies of image cris@@ ps ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , add text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . short , one &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and layout , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool bars allow a quick insert of tags in a document without any danger of writing .
day folders are nothing like folders . they only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files are available in the name of the application language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declared whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is wise to use as many users to use a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes any element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is set in simple manner .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only be found once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just one element .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; one argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . gives the name of the class to where this method is . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a mere element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it features the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags that should be displayed as this attribute shall be displayed , etc ; This is an only element @-@ element element .
speci@@ fies the source codes for the attributes in day @-@ editing dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to meet the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting edge and a method@@ ology name . the arguments that will be passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag assigned the elements of a list together . it can only occur to an attribute . it is a only element @-@ element element .
speci@@ fies the attribute context of a tags within a dialogue . this day can only occur in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a mere element .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a mere element .
all Tag@@ XML files are to begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML Version = 1.0 en@@ coding = 1.0 @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly sealed and closed .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML file , the tools can start up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialogue will appear , whose simple instructions is to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , verification takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
in the following example , an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; -@@ ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , an example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP file will be described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML Version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings . in order to edit a &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be prepared with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = U@@ de 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not indicated , the name is nick@@ named as nick@@ name .
a promotion can set up actions with actions ... and will be created . click on New Action to the same dialog :
this promotion has proven key @-@ escal@@ op@@ es . with clicking on the user button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard is remote .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the determin@@ ated settings and inserted this text in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but on that it is not limited ) , which can change the document or use as input ( or parts of document ) , themselves are the quick@@ start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . this way tries to find the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document , file names will be removed .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; by external script is used .
parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; at default input . in the selection box input can be determined , which is to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected field of document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this attitude .
accordingly , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal edition , on the default error output . it can be specified , which should be done with the default issue written on the default issue , by default the output range is set :
if there are many tags in the market @-@ up language , it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool bar . in the case there &apos;s not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure actions . select at@@ titudes are set .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts to edit mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes does and you use their use , enable you to edit dialog &quot; Tag , &quot; if available , allowing you to use a entry when using the promotion .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should note the action in conjunction with this symbol ? will we replace it before we have difficulty .
for creating a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ ography ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics , other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ icon@@ ese ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose edit size others .
please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ;
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green , usually be interpreted , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user signals that clicking this tool is a &amp; lt ; starting in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and put them on with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK .
suppose you want some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for tool bar add or it should adjust this to a better overview by some separ@@ ator in multiple groups . open the tool@@ bars to set up dialog on tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( on the left above ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element , add the arrow button to the right . this adds an element to the tool bar .
for example , I want to preview a quick way to access the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by sampling all symbols in order to ensure that everything works .
back in the correct file . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it is laid im@@ pedi@@ ted , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct file . please fit their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so on that their tool bar ( s ) is loaded when a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like to like . this is why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document preparation for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to select an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc . language . then you will need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first , we will let you let the second treat us here .
# K@@ DE Con@@ figuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.3 Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is as something like this :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level El@@ ements Top element = PHP 4.2 Tools = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = Pun@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ ony@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content ( except through the reason ) md@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the contents can be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently be shown at the upper end of the tree view &amp; md@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; res@@ sources can be replaced .
the content section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed on the design of context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing the function named and press of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help would display the documentation directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and file @-@ binding lines .
a simple list of using separate context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can store your file do@@ cr@@ c simple and instantly save for $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or copy / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are well and worth it , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to use the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners , or else to whom . at different locations there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , list files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our head archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can be reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and usable for release . in order to make a useful contribution , it is guaranteed to provide a useful contribution , for our team as well as for the later user .
when upload , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can continue to check the input fields filled ( URL @-@ preview ) and by clicking OK the up@@ loading can be started .
upload the upload DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , tool@@ bars can instantly upload , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , investigated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource through the integrity and signature . in the case of problems , it may then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity have been given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the information about the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not made by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the creation can be done simultaneously by using a DT@@ EP package as necessary . there is the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D package into a DT@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D store and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards the following dialogue appears :
target group name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written by this name into the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ i@@ tive line : the string that will appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d will appear
fine adjustment of the DT@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; according to conversion &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , can be adjusted with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this opportunity .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to be able to understand and put full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , this chapter one must first teach them with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projects related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is available , available in common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is possible to secure the group of ad@@ ministr@@ ators of various tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a certain project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns can be set up to work files specifically for the files of a particular project . simple , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder @-@ tree of the project , which makes the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project em@@ ö@@ g@@ licht .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the building views , the boxes with information and the tool bars . please drop in , and for further information on these areas .
clicking with the right mouse button , click to get a context menu with the current document suitable to re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump , or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S command to the current document .
right click in the Edi@@ tor@@ Area to create a further context menu regarding the working document content , such as basic machining steps ( cutting / copy / inser@@ tion ) , processing the file under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , when the string below the mouse poin@@ ter file is called a file .
at the top end of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers are the tool bars of the editor . at the moment , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us exists ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool bars are shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and thereby associated user needs .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; in their document , then click on the data for this just one day . if you want to include a day that has multiple attributes ( as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and pass through . in the presentation with cart@@ on@@ re@@ it@@ ators stand for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation designs available .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or delete the files from the storage medium can be carried out with the displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; it is open to you all possibilities .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working range from . global templates are always available , local templates only use for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project . more about templates is available .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . further functions are available , such as the script will start to edit or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . the cur@@ sor in the document is placed on the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands in terms of navigation and re@@ frac@@ tures of the tree .
this tree appears among other fields of construction . with it , various attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces may change . the modification of all available attributes can be made with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development . it can be downloaded here documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; document site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cart@@ ons on the bottom end of the window , can be reached via the usable information : the message window and the problem window .
this map displays information about each in Qu@@ ant@@ a @-@ running script . for example , the current DT@@ D is displayed and all changes to DT@@ D .
this cart@@ on display shows all errors in the market up of current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that will be executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the tool bar is the opportunity to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; if they have a tool bar in an email , they can backup them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other and charging !
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it has a number of options to be handed over to the configure script . in order to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting at boot &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin file . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before it &apos;s folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a obvious idea : what would happen if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , ext@@ end@@ able market @-@ up languages ? well , this would make him the absolutely brilliant web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ! so it was done .
no longer available on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore the suitable &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be kept , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; report is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can extend the productivity almost every task . through self @-@ kn@@ itting actions , scripts and tool bar , the automation can be able to mem@@ or@@ ate them . ( more about it you will find in . )
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been conceived for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed release and produced a commercial program .
more in the details documentation is with help : / qu@@ ant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ ant@@ a run ) .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; is currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check out in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ ference folder , only one error is reported .
converted to inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ scripts , so that it displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase , which is the correct way to insert special signs and spaces in &amp; URL ; it is primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
this allows you to select the block selection . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shift ; button to select .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error message appears !
looks for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the message window or not at . this is the window , in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
exit and en@@ roll@@ ment of the problem repor@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the problem journalist is activated once you are changing to Struc@@ tured tree .
displays the symbol @-@ old left from the main window . this column allows you to set Book@@ mark with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries to previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks of other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables , to copy files into your project folder or sub @-@ folders and then add it to the project .
load files in your project on your server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves ) .
at@@ titudes , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects can be explained in details .
invites a project tool bar . these are stored in the project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens up a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be stored using settings actions or are asked to store the tool@@ bars , whether you want to store the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool bar from the visible range . this does not extingu@@ ish them from the hard disk . if you have not stored the tool@@ bar , you will ask if you want to do this .
this allows you to send their own tool bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team , so the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu entry will open a new email message with the tool bar .
allows to upload tool bars on the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or anything else has done and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
loading / re@@ loading of the entities from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; DT@@ EP exists ; if this is global and an write permission in the global K@@ DE file fails , the shop fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently charged tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current day evaluation dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insert of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . smart input means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us may be refused to add the tool to this place .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the listed menu points . click to click on . click on the activate plug@@ ins disabled .
choose syn@@ dic@@ ation mode for the current file . the list of available utility schem@@ ata depends on der@@ af@@ ate ; -@@ version .
select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D option ; by external use Ti@@ dy .
immediate shut@@ down between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . it is recommended that the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains a entry for each open window . with a selection of an agreement , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
sh@@ uts the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main sequence on or off .
the changes in this dialogue contain any application that use the HTML Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web brow@@ sers .
address the behavior of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ er . in the Docum@@ entation of &amp; Kate , you can find details .
a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or add what can be done and the sequence will follow .
this should produce an aid according to the mouse poin@@ ter &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled in the best from top to bottom , as for example , after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project automatically complet@@ es . all these paths and author information fields can be stopped later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . in the input of name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you are processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ com@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log file will be used . depending on the remote computer adjustment it could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this file should be set rather than standard .
this is the file , where the tool bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this file should be set rather than standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or whole files can be selected .
this attitude is great , if you have static web content you want to download and change . if scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
accused , if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project are supposed to be integrated . if a project is started to re @-@ start , do not ha@@ ze .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of vou@@ chers .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files through an@@ cho@@ ke or , by removing the ring , from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be instantly upload with project properties in the menu frame in the menu window , or using the SH@@ IFT Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings are in the project assistant and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which will be newly modified for project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
supplem@@ entary option to top , including files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project prospects .
in order to be selected the desired de@@ bug@@ gers . currently , only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin can be set with the button options . in case the trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting is described .
in the bottom window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) may be set as well as the display of a building @-@ view for the content of the server for each profile , setting a separate construction view for each profile .
in the Team window configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the sub @-@ window event configuration , event events can turn @-@ off and add these actions , change or er@@ ase . event actions are carried out if a certain event occurs , such as the sick@@ nesses of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . you can not influence this behavior .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar . the dialog can open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us will be closed , the project file will be stored automatically . you will ask if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project .
project management provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be stored in the current project .
folders behave similarly , but are missing the entries to open and open ... in the right mouse button , open @-@ text menu :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information on the site of highly ad@@ missible files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent removing the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten . this option is useful if frequent upload files is necessary , and the rather uns@@ afe password of the record -@@ option is not in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog , if you change your opinion in front of the upload .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . to edit or creating a profile , this dialogue will be displayed :
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
port for transfer . usually this must not be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it to your discre@@ tion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but each with programming language can be easily seen in the plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple num@@ b of view , various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened in the menu , or the project tool bar , accessible via the tool@@ bars project tool bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in their own working mode .
as mentioned above , the tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; at best about the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding diff@@ ers . adding tool@@ bars is treated in the section Add work@@ places .
the tool bars and symbols can be set either via the context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which you can remove other actions such as tool bar , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be implemented , which will be visible in the dialog , which actions on this or other tool bars are to be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , in addition the entries will remove and action performed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up on them in the menu with tool@@ bars ... and set the settings ... .
templates are contained in the essential documentation , code escal@@ op@@ es and files . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any most common file system with extended organisation and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system existing directory in the storage space . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their application . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using lin@@ ings ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the storage space under global templates . for more information on the templates is available .
documents can be made from any text documentation . on the basis of this templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple sc@@ aff@@ old for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate manner to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage space under global templates . see for more information on the templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted into documents . you can find everything from a comment via a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl based . some examples are found in the storage space under global templates . see for more information on the templates .
as the name says , this templates for all the sites are templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , together in a compressed tar Archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
design a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as a template as a local template .
once this is done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the project tree under project management .
select text in your document and click File as a template to save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and print on the construction @-@ view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file only can copy into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for use , such as pulling and disman@@ t@@ ling or insert the file @-@ tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a file right in the file @-@ tree or in the project files Bau@@ man@@ views on a folder right and secure site template , select a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be saved in the project file , but of course it can be saved as a local or global model .
project developers enable a highly @-@ oriented approach to date . you can add head lines and foot@@ lines or connect dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; in addition , you can insert some things when using templates in projects very deep in mind .
the template structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files set in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / merge / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates / template / template / template or templates . each of these folders equals one of four types of containers such as above .
to specify the behavior of an folder , click the folder overview of the folder and select the text menu properties tab . the following dialog appears :
a select field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blind@@ ed , once el@@ ter@@ istic attributes can be disputed .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts for everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able , unless they appear explicitly . in case of a normal folder the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text structures . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a regular folder .
allowed text or recre@@ ated text for templates in this folder . this might be general head@@ line or foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project and allows copying contents of contents into a folder with special head@@ line / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ line / foot@@ er lines .
in addition , you have a text menu ( to show the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be reached via the menu view . the first mode will replace the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editing functions as follows : he loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and cur@@ sor will appear . then you can edit and when needed to the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL can be displayed in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editing on a document that &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ sion of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to change the source editor . there are no plans to change these behavi@@ our@@ ings .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that the changes are displayed both in the source code and in V@@ PL . editor synchron@@ ous . with pressures of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , this mode is already active , the button transfer the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , whereby the position is kept in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ ant@@ a .... It can be set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendations can be set . in principle , the recommendation is required : a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags is possible at work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called upon as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editing is used to change the hanging of the hanging body . this is how to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information on the document themselves , i.e. , bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. key words on the column name and key word key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the creation of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with buttons under the list or er@@ ase . a change about the list is possible , just as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the adap@@ tion of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert an external CSS styl@@ ing template by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ sors is like in a word word , due to the arrows , possible . in rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor position is pec@@ uli@@ ar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and delete a distance or distance .
inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way over the tool@@ bars , such as in the source code editor , and it is said to consider that the inser@@ tion of tags have already existing identical tags , e.g. an anchor tag , is surrounded by text , each other surro@@ unds an anchor tag must be removed .
some tool bars like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; will be used in this release the tables or lists tool bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining styles of style . in contrast to other programs for styl@@ ing systems , search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the styles can be followed .

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ ing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes , and at the same time it correc@@ ts a lot of changes at the same time . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within this lines . and there was no clu@@ es on the places where perhaps only the re@@ mun@@ eration was changed . the merger of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences in line and changes to white characters . later , lots of further useful functions were added .
if you would like to compare text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function which made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful if two people can work independently from each other than one piece of co@@ des and make changes . the original file ( the basis ) helps to edit both correct changes . in this Editor , you can also edit the results directly . in this Editor , you can also edit the result even directly . the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell files in merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and mer@@ ging complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and user interface to the options of current colour monitors . if you often need to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no anno@@ y@@ ance if anyone changes the re@@ mun@@ eration . )
if a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes in one line , then the colour indicates that the file varies . red color means that both files differ .
if all files are the same names , but in different folders , you can facilitate the ti@@ p@@ ments by using only the file names of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder , folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder
the opening dialog allows manual en@@ coding of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last @-@ opened file from the folding list . the opening dialogue will give you a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be carried out .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , you will use the same or merge folders . if you select a file , it is used for B and C but use a file , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active for the target and can be done . however , it is not necessarily necessary to establish an output file immediately . you can do this step later during stores .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set the options before you start with the default / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board in the active compar@@ ative window . compared to opening dialogue , you don &apos;t have to select files , you can simply complete the dialog with the break button .
you can also use pulling and disman@@ t@@ ling : simply drag a file from one file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall on a comparison window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you would like to find out how similar these functions are , it would be quite a relatively large effort . you would need to load two corresponding files , and then compare it . now you can copy the relevant sections simply , add and then compare .
note : currently you can draw nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only release text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and placing text into another program as cutting and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such a case your original data could go lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and line number of the first visible row in the window . ( if the path is too long , leave the mouse to rest for a while . then , a small relief window will show the full name . )
the three springs are the letters A , B and C are assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default may be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , one sees in the color that distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the colour scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good .
left next to the text is the summar@@ izing column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding colour . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processors and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the combination column from the text , is interrupted in the digits , where the case file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is shown on broken lines .
the results window ( under the comparison list ) also has a info @-@ line with the inscription : , the file name and &#91; changes &#93; if you have the results . usually it contains text , but often contains conflicts .
! ! ! up to all conflicts are dis@@ b@@ anded , the store is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to execute the most solved / un@@ resolved conflict around the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed in all windows , where the group will not be visible . ) This group will then produce the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and each on the left is a black beams .
sometimes , through the automatic merge or by manual processing , no further line remains in the group ; then it will be displayed in these lines of text &amp; lt ; no row in the qu@@ el@@ iness . this text will not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may copy and add wo@@ different .
the text &amp; lt ; Con@@ duction @-@ fol@@ lic@@ ates ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the results window . go carefully with this function .
note : when choosing the sources to ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + Comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly to the mouse running and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can also use the arrow keys to the right , right , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and C@@ tr@@ l finish , si@@ w as well as you can also use it from other programs . by clicking on , you can also click here to navigate .
in the eye @-@ window , you can also use the other keys to edit . you can switch between insert and transfer mode . ( default setting is insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button , synchron@@ izes the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group ( as already explained in the section ) and the edi@@ table window window was declared .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Image upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Image ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , all un@@ dissolved conflicts are still considered to be a conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the marking in the cli@@ p@@ board , you have to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . if this is enabled , you will be copied automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board and copy the manual copying . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the content of the cli@@ p@@ board acci@@ dentally .
line breaks are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . UNIX variants use a line @-@ in delay \ \ r \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and re@@ produced during the next start . ( menu setup - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a script with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides writings with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
when you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c writings . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be framed . in these systems , the button pre@@ ferences automatically displays an odd colour .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator button . otherwise , there is a tab@@ ulator sign .
if you press input or Return , the backward line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be copied automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board is then de@@ activated .
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the usual selection on the operating system used .
when compar@@ ing files are tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines to the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . also , white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a car re@@ plen@@ ishment &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other again store only one line @-@ up character &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car @-@ back sign , but then you could be treated with different sizes on the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but if this option must be disabled , however , this option must be disabled . in default , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; . &apos; . &apos; , but they will be shown as white characters .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the Autom@@ ated mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before going to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
solves automatically all conflicts in white characters using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if you need to ignore it only from time to time , then use better the features W@@ ähle A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection can also ignore conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in chapters to scanning and merge and merge the merge . look for details under documentation on the directory and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already one such backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without any further backup .
adap@@ ting the language of the user interface . changing this option does not match the current program . you must quit and restart the change . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally through the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting is used for all entries .
via the radio fields for the en@@ coding , a short notice what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file code for source files . this influences how special characters can be treated and interpreted as the code for each file is individually adjustable , can compare files with different coding and be merged .
if you have edited a file , you can define what co@@ en@@ coding should be used for saving .
if you define output commands , they might not be able to function with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the processing command can only use 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can define the coding of output command devices .
turn off to supp@@ ress the alter@@ ations of changes in white characters in the text or instructions . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a colour coded over@@ si@@ zing column . but sometimes you want to see only the differences between two of three files ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal even a second transi@@ tional column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen better for long rows . simply enter the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window . this can also be useful for displays of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide how to merge the files . current file merge and use the file name file as default . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . )
when reading a file it will be given first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own label processor , which is exactly your requirements . you can use this function e.g. for removing distur@@ bing parts or correction .
when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of command will be used only at the line . you can write your own label processor , which corresponds to your requirements . every input line must have a corresponding edition line .
the idea behind it is to enable the user to enable more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program needs to program , and most users don &apos;t want to program that . good news is , however , in most cases sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command to convert the input into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other version control systems use a few key words to automatically add character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . therefore , the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with sed experim@@ enting , you may begin to understand and perhaps you may like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignore of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line compensation . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each one hit , and each item is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several ar@@ dis@@ courses at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the reactions from each other . example :
instead of sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e -@@ e -@@ s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are different from per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; .
the data according to normal pre @-@ processor are maintained for viewing and merge . the further operations change the data that the line @-@ off Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line @-@ of @-@ pre@@ processors can be used as input from normal pre@@ processors as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences may be hidden , you acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and destroying important data in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and merge .
... making a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the suggestion forward ,
... can simul@@ ate the merge and shows the simul@@ ated changes without them really perform ,
... requires selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you need to file only folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three files are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no target file is specified , file specified &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target file .
note that only the comparison of folders will not start the merge . to start the merge , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow ) .
while reading the folder you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress . if you stop scanning the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and any folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the button or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions , open all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
when you click on a file , the file is started and it appears a compar@@ ative window .
the icon in column Name reflects the file type in the first file ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation can not be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as seen in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C , colors red , green , yellow and black are used .
for identical entries , the colour is identical , even if the number of entries is different .
folders are considered the same as the same content is identical . then , folders are the same color . in folders , the age is irrelevant in its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colours of a sheet again , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , extingu@@ ishing the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , extingu@@ ishing the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , extingu@@ ishing the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B have not have the same file type ( e.g. when A folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ize mode is active if only two files and no explic@@ it target file were specified , and if the option will synchron@@ ize directories . then , choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that the two folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; copied directly after the merge , copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two files are merged , then select the new file instead of merge ( un@@ secure ) , then check the correct file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange are not eliminated , the merge may not be started .
during the merge , one file is working according to the other . it status column shows fer@@ tig when the merge was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected can be completed , you should check out a final review and see if the status is al@@ right everywhere .
if set up the file compar@@ ative method Full analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 will show further columns . these include the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts is displayed only when three files are compared or merged . )
you can merge either the selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have chosen all together @-@ sensitive actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the merge .
please note : if you have no target file , then in the three @-@ file @-@ merge mode , C will be used as target , when using two @-@ folder mer@@ ging , B and / or B is used as target .
if you have chosen a target file , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target file , even in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped through certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to put all the entries : select directories and start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to run only the current entry : select support of the current El@@ ements or press F@@ 6 .
if using conflic@@ ting data types still invali@@ d inter@@ actions , a message appears on the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action .
when you summar@@ ize all entries , a dialogue window with the options run , simul@@ ate and break .
select Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without the real changes . you will then receive an exhaus@@ tive list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens . ( please note the screenshot ) .
if you are done with a file , select again directories , proceed or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; check out a mistake , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you choose the cause of the problem . so you have the opportunity to select another action for the entry , or proceed to the problem , before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries were individually merged , these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them to the future together . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be done as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called on @-@ line merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the elem@@ ental tree . it can be entered several patterns . separate space holders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default * . folders don &apos;t have to match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a partition . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a partition . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ignore files that will also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this file can be specified using a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have an acci@@ d attribute . in other file systems , a pre@@ defined point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
in links to folders : if the option is switched off , the links like normal files are dealt and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible rec@@ ur@@ ts ) , a link to the link to itself would lead to a final loop and crash@@ es off . ) This option is switched off in default .
a complete analysis of any file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ ob@@ atic , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files , which contains no text . ( specify a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folder on a slow network , it may be faster to compare the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security . please be careful with caution . this option is removed from default .
similar to confidence of change date . there is no real comparison . these files are considered the same as the same . that can be useful when copying the change date . please be careful with caution . this option is removed from default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two files are compared and no target file is specified . in this mode the proposals are so selected that afterwards both folders are identical . this option is stored in both folders . this option is set off in default .
if there are differences instead , instead of merge the copying of the newer file as action . ( this will be considered uncertain because the other file is not changed , you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or a file is replaced by another or deleted , the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file is already exists , this will also be deleted without another backup . this also applies to the normal connection of single files , not only the merge of the file . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder @-@ merge view@@ points are visible to the merge of single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window divi@@ der on the window menu and switch to change between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . however , in the directory menu you can also merge a single file , without the folder , use the file , and the file will not be handled once more , if you run the folder together .
however , this status goes lost if you want to read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of Ki@@ o @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file using a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a file within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . some things you should consider :
a path can be relatively und@@ one . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special signs have to be m@@ ashed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes , due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or a folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change @-@ date . hence , soak the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( please note the option of trust in size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main reason for use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button about the difference viewer and then choose In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , it takes up &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , the program patch starts to restore the missing file .
in the quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the pop @-@ text preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing two files , a very small tool bar and menu . it does not support the merge or the same file sharing mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it is com@@ ender ) already exists . furthermore the name K@@ diff@@ 3 is already pointing out that it can merge how the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GP@@ L programs already very long and have learned a lot by using in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers that are gone or going to go so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and should not find the right PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . in the default , you can &apos;t find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters different is different , these lines are first treated as the same ; but if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines for next to Each other , this is the case this is often the case .
the editor is noticeable for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . that &apos;s necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C , and it &apos;s too much effort to design extra a file format that could store these information .
the effort for this was too large so far . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit a larger quantities on text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; released and the text cannot er@@ ase . what does it mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already many colors are used to empha@@ size differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 functions , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
information you can use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3 sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; install on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir is the file installed in your system where the K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no problems with comp@@ ile . if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or switch @-@ removing ) into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or switch @-@ insert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current curve position and replaces the current marking .
only differences are shown : files identical in all folders are not included in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target file .
( in the current program version you must review the folder the folder with the function Update . )
there are only entries shown that these files are not included in the target file . if the target file does not contain these files , they are missing after the merger . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons on selecting the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the appropriate window are attached to the end of the selected group ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual working areas . it is quite practical to change the ongoing programs on the working areas to change their size , or move it . this works both within a desk and with multiple .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual environments as well as the applications running . applications can be selected and even moves on your desktop .
with the medium mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . the movement is possible both within a desk and other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click on the application and the use of application as well as entries , maxim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize your desktop and finish . the commands will affect the following commands :
maxim@@ izes the application window on full size of mind . only appears when it was cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to select virtual desktop . only appears when it was cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check@@ box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; it can be moved with the middle laying on your desktop and also to other working areas .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the name of virtual work space is displayed .
cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work space is shown . if it is enabled , together with name , the names will be marked with ordin@@ ances , &amp; eg ; 1 . mind .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ space is displayed to enable their selection .
the view of the program window is selected here . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its standard symbol and pixels . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in some other Windows managers , all virtual work@@ areas in a horizontal and vertical range of applications can be seen in a vertical range , which is very good for the presentation of the side on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ range in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can change in size that can display windows as symbols or with their content , and can also move outside the control panel .
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select the switch settings ... allows the dialog box to appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog box .@@ You can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you have no write permission for the file , you must register the keys of wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and refer to this value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen link . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; part of the screen size , so you would like to read a micro@@ scope for small print or the precise viewing of a photo . this includes artists , web designers and people with a vision . this documentation should be a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding around new features . it is optim@@ ised for use on high performance machines .
if you &amp; co may start , a window appears as top . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; this window displays the enlarged area of screen . in the following , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fying window . in the following is an enlarged range of screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
in the default setting increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving lung . alternatively , you can set a selected screen range in the magni@@ fying window ( selection selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the screen ( eg ; on the left ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter , this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the box window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrows and mouse button and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can shift the content of the magni@@ fying glass and move . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you add the &amp; Shift button ; press the button or the M@@ MB ; use the button window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the radio button remain firm , and only the bottom right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer , copy into a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts or stops the up@@ dating of the display . the stops of up@@ dating causes the necessary CPU time to 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very small , straight , means , high , very high ) . the higher the Update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will appear . the selected area is displayed in one window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your created short@@ commands to store files , opening up a new window , printing , new@@ comer ( with the button document re@@ loading in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and milling &amp; etc .
may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen link . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; for this purpose you can use a micro@@ scope to view the small printed in a paper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefit : from research or artist to web designer or vis@@ ually han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click , once the mouse pointing a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive strain @-@ inhal@@ ation syndrome ) and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick sore pain@@ s .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click , once the mouse pointing a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people suffering the re@@ peti@@ tive strain In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and that each mou@@ sec@@ lick sore pain@@ s . this also requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can handle the pain that emerg@@ es by clicking the mouse , and helps to use so many people to assemble the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may seek pain using the use of your computer , you should see a doctor if this is not done yet .
in order to clari@@ fy it even more : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should avoid pain that are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the use of mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all the ergonomic aid : the result may vary for each differently .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click immediately when you break the movement short .
is the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is em@@ ulated the mouse button . in this way , you can execute the pulling of the bri@@ d@@ led mouse button . the smart shift requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly .
after the end of the mouse movement , it must be enough , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to execute a mouse click .
if it is enabled , the turn@@ around is switched on ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting , before the mouse button is waiting until there is no evidence of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now is activated by clicking on the mouse button . this function is activated , followed by a break , a click with the right button . these movements will be stored in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt file when the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can reduce the reaction time to reduce the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the tab . there is a sliding sound buffer , which you can set on a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only available under &amp; K@@ DE ; please insert the respective documentation to determine how you start a program automatically .
set all settings back to the values , which have been discontinued when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button user , the settings are reset to the user &apos;s final pressing .
at best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with default settings . in particular , you should first use the intelligent shift to start off . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you &apos;ll later be able to push the smart move .
if you are using the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times by &amp; K@@ DE ; for shut@@ ters .
first of all , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect remains : the click on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that doesn &apos;t pose a link does not lead to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can therefore use mouse in such places , until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is printed , you should clean your mouse . this is normally rather simple . the trick is that you do not only cleanse the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse .
first of all , you need to take out the mouse ball . as that happens , mouse becomes different from mouse to mouse , but it should be quickly clear when you view the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the sphere , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole where the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or fing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you &apos;re just a move forward , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean that the operation can no longer end by the letting go .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and post@@ p@@ one window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this is reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another spot .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor place where you want to have it . but do not use the mouse on a neutral area of mind , if you are using a key moments . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover lines of windows .
I try to work with smart moving , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent shift is a more advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it , to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and want to add any other action at which you will probably cause some problems . here are some advice :
do not use the intelligent distor@@ tion , if you just begin to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to use . select text instead as follows : take a mouse click to the other end of the text and keep the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always be played every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . the mouse button fl@@ ushes the sound like a mouse click . so you can also use the smart re@@ loc@@ ating without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it needs some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case in most cases .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available if the system has a sound card and loud@@ speaker , and set it correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , actu@@ ated the mouse button shortly after the mouse poin@@ ter shortly . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and those who prepare the beg@@ inner pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting that a pulling process begins , before the mouse button is let loose . in this way the pulling and disman@@ t@@ ling can be carried out with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can talk to their computer with the dum@@ my user .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can talk to the computer for themselves . the user can choose a list using the conversation sentences , which should be spoken once again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left ) , give the command , which later is used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the dialog .
on the second side you choose the standard text pass@@ age@@ book . from the text pass@@ ag@@ les you can often choose passages , without having to type . the text box can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screen photo ) you specify the dictionary for the word direction . &amp; k@@ mouth , read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can read the word lists using a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary . in addition , you can only spell the word of words into the Wor@@ lds .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly evident and contains essentially an input field for keys of your sets ( the lower white field in screen ) and a le@@ ak memory of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in screen ) .
if you k@@ mouth ; properly set up , you can enter the sets of sentences you want to hear . every spoken set will be attached to the run memory . you can select phr@@ ases that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialogue includes two card cards , speech output and settings , page Wor@@ lds , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card game , give the command to call the language . in the box below the input field , you specify the character code , with the text on the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . select the check@@ box when the text remains unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check@@ box is not selected , the text will continue as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to voice your language generator depends . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples are found in the App@@ endi@@ x .
using Pos@@ sible Dic@@ t@@ d as language service , &amp; k@@ mouth is going to pass on this site . if that is successful , the further settings are available on this site . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is available and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection of action according to the selection of a text passage you determine which action caused by the keyboard or by choosing a text passage in the text box book or in the box for text matching seeds is triggered .
with the selection of sol@@ fort , the chosen text passage is directly spoken , and added in addition to the input field . selecting in the input field the chosen text passage is entered first only in the input field .
with the second selection box , the edit service manual for Text@@ pass@@ agen@@ buch , you can set whether the textbook is to automatically be saved when switching the editing window .
to save the text file box , the book is stored . if you dis@@ card changes , the textbook is not stored . select Before Save , will ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the textbook is to be stored .
the site Wor@@ ter@@ istics contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ lds . in the main window in addition to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a select field where this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field you can choose the currently used dictionary to rule .
with the buttons on the right on the page you can delete their dic@@ tion@@ aries or export the order of books or export them into a file . below the list you can adjust the language in the input field and select the language for the dictionary .
choose for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by re@@ count of occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the vocabulary containing Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert the written words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to summar@@ ize the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these weights are to be made .
with this option , you can lay a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; restart automatically into the dictionary , generate a dictionary with your vocabulary during the time .
the main area of the window for processing text pass@@ ag@@ les is divided into two . in the upper part , the text matching seeds are represented as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the related key root , you can only change its name .
actions such as new passages or books add or select text box and books can be made either via the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar , or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text pass@@ ag@@ les or text box can be changed by pulling the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key change .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected areas of publishing .
the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected areas of publishing .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text in the input field is located , it will be used otherwise the selected movements of run memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a shifting tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands are displayed . by default , the tool bar is arranged directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the nar@@ rowed left side and pulling the tool@@ bars can be moved to another position .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow base in the bottom part of the main sequence with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not specified , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sus@@ pen@@ able glue is displayed directly under the editing window directly under the tool bar . by mouse click on the nar@@ rowed left side and pulling the tool@@ bars can be moved to another position .
probably you have the command for the speech output not correct or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General Settings and enter the command for the language issue on the card output . ( see setup dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
the festival is a language issue of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ z are supported . the license allows to use the festival free to use festival free and re@@ distribute without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that festival in the / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to the language output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an online language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and transmit it without restrictions .
for example , to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language issue , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ iter folder . the speech output is then possible with one of the three command examples :
for the third example , the option must send data as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in ph@@ on@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax would like to send the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be requested . therefore , the complete command is more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la -@@ e / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la -@@ e / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la -@@ e / usr / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ sh@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ;
all parts of the command must be written into one line . option data must be switched on as standard input .
the language issue of speech on &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ more language service , the all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ uses a standard interface for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language issue systems .
since the language of the language can only be done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just have to use Pos@@ sible Dic@@ t@@ d as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setting the K@@ TT@@ SD speech , which appears in the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on each computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t talk to people who can &apos;t talk to the text by the calcul@@ ator . it is stored a list already stored sets , which can be rest@@ art@@ ed and rest@@ art@@ ed the user again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer appears . on the computer , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL to the address bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the language issue system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is a set of modules existing on each application , which allows each application to read text on the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for speech output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a joint application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . also , the users are offering interesting opportunities .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications are embedded .
the speech output is performed by the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the generation of language versions on the command line ( or with Shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
in the future : support for speech @-@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; speech @-@ up language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech @-@ up @-@ met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the speech output of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; bus ; offer .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d on kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
one module for the web browser &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or sharing .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially read .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa @-@ Database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find the list on htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ one / list@@ info / K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essibility . you can also find the developer in the IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essibility ) .
before you use &amp; kt@@ ats ; you need to install programme speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and adjust correctly . see also
when you are set up on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no spokes@@ man is set , the map speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set at least one speaker , the map displays are displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer provide various languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that describes itself in volume or speed . you can also set multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer ; you should at least use a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher used the standard speaker .
different speaker for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several users for the same printer .
if you click on the map @-@ shaped speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the map of the map will be displayed automatically , when you launch a kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not a speaker is set up .
all actors already appear in this list . the preferred actors appear above in the list . the most common spokes@@ man will be used for the speech output if there is no speaker .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
in a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker into the list below . the sequence of the actors in the list definitely will be its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ System apply .
select a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a youth and girl agree .
if you click here , the new spokes@@ man will appear on the map of the map . to change the settings of this talk , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost . go back to the card and check if your language issue is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language version of &amp; K@@ DE . click on the card card to open this card card . here you can set some general options here .
mark the check@@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ats ; this starts successfully , and you can create text orders . see . remove the marking , will pause K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System from &amp; K@@ DE will be disabled .
when dict@@ at@@ m@@ gr is finished , it runs ; continue , if the field output file is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed .
if this check@@ box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control panel , it dis@@ appears once the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this row , you can start text orders , stop , hold and record .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ cli@@ p@@ board template or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings on all sides will be taken over .
the order ticket orders will be displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card @-@ card and cross your voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can check the text of the displayed web page . check out the text that should be read , and select the text in the Main Menu . after short time the speech output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML will also be read too .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor by &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the displayed text . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run then . check the text that should be read , and select the text file in the Main Menu . then , the language issue should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE ; that you will notify about you established events . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts ; read more
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE , you can submit various kinds of messages . for example , you can submit a message when your nick@@ name is coming . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the menu settings . these are possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy depending on application .
filters for the character generation provide a good option in &amp; kt@@ ats ; in@@ correctly stressed or faulty messages . it removes the tags b@@ r and b out of the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , because this can be assumed in most cases considered to be assumed . read also .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
in filtering it will be edited , before he is sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to select wrong words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a matching language and speaker , or to avoid certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other records and keep these orders . if the issue of screen Reader is read , orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and holds the output from messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
News have the next shelf priority . one news inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the news . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you just enter the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Noti@@ fication are also news . read more
the rest are simple text orders . every order that you add from the card orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that apply text orders . text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts that do not have special ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , except the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such pre@@ reads , this issue will stop and termin@@ ate .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ aders . they are applied on normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News .
filters work the text and put it on the next filter . at the time there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there can still be further types of filters .
character strings replace parts of a text by other text . you can replace them either as words or as regular expressions . it will be printed with pre @-@ defined text ratings such as : - ) through text or for the transformation of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former uses a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speaking selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that sent the text on &amp; kt@@ ats ; for example , if you have set up a female voice on the map of the map , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it .
each of these various filter has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter does not apply that its rules does not apply , he will continue the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; alert on &amp; kt@@ ats ; sent , it will be mach@@ ined by all activated filters , which have been set up on the page below . editing is carried out in order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be switched from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ ters , and it will be displayed next below .
enter a list of words or regular expressions then you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions . will this pattern be exchanged in text , then the text will be exchanged against the associated spare text . large and small sample is considered compared to comparison .
specify a name for your filter . you can choose from this name , it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string from the column . the list is checked in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expressions in the list .
with these buttons you can upload a list of words or regular expressions out of a file , save the current list or delete a list from one file , the entries will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker for the text job offers one of the languages registered here . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also hold multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can input several programs separately by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the applic@@ ability ID run programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be we@@ dge . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ator ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 will only be set .
the coll@@ ision filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ room filter if equal . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the text file protection filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ s. The words must therefore be limited by separation symbols ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; button &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; button &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; you &apos;ll find phr@@ ases in am@@ big@@ u@@ ine package .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such modifications . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the spokesperson filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the map speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . you can indicate that text from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter is searching for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties that selected the program , sending the text on &amp; kt@@ ats ; with the speaker &apos;s speaker , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is used if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions are installed , you can call this button on the button to get assistance with the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string chain , i.e. , you start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
check here the properties of the item you want . if the text meets the above @-@ shown filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which correspond to the desired requirements . click on the button to the right to display the dialog .
use these buttons to store or upload your application settings or delete all the settings .
the appointed filter is applied only in the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ room filter if applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
the language issue API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; with the programmer can give your applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section includes a brief description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the language issue API of &amp; K@@ DE ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essibility site ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for language output via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; by program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Speech .
here is text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are still more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands give you
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ window . just start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ form@@ ul@@ er@@ filter set up , but when using the module &apos;s module , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone that S@@ able does not work at all . you must also do that if you do not need this voice to read websites , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or interventions appear to cause mistakes to syn@@ thesizer , so that all pro@@ positions ski@@ pped or only cow@@ ards . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the option is set on the right value for the respective language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , you may possibly be rec@@ tified by a string of character filters . see .

the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , please refer to the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the site of kt@@ ts ; according to information which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ tive module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of any other syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , sit with the Develop@@ er team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs package and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source codes of &amp; kt@@ ats ; from the source code , you have downloaded , translate , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ats ; please check first if the speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . this allows you to use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts that uses the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr should be so enhanced that the creation of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the SPD does not need any more .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sets . the user can go back @-@ - or ab@@ dic@@ ally back , repeat the output or break down .
when applying text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , you can request the properties of the preferred microphone for the output . if you want to use a speaker , it will be used automatically , otherwise the best speaker will be selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , choose a speaker , see you in .
if you click on the map of the map to add or edit a speaker into the list , the map of map speaker is displayed . as an example , the map of the module for Festival Interactive will be displayed . details of the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . when the path to the festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you have to enter the festival .
select the text en@@ coding for text that will be handed over to the festival . in general , this attitude will be done automatically . generally applicable , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you adjust volume , speaker vel@@ ocity and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controllers , and this gray can be displayed , you cannot choose the voice chosen from you .
some voices such as multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds because of their size . if you are checking the check@@ box , these voices will already be charged with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first movement is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check@@ box cannot be selected , you haven &apos;t set any spokes@@ man ( or forget to apply ) . see .
if this check@@ box is marked , the program window is shown at the launch of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to show the program window .
if this check@@ box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop or to control them .
here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application , the current status of the application , the number of pro@@ positions and just working sentence . the speaker ID is equivalent to the column ID on the map speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can choose sat@@ s@@ ise in the order , which is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text orders are performed and ad@@ ministr@@ ated . issues from screen re@@ els , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
choose the type of audio output . if a component does not be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if g@@ amer or a@@ code for the audio output is to be used , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you &apos;ll need to install at least one module . if you have AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also
put the term speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equ@@ ates to about half and 200@@ bsp ; % roughly the double standard radio speed . thus , these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X has to be installed .
click Apply to Apply the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ats ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA machines includes all PCM devices and modules , which are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
on this card card , you can set particular promotions that will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language contracts :
the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it is drawn to all other records and holds the orders . after the issue of screen Reader was read , the orders received are resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor will be reserved for hot . a warning keeps the output from messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . one news inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web site , you can agree with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you just enter the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or copy of a screen @-@ reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both single @-@ conduc@@ tive sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound is played in front of the introduc@@ tory message .
settings on this card card only apply for regular text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and issues of screen re@@ els , there are no particular promotions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to be able to read &amp; kt@@ ats ; read kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the messages will be noti@@ fications .
mark this check@@ box to switch the pre @-@ read of &amp; K@@ DE ; noti@@ fications before . if this attitude is not selected , the other settings are disabled and pun@@ ctu@@ ality ; read no noti@@ fications before .
if this setting is marked , noti@@ fications by which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you want to select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; if someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nick@@ name .
all events , which is nothing else indicated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts will do if an event draws . you have the following selection options :
if you select custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the properties of the desired microphone . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if a certain event is specified for a specific application , this will be executed . otherwise , the action is defined for all other events of the specified application . otherwise , the action is to carry running under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button Save to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . the invited events will begin with the events in the list . if you want to begin with an empty list , click on delete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice control of voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . besides , brands for control of pron@@ unci@@ ation from the example . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice that is used at the SS@@ ML issue .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds submit text into individual sets . this can also be syn@@ thes@@ ized , as only the first proposition should be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . so you can also jump back or cancel , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support them directly .
here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , you can automatically add a pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter automatically . you can add its at@@ titudes to change or more pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter , but will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
at the sim@@ pl@@ est way , you will learn the setup of speaking selection . check the map selection again , change the speaker selection again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to have installed more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start to read faster with the fore@@ read , as only the first movement must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last a long time ,
you will then keep text orders on the order ticket orders or can stop , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it can &apos;t be switched off , just removed . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ positions and include a tab@@ ular sign ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the proposition bor@@ dering ( Tab@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) . note that the standard @-@ s@@ enti@@ ment detection filter keeps the drawing level .
S@@ BD filters never applied on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( s ) , war@@ nings , news , or the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter , you can re@@ sign this again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the map menu , you can over@@ write the application settings for application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on board map ) . in other words : there are no knowledge properties defined .
use of the matching microphone , which shows all characteristics of the speaker . if you do not delete the settings of the speaker , select &amp; dict@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from , which corresponds to the most originally set properties .
select the method for entering the desired speech characteristics by clicking on one of the select buttons .
choose the properties of the desired office . if this feature does not matter , do not give anything .
mark this check@@ box when the property should have priority from other features . you can also set multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor at the default value , this property is rarely used as priority . you might use this property rarely . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is ahead , if you know that a specific application form text in another language as the result of the working environment .
to use all the properties in the area , use the most likely to delete the following , click on the button button and then use on speaker , which correspond to the most below .
in this case , 0 is set for the last text job in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input number is required ) .

the audio output of AL@@ SA does not work when I play a text application , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : &apos; to open PCM .

I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use them at the festival but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ / vocals the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; in which you have found the voice to the developer .
on the card audio , there is a setting speed . that this works , the program SO@@ X is installed and can be connected via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive can offer a adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the talk speed will be ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read either the filter for conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are totally brave , change the .x@@ sl file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML de@@ formations filter , and set up the speaker vel@@ ocity .
I don &apos;t create that web pages are read with a female voice . I created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not work . so that festival is no error , the x@@ sl file carries the converting of SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a own character set filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer a two or go back . on the cart@@ on orders will appear , the order will consist of a sentence . what am I doing wrong ?

before you proceed , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer is correct . follow the instructions you &apos;ve received with the Syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speaker vel@@ ocity and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ats .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that will be shipped with festival . would you like to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations regarding the transmission .
this voice sets Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you must opt for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; lin@@ ux ; distri@@ butions are included in the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the code must be termin@@ ated on an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used jointly with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival the le@@ x@@ ik@@ y analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; this produces the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; no complete language requirement is . &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows management of network interfaces , ro@@ uting and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop adjustments on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; it is displayed on the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not install . physical devices and their drivers have already been working and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device even displays and enables the setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices with installing and Linux ; installed and installed . will network appliances added later , the drivers will need to be loaded using the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Settings module is loaded if the network settings are selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Index settings are selected , while the module &apos;s starting system is trying to automatically detect the platform used on the system automatically .
if the platform can &apos;t be detected , the hanging selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and best . by checking the setting non @-@ re @-@ issues can be set permanently . during the next start of the network settings , then this selection will be pre@@ set automatically .
changing the network settings can only be displayed in system administration mode . previously , all settings are displayed , changing is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter the button management mode at the right end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the module &apos;s entire functionality is available in system administration mode . it is divided into three riders :
the device network interface functions for the administration of the system network . all available network devices are displayed . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks are implemented :
the settings specified network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button and click on the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the click of Advanced Settings displays dialogue with further possibilities .
with the selection Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information system sends all the required TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be carried out the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask is fixed .
if this option is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface in boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . using an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine whether the required address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . switching from a network device is done by selecting from the list and click on Interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off . turn off a activated network device through selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
sets the IP address of the host in local sub@@ net which is convey@@ ed by the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the web in which the gateway computer is located .
a calcul@@ ator with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer code htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS trig@@ gers this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator on the nam@@ ing solution part of the Reit@@ er@@ equ@@ ator solution enables simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .@@ DNS entries can be sorted by selecting a single application and lowering gra@@ dation in the list with buttons or her@@ ding in the priority .
adding the button to add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialogue New nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the button Edit .... It will edit the dialog box .
the list of well @-@ known hosts describes host name @-@ to @-@ IP address files for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats if no DNS servers are available . in small , enclosed networks can replace DNS servers .
normally the list of well @-@ known hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . this is still the same version of IP to replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer , and click Add .... The dialog can add new alias is displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the button . if the well @-@ known machine has multiple alias names , press the button add several times , and enter another alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer manufacturer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Know@@ ing Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings contained in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to enable the changes , the command needs to be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command needs to be removed .
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distribution ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm , as follows :
alternatively a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE does not satisfy , but additionally the development agenda with libraries and other things are required .
this is only recommended for users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile these commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given on fundamental network technology , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file may be discussed ; changeable configuration files .
this area may not replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the PC &apos;s integration are communic@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ sem@@ ination . IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future . this description is currently concent@@ rating on widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in other networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator the response position , which can be used as a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily .
when selecting a own little ( home ) network , IP address from a specially reserved area should be selected to avoid IP address accounts with the global ( Internet ) network . addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , hence its use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be possible through setting a gateway .
for smaller networks mostly addresses are used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route will be required for the IP finishing line .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . usually , the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 on an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files , which are specified by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file sometimes changed by DSL connections , so it is not surprised when there is no other content in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; SuSE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in sub @-@ config . another stand as expected can occur .

to activate or de@@ ac@@ ti@@ fy environment variable , select it , and place the condition with the menu Edit activation . if a de@@ activated variable appears under description .
alternatively , you can also click on the variable and select the right button . make sure that name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you have to store the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item Save .
alternatively , you may press C@@ tr@@ l ; S supp@@ ress changes or supplements to tasks or variables are then actively involved .
it appears the standard K@@ DE ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose out , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printing dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is accessible only for users to own advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xy @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SI@@ X con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a f@@ use program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it also offers the ability to create multiple archives on a band . the first goal was to answer a question for tar , which presented my wife : how much longer takes it when you secure ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; keep the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; if you don &apos;t know the band , you will be asked whether the band will be form@@ at@@ ted .
recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the credits are looking for the appropriate index on your record . cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be re@@ generated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol will change for the tape drive to indicate that the band is bound . in the Status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape .
before dis@@ card the ban@@ des , initially the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a change of the tool for the tape that the integration has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be kicked out without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat it can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band maps must be form@@ at@@ ted before you need to be used to store data . this process must not be form@@ at@@ ted before use , but it must be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; it is usually form@@ at@@ ted a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape ahead , DA@@ T drives not .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all data on the band will be lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process the band will be automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the edit files . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or file in the local file tree . it is saved only this file or the folder .
mark a f@@ use profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in local file @-@ tree with a h@@ unter . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be secured .
click the right button on the local file tree and select in the menus ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog can open up for backup . in this dialogue you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup .
once you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears to backup . the dialog shows the progress of the securing process , including data rate and the remaining time .
select one file or a folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is checked only the selected file or the folder .
select the files in one of the archives of the band with a her@@ ring . it is checked only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder .
click the right button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the testing procedure has been started , the dialog box for review . in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the verification for verification , the dialog appears to verify . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can use the re@@ produce , the files are to be restored , which can be restored to two types :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which include entry for tape drive . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a hem@@ at@@ meal . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are restored .
click the right button to create a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu ...
once the resum@@ ption process has been started , the dialog box appears for restoration . in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the file folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will restore the dialog . this dialogue shows the progress of recovery , as well as data through@@ put and remaining time .
sometimes it appears as necessary to re @-@ create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this process will delete all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of the band :
through this , a safety profile is created with the currently selected files and standard settings . you can make the following settings :
the current work folder , in which the backup should be carried out . the list of noti@@ fications is automatically updated according to the chosen work folder .
for all the files listed under the backup files , the files are listed on the same file system , such as the folder . file , which are on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . every entry will be viewed from tar regardless of the other .
to perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ ex@@ tual backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only the files are backed that have since changed since .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ ex@@ tual backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling from tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file is used for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; gt ; and lt ; LT ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device node for the tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape recorder .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is bound to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , &amp; k@@ dat is trying to lock up the throw at the band@@ age . maybe this setting does not work with all band@@ aging plants .
if the option is switched on , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band is exposed . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming .
if the option is switched on , &amp; k@@ dat is to change the hardware size for the tape drive . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to support &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band run .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one disk block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is machine name : seconds , whereby the host of the complete name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the band was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the period .
the band ID is used to find a file named in the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can manage themselves directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar ad@@ ministr@@ ating . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not include in@@ corporate f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup pattern . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the various protocol files . additionally , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users can access the quick access to information on problems related to their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer does in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , which cannot know where you can receive information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the various protocol files .
in addition , we enables &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users to provide quick access to information on problems related to their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide some extended functions that can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files for certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log has a number of useful functions . among others , this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ system@@ log functions ; functions are available , with their help to filter out the single protocol @-@ file easily and sort out . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual page .
after the start tries &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log , first the most important protocol @-@ file system - to open the system protocol , so you will not have a small message window , so you will not have Linux files usually in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually don &apos;t have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar , in order to filter out after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or after the log @-@ lines . in the default setting the box is displayed next to the filter line . then , a protocol line is displayed next to the filter line . then , a protocol @-@ line will be displayed only if in one of the columns contain the string search string .
you can also select another entry in this place . the string of the filter search term will then apply only with entries in accordance with selected columns , and apply in the filter bar the name of a process , so it shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a striking colour than protocol lines of level hint . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to show only certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to investigate the issue of a particular command , such as the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main menu to view all the next protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; enables the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage . once you select a sub@@ window , select a protocol display in the menu .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / link _ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. d@@ ort you will find more recent information on the reference sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in addition , you will find in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion Archive : ks@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system develops rapidly to standard for control of the system boots up at the high @-@ speed system in the Linux . world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and simultaneously more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( for example , because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to convert a machine on System V In@@ it without a new installation and new format . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder from / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service which you want to start on a different run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services does not include such things as set@@ serial , which will only be rest@@ art@@ ed . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be placed under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t have a lot of use . you can also want to run r@@ c.@@ / in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something that has to do with the serial connection .
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column , and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix / etc / in@@ lets by hand and change the 3 . be careful , then you will repair it by adding the system and execute the following :
but how does it take all the correct scripts ? if you enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , every entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts out by hand on the command line :
this would pause the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the one contains a K , the script will stop with the argument . if it includes an S , the script will start with the argument .
some people desire a simple way to establish machines for many purposes . I could go &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level , which can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; s@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could even run a user Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was set as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say not say tri@@ vial : just pull one entry from the area of available systems services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also change scripts between Run@@ lev@@ y or change the position within one level by changing it elsewhere . in this case , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this is not done if they pull out an entry from the area of available systems services .
note : entries will be moved when you move it into a new range . in order to copy them only to a new Run@@ level , you must select expressly copying from the menu Edit or select the context menu -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of this entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of existing entries before you can try again to include the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries which have been thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator key to enable the different working areas ( Available System services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous .
to post@@ p@@ one entry into another Run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually , press the button button to switch between different fields . join the dialog by re@@ pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are taken in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise it will be restored from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; alter@@ ations to the pre@@ ferences are stored in a local co@@ sy@@ r@@ c .
I &apos;ve been experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ ard , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
type on li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended to run Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way that system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simplified the configuration for the proprietary programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use a different distribution file : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) simply stop without a message when their configuration files are not connected or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; lin@@ ux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send us information about Run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adap@@ tion by &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry store file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user group and user group list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group characteristics .
some card cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only when you have extended system settings , you will be able to make individual settings . other cards appear if shadow passwords , or such as / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d installed in BSD uni@@ tions .
the password ticket password appears , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d installed as BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
this card card only appears , if for at least one embedded file system space limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable to the file system ratios user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , but the limited number of limitations in KB are :
these parameters may be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system .
the card details inform@@ s about the group @-@ level of selected users . the standard group , which is owned by the user , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Field . furthermore , the user can mark the user in other groups by clicking this in the big field .
the dialogue properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , check this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select from the menu User or Group , or click on the appropriate adding button of the tool bar . editing or delete the selected users or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ous .
with this module you can install the li@@ lo boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time until the boats of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
