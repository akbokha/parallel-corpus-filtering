<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated to the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations should not be dependent upon translations without checking the translation previously.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the internet can be translated. other texts should translate you to the Babelfish site itself, where you can add-to-start texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & Konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & Konqueror; by simply available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information on using & Konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual of & Konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & Konqueror; choose the extensions, select the card-card tools and select the desired modules here.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard configuration modules from the KDE package; Addons. please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package debase, the & Konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & Konqueror; click on extras. then you can view the page, the & Konqueror; to crash, or the list of stormy, if present, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module description (also called folder filters) you can reach in the & Konqueror; menu bar under Extras. with the module you can filter & Conqueror; 's current directory on different kind filters.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM tree view in & Konqueror; select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM which is currently displayed. as the default, the display starts with the root notes of document, example: documentelement, all other nodes are subelements of this root canal.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolism and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The particularity of & FSView; consists of clearly showing folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. every object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the size of the size of the subordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; reflected the size of a file or folder, the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries can be specified, even if they are easily detected in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView may be considered a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap-representation a rectangle, that represents a file or a file in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles of meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched on color mode, can be either depth for light detection of the depth depth or the image of any other file association such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various features of the file or folder. for each property, you can specify if enough space is displayed, only if there is enough space available to display any restrictions on the character of the Treemap). moreover, you can define the relative position of labelling in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example algorithmic algorithms should be observed that the surface is proportional to size the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this target will not always be kept. it will be drawn up in order to be lost in order to get the subordinate income. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As dividing the area of a entry for the subordinate entries, the implementation remains to be left. here, it is important for labelling and avoidance of space loss by frames always favourable to the areas that are square. the best methods of this matter are lines, columns, or recursive division healing.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimal representation area for an entry on the menu entry. instead, an aut√©ed pattern in the area of the orderly details will be drawn to indicate that this area is actually covered by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was originally designed as small testing application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widget designed for use KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & Konqueror; -Menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>

<seg id="57">Although & digicame; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills to use. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion with libraw, DNG-export and ICC colour management efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; via camera or lens that can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & KDE; programs is also & digicame; an open source project. that means it is based on the support of the end users. you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digial; try to make sense of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you use these linking menu, your web browser doesn't open a page in error coverage. all required information are already listed here. please follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicame; is a project supported by a community. i.e., users and developers are helping each other. if you are a regular user from & digicame; ask yourself any questions to other users of & digicame; however, you may soon talk about other users. in this mailinglist, however, you should be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digiplug; homepage to visit news about released versions and other information about & digicame; to experience.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digicame; to participate in the developer Mailing list. guide to report in the developer Mailing list of & digicame;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you & digicame; for the first time, you will ask where you want to save your pictures and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote file. enter the folder symbol for folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. this path is stored for all image files.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders such as you would like to add. & digicame; will also use the digiplug library in addition to the digiplug library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder, the images added as basic folder. & digicame; viewed every subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during the passage of the folder you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digicame; duro recursively recursively the librarian trail in its whole depth. you can't exclude subfolder, unless there's iste in hidden folder. you can do extradibs & digicame; do it by using a point before the name of the folder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as basic folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albends have no photos as symbols. you can change the albums by clicking on the folder symbol. this is then used as an album symbol. further details can be found in section albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digitization; your digital camera setup. after that you should learn how to use my albums and my keyword to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Rohdateisupport: if you use the raw mode of your camera, so & digicame; perhaps support is based on the libraf library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help resource support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up and work with the raw files is described in the sections of Roh-Decoderm and Roh-Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and support your photos directly in & digicame; albums of course. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and each card reader is supported by your operating system, with & digicame; working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are based on the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for the actual transmission to the computer, the camera will be implemented as a record-run. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug; uses the program gPhoto2 to communication with digital cameras, which has been developed and supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images of digital cameras for computers and other peripherals without the need additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calculator. since photos in general are large files and transfers about the serial port are slowly, this connection is now obsolete. & digicame; supports this cameras and leads the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found in this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be compiled with libexif support, so the EXIF support is required by some libgphoto2 camera drivers to read the thumbnails. if the EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2, you may possibly do the thumbnails for nothing or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digicame; is how easy to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI module: the KDE Image plugins Interface Project (manual) is a approach to develop a joint Modulstructure for & digicame;, KPhotoAlbum, Showigs and Gwenview. the aim is to provide modules for all graphics programs. the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can be a user. your advantage is that it's much easier to add & digicame; by writing a small module to complement a function as the changes in & digicame; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or change in full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Switches + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and put off pictures everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the Albenbaums, via the horizontal separatline or in another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be found in keywords, file list or searching.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file selection allows you to offset the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies, and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the fillet on the file name only appears when this ind the symbol view is displayed. which fields can be displayed in the dialog of AlbenSettings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; my Albenlibriquot; exhibits an organized view on your photo albums. these albums can be stored in a single albumtree, in which they were stored on the hard disk, in which the album was created first, sorted by the album first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">In case you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Imporal Pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Imporal Photo.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy a picture from an album to another album and move it, you can select the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there. in the then released menu you'll have to select whether the image is moving or copying or copy them. simply select all photos and move it to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the AlbumProperties give you information about this collection. to access the AlbumProperties, you have to select the right button on the album and edit nightclub features.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- collections: are a method to mark your albums that you can be grouped under a common name. if you want to add or delete new collections by collection. if you want to add new collections or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- date: is used if you sort of records after date with view records After date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons oldest, average, latest: this set the date on the date of the oldest, the latest image or the average of the album. it's first tries to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digicame; first picture will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; my Albenlibriquot; this will help you to remember the photos on the album. sometimes, the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; as Albumvorenquot; select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album may always be contained in a collection and collections can not be screwed up.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicame; supports the input of words for individual photos in the field of my recumbent list below. album collections have another effect. for the collection, you can use both photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>

<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by clicking either F4 Image Edit... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit your photos. in the section digivers; image editing you can view your photos and modify your photos and modify them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digicame; the functionality that you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the Context menu with the right mouse button, and how to adapt it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & KDE; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should consider that it can come after editing through other educational programs to problems with the image-containing metadata. some programs save this data not starting when you save the modified image. this makes this information lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicame; introduces two options to turn the speed. the easiest way to click on the preview and select filming. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can click the right button to preview and F2 renaming off the context menu. note that you have the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>

<seg id="108">If you select one month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the data sheet, so you can only select the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with photos provided a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cataloged. Tags are stickers, individual photos or entire groups can be assigned. once a keyword is assigned a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos that were selected by this keyword is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. you can also log your keywords logically. you can also fold the parts of the Baums & quot; My Cwordlistequot; so you can find the keywords that you are looking for, easy to find.</seg>
<seg id="112">The Tags are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the picture, at least for JPEG, saved. you can also use your keywords in other programs, as soon as digitization; the pictures noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on & quot; my keyword quot; or click on an existing keyword. if you have a new keyword, after you click on an existing keyword, this keyword will be found to the keyword.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you'll need to find longer a specific photo. if you don't know how many photos you have, then you don't want to save & digiplug;. the approach to store the metadata for both in a database and secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms, and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know you need to do something in your system. your image files should somehow be organized on your computer. you have to decide if you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you need to change some time on a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found fast over your location. if you have enough photos, then you will use sub-folders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% of the files will be and you will not want to organise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplified a backup strategy and migration. they will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option metadata to store in the installation page of metadata in & digial; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? that's how you want to change? that's a metadata Editor for a number of selected attribute. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real labour starts, as you should now choose to each photo. of course, you can choose all images that require the same attribute and then place the value. you will start best with the evaluation or order. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's leave us with keyword, key words, as you continue on other programs, or proceed categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import Catalogised pictures from a different source with embedded rectile, then & digicame; automatically create the tree for you to build on the pictures in the right place. changing the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by doing a subbaums on another. the changed keyword will be done by & digicame; updated while the subtrees are pursued.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows how different metadata is cut off. this is a very rough representation since each block consists of metadata in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool to catalogise your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to let most don't let your photos just see, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you that the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy, 60 years after the landing is present, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. the labeling has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create a interest. remember, the key is it the meaning to the viewer, to help Him to help you about the motive that you are moving about what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if it only has the strength only with a labeling for yourself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicame; you can also save a lot of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. you can even export him for a selection of images at the same time. KDE allows you to expose it to your wishes in the labelling and / or the title of the Web-gallery system. so you don't have to tell the story for opening hours a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train departs the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities offered by geolocalization are already irreversible and will be able to reend up with the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can also view your travel virtually via pictures with geographic data. this shows the pictures also to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; can export with the googleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and describes the practice to remove copyright limitations regarding the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information comes in the setup page of & digicame; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (author of writer and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photograph. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization may be used. according to that value, it should not be changed. this field does not support Kommas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Car title (author for the author): linked to the author. this field contains the identification number of photographers. examples of this field can be titles, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merging for the author, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the visual field to identify who offers the photo. this must not necessarily be the author. if the photographer is a news agency, such as Reuters, Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here, then the group / agency will provide the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright-sections, although they do not offer protection against abuse. everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work can be extinguished, erase or modify. the solution for this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and Halb professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digial; is available in the near future a module for staple processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record errors, record failure, blackout, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterbid, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the road or fire. this type of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, there is problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll OnTrack, the world's largest database production company, has some interesting statistics which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight for the problem with CDs / DVDs, these cautious images must be treated more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archivquality. of course, you can also claim CDs and DVDs in archival quality. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording sessions. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you're writing a lot of reliable. therefore, it turns the right to select.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to error, even if you were just writing. therefore, they use a control summing mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control environments. despite this massive protective device it requires chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, it's a favorable program called Isobster that works miracles among CDs and Linux; but there is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications that damaged data of damaged floppy disks, hard drives, flash media, USB running drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to save the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything related to CDs and DVDs was also applicable to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device for high-quality media in a non-quality media in a non-propriety format. also, you should check the media with a description, date & author's license and then on a clean, dark dry and protected animals protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floats make your statistics for itself. your manufacturer's guaranteed include a new disk, but not the data. Google introduces a large field study on error mechanisms of hard drives at your disposal: disclosure study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discos can be operated in the temperature range of 35 ¬∞ C to 45 ¬∞ C. at lower temperature control, error rate increases dramatically. some of SMART failures are the most frequent failure. these are especially Lesefehler and publishing counter. the expected lifetime exposure is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to excess voltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power outflow before you secured the files, but these losses are normally made without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices aren't much power, it looks different with devices with computer chips and high-speed sprouts. they can cause serious damage, complete data loss, hardware age, destroyed Motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against electricity points is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed by electricity. it is usually available in form of a plug-up bar. do not think any plugs also contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for a overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also consider that it offers protection against lightening protection, and thus protects the connected equipment.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because a overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should consider that all peripherals are connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage and can also provide a phone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for on the way.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection, your system protects your system from small fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of unpredictive data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a ruptible free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overvoltage, these devices can automatically operate cordless energy, if a power outage occurs. some models allow them to be able to store up the system again. if you purchase a UPS, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements such as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time is the battery and the underlying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Don't forget the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to up to & euro; 20 cost, A 500W USV can be paid for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you think about it. at the end you should always remember all the cables before you ride to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the correct configuration you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are in comparison to the hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. additionally, you have to send data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. this is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services to photos stored on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB. the professional version will not be available to you, in the case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you will get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality only.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data security, web-solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically adjusted for securing and large companies with the large companies, so they are desastersafe in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system and btrfs require at least the data integrity between your operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred, not if this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have no protection against it. no one seems to have it in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable grid parts are another source of transmission rates, as they produce interventions within the data flow. in normal filesystem, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle with turnouts on low level and is highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available at a GPL compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrine file system. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that uses zfs and is also available for & Linux; it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems. for notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most to think. it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, travel FS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the examining process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses is the greatest threat to digital data: incorrect, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that the technology continues to develop a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high-quality look, the optimum range of 6-megapixel cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full size sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk can now be responsible for 100 & euro; therefore, make no one another's loss of data loss. thus, your data is often affected by a data loss. thus assure your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make something dangerous as the re-installation of your operating system to make records of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster proposes locally and destroys a lot. don't forget aircraft strikes: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern one whole space or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desastervorak is always a not local store. bring your fuses the stairs up, into the neighbouring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a more common reason for a loss of data loss despite ensuring the panic. if you have a backup, you cannot save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential: a backup of the files have been changed since the last actuation process. this creates a complete moment of time to two points: the complete security and the last differential.</seg>
<seg id="222">Increative Securing: a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. this provides several snapshots. you can reproduce the original status at any time. this backup comes with a versioning system next with the exception that it was only untouched and not continually.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool which allows you to set up easily on your machine. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file-transmitting file rsync only the difference of files actually changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to explore losses and again. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a moment for each month. every other dilution should be done manually after which you have a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, retained XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, reinvent pictures and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,...</seg>
<seg id="227">In order to survive the next 40 years, it is about the time span that you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable with caution about what today is said with caution and reassess the time. unfortunately, there is no other way to ask oneself if the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and fuses technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. remain open to open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialized print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means, in fact, enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have plans the scalability and have the area you want to zoom on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and lay it on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Verify the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">& disk; dd if = / dev / SDB [#] of = / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBER; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS and dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read, then you can create that self. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard, but it can be much more. it is loss free, support XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG may need gamma- and chromatiauthenticity data for improved colour recognition at heterogeneous platforms. however, the disadvantage is that there is relative number of administration information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a low-loss compression balm (Defend). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted to many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File format is a licensed-free and open resource format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required for use of metadata. a handful camera manufacturers DNG is now available and we hope to use the Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why to replace the XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF. it is a description of XML and RDF. it is stored on the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer it to be archived, mostly in the rough format, mostly in the resource format. however, it may come up to problems at the link between the metadata file and the image file, and how it can be noted above. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as container and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organisation that supports a wide range of applications and business models. the DCMI communities and DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarifying efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Importing images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera image, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your primary archiv. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a subtle editing you can use external programs. if you have the pictures again with & digicame; edit, then you should add the metadata. these were cut from other programs under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in Webgaleries, encoding in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digicame; in the section add a photo to an album, you can add a description of how you can already have your hard disk. the camera interface provides you but many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendable bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect this with the machine, turn the camera on the display mode and turn them. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, you try to connect with your camera. if the connection is done, a Fertig -indicator will appear at the lower end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display a preview for file association settings, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need to download the camera information on each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a entry and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialogue shows file features and the photo information stored internally from the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Rider metadata shows the internal metadata, such as EXIF, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of & digial; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then you can download the photos from their camera into a single album in & digicame;. at the download the photos are not deleted, we will be able to check if the pictures are safe in an album before removing the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the default selection of & KDE. as soon as you select the photos, use the button to download and then select the chosen settings. the button to download is considered as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, it is possible to download a new option. these pictures have now not been downloaded from & digicame; in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in front window. if you select this option, you will only download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you're using the buttons you can download or downloading a dialog box, you will appear in which the photos are stored in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums can be sorted in section My Albums, then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After having chosen the target album, press OK, and & digicame; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete them all at once, by selecting the button delete all. if you only want to delete a few, you must select this first and delete delete your chosen ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility that you have deleted from the camera, they will be completely deleted. you should be carefully inspected if the photos are successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera, you should do this about the camera level as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names. this can result in double file names, if you have photos of various Recordings in the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the picture was made to integrate into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find Options for turning and mirrors of the image and date-based signatures. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options While the transfer will open three more options, which will be performed before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the EXIF information is copied to the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different file format as the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. turn off the option & time. for further adaptations, you should read the help of command stringtime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the Camera filename option, you will have the opportunity to change file names in lowercase, or if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digicame; for a photo used, is below the name displayed by the camera in the preview. your settings for renaming will be stored and automatically used if you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicame; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the timeline recording. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is normally turned on, and if your camera doesn't deliver these information, & digiplug; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to switch the automatic turn, use the button and select the automatic turn in the bottom range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has information about the date, where the photo was made, it can use & digicame; this signatures can be downloaded on image data. all pictures with the same date will be uploaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras will be available in the same subalbum. in the section sidebar meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photographs.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case, & digicame; the photos right on the target album. if you want to change this option, you'll need to expand this option. use the button-based subalbs at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their computer on your camera is the button Download. then select upload. the file representation dialog & KDE; appears where you can select the files uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, & digicame; you, where the images should be loaded up. a folder list dialog for the camera will appear. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position is meant to be displayed in longitude and latitude. the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographer it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane to cartographate an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability to use.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made, you can easily open a browser which can use the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digiplug. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digiplug, or just want to document this aspect, it's good to enrich the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 has many GPS data fields, such as the direction, saddle and map referrents. there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the correct hardware, via a post-machining of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to geographical assignment (manual) and last about manual entry of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera integrated with a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, these data must be stored in the GPX format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS running the data of images and from the GPS can extract and correlate. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the pretext hairy coordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street cards. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, all of the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digial; try to give you much control over its processes as possible. in order to access these settings, you need to change the behavior settings. setup dialog is divided into eight sides. you can switch between these, by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select support can be installed on embedded view or image editing. put the standard behaviour of & digial; firm, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically selected in the respective IPTC data fields if the option is selected by downloading the camera interface. also, in a database synchronisation, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Car title is a synonym for the author: this field should contain the number of photographers such as advertiser photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to enter the photo. this must not be the author if this is the photo agency, such as Reuters, or Associated Press, then the picture should be listed here, then the group or agency will be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the relevant IPTC-Felder. this means that the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of & digicame; this metadata is also available in other programs and can be imported without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Store images as embedded on images (JFIF) in JPEG image: this synchronizes the comments that you have read to your photos, with the images embedded in images. attention: for images that have already been written, these are overwritten by the digitization; overwritten.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire & digicame; can be installed on this page on the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. option & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; if you have one, then you can receive better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can switch them here. you can turn the tool bar when you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and subordinated areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image editing, this approach can be set up with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that images are encoded in higher resolution of luminance as the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the next declaration.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using PNG compressing, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG needs a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. thus, 1: a low and 9 represents a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF files can be compressed using the TIFF files. this reduces the size of TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm has no loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can store without any loss of loss. even if you have the loss of loss of loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digicame, image editing is only a picture viewer for photos. currently it develops very quickly to a tool to manipulation your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default account is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light when using this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option records the picture a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 grate pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance will use the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white is not set off. standard is it a fixed colour balance, which was photographed on a white card taken in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors have the effect that underexposed pictures in four steps more details in the shrouters. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shlichter, so the parts of your pictures are burned as to capture through the inability of your camera to capture the shlichter in various rosates. finally, you can try some parts of the missing information from the spotlights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally cannot be fed up as quickly as green and red. & digicraw are therefore trying to reconstruct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a matter how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the opportunity to set a level. here's a value of three compromises and can therefore be adapted for each picture separately.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value for your taste. you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1. this can also be done later in the image options of the & digial; image processing is made small. in order to keep the time for Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from the partial-filtered image sensor that provides many cameras and that is a Matrix colored pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digial; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it was created, but it creates color files on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color softening of your lentils you can set the red and blue proofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for a softening correction, as you are carried out during the resource conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions such as these are given. there are also LCMS and & digicame; information such as the color space from a colour space to the other, so the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior of questions when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile file Sing here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you store all your profiles. & digicame; examines this folder then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to rear. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color vision view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colourfully managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturers and model which you use. not all profiles are based on the same kind. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color mapping or gammakortive. currently, dcraw gamma does not have to convert from 16-bit depth. this means that you must perform the tonic mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the soft-proof-profile, with which you can emulate as your printer might be given a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors, so you could manually correct, instead of leaving the blind algorithm your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious what colour profile is intended for what is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. obviously, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">Canon profile extension makes the style of the goal: F for a precise style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image Plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & KDE; image viewer and image work is supported. many modules have been written to collaborate with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI module, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules that are then taken from & digicame; then, these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the pretext menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu of short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI modules you can find via the KIPI project using http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of diasau should be easy to understand. the upper controller adjust the time between frame inputs, usually 4-5 seconds good. the other crossroads turn the metadata or out that are terminated at the lower end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">Camera properties show a list of all the cameras on the left. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which is connected to a camera which is connected to the computer. currently, you are connected to the camera settings. currently, here are serial port, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the lower end, you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) -mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / m, please indicate your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; you need to connect the camera to your computer, put them in the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digicame; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the Camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any user name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can enter all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option of viewing dialog for the shift of &gt; images in the trashcan you can display the call of & digial; when deleting a photos in an album. in the sections of a photo and delete a record you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right sidebar allows to keep silent through & digicame; applied when you use the changes in the right sidebar without any refund. otherwise, you need to apply the changes with button modifications.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also take the ad of the welcome screen of & digicame; at boot, it accelerates the starting process of & digicame;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting of the start to new photos are forced & digicame; the base folder was deleted after new or deleted albums / photos. if something was deleted from the base file, it asks & digicame; you, if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of these are available as modules in & digiplug; so they are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI module you will find in section picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current filenity, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the upper edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing features change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo, before you have used the original photo. please note that you can't recover the original photo once you have stored the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save them with Save As.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not stored the photo, you can restore the original image to restore from the menu file or restore the button Restoring the image editing in tool bar. you then lose every change that you have carried out on the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image editing may be back or re-produced. the last action you can reverse, by selecting editing or restore, or select Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make use of the keyboard, Ctrl; -z for the reverse and ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you're using the & LMB; click on the toolbar or restore button in the tool bar a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all promotions will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing, you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation links in the tool bar, image high, picture down or the entries in the menu. if you have any changes on the current photo, you will ask if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can start in the photo and out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or entries in the toolbar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. it is usually displayed in the normal view, where you don't want to change the tool dialog. if you don't want this, you can view this from the & digicame; main window. see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image below and get the standard & KDE; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here, before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets. complete picture pages can be printed out of your selection. you only need to select images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export assistants. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicame; main window frames on the right edge, which is available important information and promotions for selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation spropes, also available in image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multifold button on the same rider lets the sidebar appear or disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can input labelling with unlimited size or paste. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. it means that all special characters are allowed to use EXIF- and IPTC- fields to allow you to be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut down and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC protector in other applications, you should consider this restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you comments, please use either the button users or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the applicator button there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. but this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting line. it can always be applied to a single mouse click on the sidebar or using the keyboard bar Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field. coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The tip view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword-tree and a select box with the previously used in this & digial; -session stopped.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is adapted dynamically with the search phrase. you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief for the input of sampling in a series of images. if you have entered various keywords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords are also possible by markings of the appropriate checkboxes in the tree. all Tags of the image are stored in the field of the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view, select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword in the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar stitch filter is used to change the selection of the displayed pictures displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar will be used with their album, data, sample and search requests. if additionally one or more sample filter from the right side is used, only the cutting quantity of these two will be displayed. all keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also check and put off. in the main view, you have chosen multiple images to choose from. if the keyword is already exists, you can easily put it from the right sidebar and put on the selection. as a result, a dialog can be asked whether you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter is set on no keywords, which was chosen by Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right-word-tree was taken on the selection and discarded. a dialog is asked whether this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off on settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be a or be, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which database is searched for. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an extended search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the checkbox at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr is not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store pictures in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mostly adapted to & digicame; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you have set up a colorfully-administered workflow, you can reach a predictable deviation from your camera or scanner. with a colourfully-administered workflow you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners, and the colors that you print or in the web you comply with your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes on color administration, everybody wants to know which knobs must press for the results he wants. unfortunately, the sense of this Tutorials is to provide you adequate decisions on each point of image processing workflows. additionally, you will enable you to make your own informed decisions to make your own informed decisions.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows must be met all six below criteria, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB-color space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image issues are by e-mail or the Web, where the RGB of the de facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and do the life for everyone so easy, why should one use another color space to make thoughts about color vulnerable ng?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hubs-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB space space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger farms, please visit Bruce Lindblooms topente side and then click Info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to cover my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB space space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you do not work in the sRGB space space or not, you must work your monitor. if you operate your monitor on sRGB, then you need to use your monitor on the RGB mode, then you need to use either your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automated corrections to improve the image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting to try further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, equalize, automatic and contrast to the menu automatically correcting automatic correction automatically try to make your colors the best. they will experiment with these effects, to see what seems best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method is scalable via the entire picture, so the darkest point black and the brightest item is as light as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a Magical correction for pictures of dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Dislike: this method adjusted the amplifiers of the selected image, so that the histogram of intolerance is the same number of pixels. sometimes this result is only garbage. it is a very powerful operation which causes either wonders in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic cut: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. you determines the dark and light-border shades and adjusted the red, green and blue channels on the entire history range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast widen: this method improves the contrast and the illuminance of the RGB values of a picture through the postpone of the lowest and highest values in between. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The Wei√üer von & digicame; is a semi-automated tool to carry the white equal to a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equiscation is slightly restricted to color space over a colour space containing 8-bit color. if you are able to do so far from the original plate, areas with overexposure appears. if you are working in the white mode, which can be done in 16-bit mode, your options are better due to correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white equating element that is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. it's starting the menu entry in white-like white image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The front window can be adjusted in size. on the left side are adapted both the original pattern as well as the preview of the target image. if you want to see the original whistle, then you can click on the original window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target group features a red Marker. the Luminance of Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up, a histogram is displayed as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful there, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shading details of your photos or down.</seg>
<seg id="401">With the above-mentioned checks, you should use the color temperature Pipette. press on this button and then anywhere on the picture preview for the color temperature of the white color. this type is also set automatically the temperature and green values automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the Wei√üer directly with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indicator increases the colors, if more than a colour channel of pixels is overexposed. you will be the combined result in the Wei√üerequate. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons Save as and store do exactly this. any setting of the White comparison you have set to store in a text file and load again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preferences sets all the filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white-comparison list. note that neutral settings will be a different picture as your original. when you store this, your original pattern will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the code depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit coding is the far common JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high quality images. this coding also requires more record pitch, calculating time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of paint profiles. color mapping can be carried out through the subwindow for using paint profiles. detailed instructions for use of paint profiles can draw the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in menu using sound value correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously. this is useful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction. in the manual to the sound value correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digicame; tool color effects provide four colour effects, a bicycle effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar sterilization, also called Sabatian, a effect of the delicate photopapron of the additional light. this also had the effect that the brighter areas were darker and colours by the second lighting inverted. this tool was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at about 50% intensity the image shows what is possible. another increase is finally a negative image that is not done on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original pattern is the (1) and the processed intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from one saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a slightly turned colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also some photographers, especially those that weigh hardly any landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repetitions the strength of the neonlich√©. in large images, the filter can trigger the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it's not unusual you want to correct the colour concentrates and the illuminance of photos. you can try to experiment with the options in the menu. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can get a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem. even in this case, the tool is necessary to reduce the saturation instead of raising them. all changes you can perform in preview. if you like this result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound value correction for improving exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you will need to clarify the range of application for this tool. concrete, the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel, or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders can be clicked into the clicks and that can be moved to change the intensity of the image. the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the control is shifting the regulator and make sure how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand you can see the original and preview of the image. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: using this selection box can be set, whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logical scale division is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for middle tones often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image, to automatically adjust the input of the shadows, medium and bright tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to evaluate the output value as well. compression of output values can be used, for example, to create a very easy picture as background, while something else can be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and shop: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be stored and later reloaded again. it will use Gimp levels format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and re-use the three color pipette, the input will automatically be adjusted to all shadows, means and sundeparts. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option oversupply indicator indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below, you can see an example for the alignment of the input data applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target image displayed. the preview will be dynamic depending on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this select box allows you to specify the channel which is changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are found to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures featuring a digital camera, linear mode generates a wide beams. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short trip to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can view that these bright tones can correspondled with darker prunes and corresponding to the corresponding image pixel.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red markings visible. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change the original value, create a point on this line and move it up and down, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and shop: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every turn you can create this file system can be uploaded and later. file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you are using this method and the three color pipaces buttons automatically create control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, means and solar panels. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original sign for the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed indices indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black-and-white photo that has been corrected in the Luminanzchannel. shadow and sunbathe was applied using the color pipette and applied to the curves (1) and the revised (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The canal mixer of & digial; image editing is a tool to improve color channels, or change the color shades of photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colour tones of images. you can edit it from the menu Color-Mixer mixer.</seg>
<seg id="443">Selecting the box office you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be viewed as opposed to your rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red Marker. if you positioned this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right below: controls for red, green and construction will allow you to activate the corresponding color components. this is particularly convenient if you can also check the appropriate color components. this is particularly convenient if you can also reduce the corresponding color components. this is particularly convenient if you can reduce the color scheme to generate great black-and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white Portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a colour is exposed to a visible smoke, which occur in the same place in the colour channel and whose noise pattern in each channel is different. if that is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Storing as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any arbitrary setting can be stored for later and then upload. the used file format is the gimp-mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option oversupply indicator indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was recadjusted. option Luminanz will be activated. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating due to your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working step, as color pictures can be converted simply on the computer. also with a set of film rollerprofiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, in all the scenes and fits especially good to portraits of the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) of a green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photographs. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orange.</seg>
<seg id="454">RotFilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic warn effects and can simulate lunar effects on the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) RotFilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lentil filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones during a little cold in the shades. this is very similar to the process of a lead and recovery in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and so similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digicame; tool texture may apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture whether it's a color image or not, you can look like a painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry picture texture of the image processing can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone of this parameter to the right increases the amount of depth or three-dimensional texture in the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture is applied on the picture below. the original pattern is (1) and the modified under (2). parameters relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicame; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to set up a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the streak eye. under the frame, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you turn the desired frame type for your picture. through the image with a colored line, Niepce rends it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), cut off with a nice three dimensional frame of the ideal place for a bone effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: gives the width of frame in percent. the range of value for width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert a single-format text into a picture at any place. this also works at several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with its features like you need. the larger the image, the larger the character set must be. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every attitude that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button "OK." after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool template, you can apply a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu picture templates. use templates in the image processing can be used to lay templates about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should add using maximum compressing (9) to simplify your template's file size; please send an e-mail to the & digicame; Mailing list digicame-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you'll need to set your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have the template files. these settings are marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root canopy was placed for the stencils, a building management, which reflects the folder structure of templates. selecting a folder, the selection of stencil will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview, there are three buttons with which you can change the enlargement factor and position your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob enlarges the image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinking: this button shrinks the underlying picture. it will be centred around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template on the whole picture, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to postpone the picture below the template. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template on your image. the image will be adapted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">Digitization; presents three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, created but, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Uncertainty mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture. indeed, it's not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it's been a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refokussic is probably the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. these elements are smaller than the resolution will be combined with only minimalist differences. the same phenomenon can be seen if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequent sharpening than normal cameras for the home user.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG image frequently have been applied to a camera internal sharpening. images in the rough size must always be harmed during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a sharpening device already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by choosing a photo with sharpening verke. you can correct your application with the menu application.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should hereby be careful because the results are not very natural: sharpening raises the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the useful technology can be used to correct a picture. in general, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution, the picture a little soft to draw, is much easier to use. use the tool to soften and experimenting something with settings. the front window on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is fuzzy masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help edit the picture. the display window shows the output of the fillet with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. default values are often good results and should be tried out. if you make the sharper mask to be strong, noise and impression of grats will produce in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore adjust pictures at best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wisely image added to the original. this makes the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB-value and to apply differential amount. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpenalties is excluded, and therefore beauty errors in the faces, celesticks and water surface areas.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of unsharp mask filters. the original picture is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masking was applied using radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitised; tool Refokusingly refocussed a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the urging legal discharging filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool attempts a picture to & quot; refocussing quot; in which it uses defatization. it uses a technology called FIR Vienna Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a uncertainty mask. you can start it from the menu by calling colors Refokusability in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular clamping is much better than the Gau√ü's folding. the Gau√ü's Failleur has a very long tail, which is far from the original quins pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse the Gau√ü's Failleur is influenced in most cases, which causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the main parameter for use of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher level when your image is very unsharp, then you should pay attention to Heiligenpons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpenultimate effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in space filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a high value will still keep the image still further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your indeficife filter is caused. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you have a value to zero, you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizensize: this value determines size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the Gau√ü's sharpness. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Storing as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any relocating parameters which you have set will be stored for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations change the changes are not immediately visible, but then left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and cover pictures, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by using unsharp masking a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to create unsharp masking and always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the needles. practical, the result of the FIR Vienna Filters always can be at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small interfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is attributable to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods for sharpening, digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator is set up the sharpness of the range of the area in order to generate a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">Color ink allows a customized colour for pupils. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most developed tools in order to remove non-specific artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preferences as starting points to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">In case you want to adjust the filter settings required, you can use the riders access and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth smoothing about the picture. a value of 0,9 should be so aware that no sharpening should be required afterwards. please note that the details always should be ordered.</seg>
<seg id="520">Unit dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value of smoother equally in all directions, while a value close to 1 is only in one direction. if you create a film grain or CCD noise will create a high value of wave similar patterns. JPEG artefacts will be best in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this puts the maximum bulb factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value matching the sound of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Rule: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is difficult if it's difficult to produce the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it is necessary to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: there are often 1 or 2 algorithm to go through. usually this is usually 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Elongings long da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen, it should be also small. make sure that small angles generate a long term. therefore, you should choose this value acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step wide [0,1, 10]: integral step in pixels. you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: this option is only small. it doubles the runtime. but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and store do exactly this. any setting of image errors can now be stored in a text file, and then again be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Picture errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and move a high CPU load. so you can therefore break the calculation anytime with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see such image errors with small artifacts. the module is made on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact that caused by a bad film setting during the trip. the original image is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicame; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce images. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artefacts, i.e. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensing noise from the camera or Moirealy; -Effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on digital cameras, so you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The image picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a gracey noise that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced settings can remain at the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters per pixel and can move the picture above the picture and the colour in it is smoother and thus smaller faults.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpening of sharpness. if it is increased, noise drops will be reset. if it is increased, noise may be reset. if the value is too high, the adaptive filters picture details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the film. if it is too strong, the whole noise can occur or noise may occur. put it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either paint or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either paint or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of darker areas, typically more strongly inflicited, however he adds up the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of phasenjitterdamping. this value defines the edges of smoother, if it is increased to high. if it is increased to its minimum, noise and phasenjitter may occur on the edges. he can remove noise and is the recommended method.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for smokers that have set you can be stored in the file system and then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected output has been used with standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution, the picture a little soft to draw, is fortunately much easier to use a picture. use the tool to soften and experimenting with the glalogical button on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicame; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photoartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesired artifacts, film grazing, scratches, compressive or retrospectively digitalised images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and receives the content as well as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textures. the texture is done with another tool, the image error correction, performed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frans and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts Reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss of compression & quot; it creates some compression & quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed picture. this attitude shall correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons Save as and store do exactly this. every attitude of photo restoring can be stored in a text file, and then again be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. so you can therefore break the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce like a photo with balance-shaped noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded using a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film gracks on the faces. you can see the notorious film gracks on the faces. the original image is under (1) and correct under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures have been taken on an old colour photo, which has been taken with a scanner - the scanning artifacts can be seen from the scanning lighting and the photopapier. the original image is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicame; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixel from photos that were with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dicklop.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are particularly high in high quality raw mode photos, because many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark picture subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to explore the dark picture directly in the connection to explore new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct picture. notice that the wizard will notice the last dark pixels and again automatically reload this in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct within the picture. the movie window shows the output of the filthy with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all presides.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the faulty pixel on the preview and the results of the movie. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Dursection: there is an average of neighbor pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels have a distance of 1 from pixel block to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixel.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixel with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn, to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixel.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures, applied. the original image was increased to 300% (1) and the correct image is seen below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicame; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e., underexposed corners, a picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can often reduce the overall sensor field not evenly. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) it can reduce the corners and edges of the image, by reducing the light that can be achieved there under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 with the bladder that it is impossible to keep the camera with hand. far angle lens should also be used, even with center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise uncertainty effects through movement arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by simulating a equivalent transformation at a picture which is made without these filters. algorithm is protected by a Centerfilter. algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light-amplifiers at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or randomly compensate the density around a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstarch, Contrast and Gamma -Settings: editing a picture with the Vignetting correction reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to adjust exposure of the target image with these options. the controllers provide you only positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more subtle readjustment of the target image, so let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation out of the & digial; image processing of the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the vinetting in the corners and (2) the correct image. a lamp and contrasting correction was also carried out with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digial; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or konvexe form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect, but laughs at the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The co-efficient grader corrects the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree. this value increases more strongly to the edges than in the center of the picture. for most lentils the 'corners' has the reverse prefix of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value is scaled the image size and leads to a correction first graft through. negative values increase during positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusted the brightness of the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners while positive values them increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrating the dialogue with a preview of distortion correction. the values that you use for your image will be saved and used as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons and hoveraging correction should be carried out before all addressing or size changes. best result, if you cut a picture new and then carry out a ton-shaped correction, the effect would seem apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line. move it to an important place, such as the ocean side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place. in connection, you can correct the mash / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a verging distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or zoom on the zoom controls.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the tonal-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as photos of the front, frame and paintings is the perspective to correct all the angles at the picture 90 degrees. please note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of a tons-shaped correction for a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website that can be found under this URL. filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 iso.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you shift the red rectangle with the mouse, you can see the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters for film grain and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the grazing texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color channels are mixing the reproduce of infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film based on a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original pattern is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digial; filter film extraction is an easy to use tool to reproduce film grazing on your pictures, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. in order to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturer has great silverware of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from daily life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road photographic, graniches look specially to your monochrome photos, so you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values need to use on ISO-2400. if you still need more grains, you may apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grain effect on a black / white picture. the original picture is the (1) and that processed the (2). it used film sensitivity to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicame; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicame; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil paintings. natural pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the upper one chooses the brush size between one and five. thick brushes are better for large images. smoothing controls the smooth or, viewed from the other side, the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processed size is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicame; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a carboneskizze. therefore, images of their gradients are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen for you to sketch. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator choose the pin size and the bottom adjusted the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal label filter. the original pattern (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digial; Filter engraving your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; Filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important thing about the content. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a grey, month landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows to set the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and looks like whether it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wavelength 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can break these effects anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by incorrect effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: get the picture through sternmost lines run by a centre. this simulates the sharpen of a zooming camera, thereby creating a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial insharpness: wipes the picture by turning the pixels around a centre. this simulates the incorrect one of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance needles: do the image capture the effect of a non-focused camera system. the object seems to resign in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement needless: distorted the picture through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the inconsistencies of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photography, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft inscription: get the image softly in dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-photos or add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shimmering: distorted the picture by accidental displacement of pixels and simulates the inconsistencies of a arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Disuses: finds the paddling pool in the picture and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo into rectangular cells and then created it through the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice little tool to make regentropes on your picture. this makes it natural your pictures a great appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn urging legally protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Trophy size allows to change the size of the drops. since the trophy size does not grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. Fischaugen change the optical effect of the drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can handle with the & digial; image editing is required free of shelves. use the range -tool to pick up the range, e.g. a face, which should remain free. if you then start the filter Regentropes the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the drop film Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset from a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, so you can bring it through spies or rotating into the right orientation. the tools you can find in the menu transformer and make mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo-blowing is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo, at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you find a picture of up or guess the details? how can you find the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm used here is a good work. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it on the desired size with the size size. select transformation size change in the menu, and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change is using linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to increase a picture. & digitised; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">4 aspect ratio maintain: when this setting is enabled, the new size aspect ratio may retain the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Rule: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is difficult if it is difficult to produce the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it is necessary to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and store are used exactly. every single deposit for photo enlarge can be stored as text file, and later be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and move a high CPU load. you can break the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of a picture of the picture shows a small colour image increased to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargers.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cut of a photo is not only a performed surgery, but also an frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. image editing will just create a picture with the mouse, pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, generate. you will then see this rectangle while you move your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again the area of photos is cut out. by this way, you can change a good overview of your photo after the cutting area. you can drag the size of a cutting area by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle, you simply create with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the section, use the button "button button in the tool bar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or file Save to store the newly created photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the storage area, you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you've defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high size, the size of the height and cross-format size is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool is used to aspect ratio aspect ratio. this means it is always equal to use any other physical size, regardless of whether you see centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue, two buttons exist about the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Down in the dialog you can set the Max. ratio button to cut the range for cutting on the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation, place.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio allows you to use the settings depending on image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are stored for the cutting tool, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the support for help allow assistance to enable you to watch your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party, harmonic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle towards a harmonious triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things that we look as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you include your pictures, buildings and even photos, to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derided by the Fibonacci episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number is according to the sum of their two ahead. the resulting part is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition this usually follows as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents liquid aid lines if you are an image. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">Golden spiral becomes your goal to get good results for your photos. compared to third party organ, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition runs along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is called the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. it should be something that the eye can be at the heart of the composition. it can be a line or different objects. this can be simply because of being without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derives from the above-discussed gold spiral. in contrast to the harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equalled triangles. diagonal to these lines can place a static object of more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles to break your frame, you create a effect of professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you cannot reach.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirrored can be used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the lines can be invisible. on this type you can adjust the color of the lines to your actual picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to turn an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you are making a photo, it's easy to keep the camera horizontally or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are shot at an angle. you can fix it with the & digitised; image editing and the tool free rotation. select Free Press and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slipangle. the values on this slipcase are specified in degrees. you can set the switch back to 0 degrees. a preview of the shooting is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the Internet module provides an horizontal and vertical line. do you move to position the mouse pointer in the picture preview for the two lines. now adjust it to an important point of the image. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair this is the function transformer cut from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivical transformations are carried out around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialogue, you will find some information which will help you view the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new picture, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new picture, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the top: displays the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees to the bottom edge of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Corner to the right: shows the current angle in degrees to the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image becomes a bit scrubberized. for a single customization, this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After passing the perspective, you get unjoyful triangular holes in the corners. one way to transfer this is the picture with transformation cut from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite side. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can launch this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Switch your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can press horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press on preferences, the angle is reset to zero. a preview of effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed right from the front area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the button tool to adjust the lines to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After having carried out the switch, the picture will be a bit wiped out. for a single rotation, this effect is usually negligible, but two swings calculates twice as much stress and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the calibration, the image has imply triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is the image with transformation cut from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicame; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way such as these libraries have been compiliated. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. but they will always JPEG and TIFF will be found.</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to use this file format. a detailed description of this file formats can be found on Wikipedia. & digicame; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital pictures. redundant information is reduced to save the image data on an efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s can also save losses when indicated in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the resource format, so you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can find Rohformat pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digicame. in the configuration, you can find further information about the use of modules with & digicame;.</seg>

<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user-friendly graphic surface with all functions of a well integrated & KDE; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& graphic viewer; is a KDE program for viewing of & graphviz; -dot; -channels are free layout programs. & graphs; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & KDE; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & Konqueror; (making a change of Graphene in & Kate; Graphene Graphene and in & kgraphviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the Graphene in & Kate; to open or to open graphs in & graphs; in one & Kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Load big graphs (currently there are problems starting from around 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other required software: & graphviewer; is a & KDE; program, which requires the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for displaying the graph, are needed in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the open graphs, each in its own window. at first, when you start & kgraphviewer, the main window is empty as in the lower screen. in this case, the toolbar only contains the icon file open and the (empty) list reopened files. click on the first icon to view the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; -files are selected, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview of the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressing & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you can see the maximum distortion of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file just changed in & kgraphviewer; loaded file from another program is displayed, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be reloaded, or if you want to ignore the change, so that your decision may change, so you can change your decision later, you can set up the menu settings kgraphviewer; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphite file outside of a running & graphic viewer; -Instance, & eg; in file-browser or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphviewer; instance, want to open or want to exhibit graphs in a subwindow of the already ongoing instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but these can also be retrofitted with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">During program start, you can open all the graphs of your last meeting again. again, you can save your choice both, and later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also define how the graph should be split by several sites. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using several sites, you can choose if the parts of the graph will be placed on this site. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph.</seg>

<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or histochemical representations of directed graphs. the algorithm pushes the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce a short edges and a few edge overlapping.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unerized graphs. it produces representations according to the sprint model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm uses, which is synonymous with statistical indimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates for unerized graphs a sprint model layout. it uses the Fruit-Reingold-Heuristik, and includes a multi-gradient for the treatment of large and clusters.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & circo; algorithm orders the knots circular at the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog box in which you can specify a layout command, which can then be carried out by a shell. the command should give graphs to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify special options, or graphs the graphs with a filter before being drawn.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization, tools are available to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system, which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude of latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman may download and convert data from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface may merge a number of selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-sighted dialog appears. to load a possible correlation between time and localization, this file contains, of course, data that have been recorded at the same sites as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation that shows the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera will need to be converted with GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum period deviation for the maximum period of time is an upper variance for GPS-time and camera sovereignty. the deviation is to be merged. the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one place to edit the GPX file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options Interpolishing and Difference in min can be used if you don't have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location between camera and GPS lies, you can place this boundaries here and then correlate the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set up with this dialogue. this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next notice, you just need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the shown map and to be set. in addition, select the relevant region and increase sie.add this to the appropriate accuracy. the card must always be manually selected. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here's a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages. character set is encoded with UTF-8 to enable a possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to HTML. you need these albums only. the albums will not choose from hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly choose a large number of albums on the right side. in the area below, the Albenvorce and the text will appear in the head of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab visual appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this rider is largely self-explained. if you then click on a picture a new page will be displayed in the image. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider record defines the settings and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images. select a folder from which you have writing permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you select the JPEG file format, the EXIF information is also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colour depth you can change the standard colors depth. naturally, the file size does, of course, change the file size. all other settings are explicable.</seg>
<seg id="828">The horsemen profile allows you to watch some of the settings from the album tab for the thumbnails, these are small pictures displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user as far as the action is. press the break down to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module generates the pages it will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program reports to determine if mistakes appear during production. the web browser is automatically launched at the end to display the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to look at images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like filming, zooming or shift. the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons. it was developed for a quick display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After starting a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Loss module is a tool to change pictures without interfere with your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to store images in JPEG format for the below, without the usual losses on quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size is increasing since there is no compressing of the color-formations. for example, one can be found at the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that you can connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera system currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at KDE-Imaging @ kde.org. caution: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the KDE-Imaging @ kde.org lists of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the importing function of the metadata module, you can copy the data from one image to another. then, then, you can copy the import function, so the image will be able to copy the file representation. the data will be copied after you have pressed the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please look at exiv2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in form of diasau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodiers can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages Mjpeggio and ImageMagick. between the individual pictures you can add a basic image transfer. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of diasau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can create a background color for the diasau. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the media, you can only use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG Diaschau. after that, you can launch the module via extras maschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected from you can then be listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. if you are planning the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds which will display a picture. the speed of the image output is defined below. a lower value produced very sudden, a great contrast, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background colour may be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. the name and the path of the generated file can be set under the name of the mpeg-output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, this is integrated into the film. depending on your computer, you can start with the button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a coffee or enjoy a coffee when you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, so you can adapt the paths to the programs of the Mjpegra and ImageMagick packages on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photogotle. this is also useful with image processing Gimp. this is for example: useful to print them or print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import / edit your stored images in one of three formats, JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is not expected that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, choose the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. you can see the effect on your current settings to the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values new to optimize conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the Wei√üer. essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can proceed the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected, so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and the file name remains unchanged and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a low-loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or later, you should not choose the JPEG format, as it requires only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as storage format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process again, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking mode allows you to convert different images to once. use this mode as you are sure, for example, using a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the opportunity to overwrite the file automatically. this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt. however, the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compressed all images in an album. it uses the program card from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and timestamp should be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the product under the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image, or enlarge. there are four types of image change available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image will be selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">No proportional representation change in two dimensions. aspect ratio is altered at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the picture for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of photopeniers. the target image, including background size, boundary size and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of sending images previously. further images can draw on the list of sending images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After having started the module, the images window will be displayed with you selected images. add the button images, you can add more images to the selected image. for the last selected image will be displayed a preview on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures to the picture list and add it to the list of sending images.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images, select the selected pictures from the list of sending images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all images, you can open the new message with the new message of your e-mail clients. you only need to add the addresses and the subject. they have to be attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending e-mails. it might be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change settings for sending images. their configuration is stored and used every time again until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify in the input field, including the correct path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After adding comments in a hung file, the comments will be added to images into a text file and added the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it's best to use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, the original exifdata will be added to the image file format.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically be closed, the status is automatically closed, looking for errors, and their e-mail program will be automatically launched at the end. with the button Close you can swallow this window? en.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module's advanced diasau, a window with questions such as you want to have shown. you can choose between the selected and all the pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions in the presentation uses very elegant image transfer using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the diasau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the filename of the pictures in the left corner during the presentation is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can manually start with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that images are displayed in a random order. so it will not be used in order to see images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Delay between the pictures can be set to the timely distance between each images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test this before you show the presentation your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly select another effect from each transition between pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide you can access a tool bar on the upper left screen. move the mouse in this corner to switch you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can start presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the diasau.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left side of the screen, you can view the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at KDE-Imaging @ kde.org. caution: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI Module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the user surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the current selected image, depending on the selected option of submen√ºs, as a background for your KDE-working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, you are now in each group, so in persons, places and in group keywords are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories you have entered your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look at the EXIF-based information, look at the folder structure on your hard drive and, of course, look for them.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images are displayed on which both persons can be seen. through this selection method, you can limit the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand pictures to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have chosen all the people, places and other settings you can see with thumbnails to view the pictures of your action area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same icon in front of its name. they can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person a separate text, that is, of course, also defined for places, keywords and other categories that you have defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display pictures next to the name, select the button, which is located right on the toolbar. in the current context menu, you can choose which you can view the list for each category. it has the advantage that you can show symbols with images of persons and simultaneously a list of sample literal (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to define the image for every single person. to do this, you'll need to edit the image file window in the image. here you can adjust the image for the corresponding person. in the menu window you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and thus select what part of the image is to be shown or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you can find the entry in the main window, you will find a dialog displayed by the dialog for the Festing Image properties. this dialog can view you on the image once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labelling or description, you can also enter a date or descriptions of the pictures following this text. if you want, you can also be a date for example; the date can be either part of the total date, i.e. for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can search all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, according to pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but prefer to try the following functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and check out the fast-up, screen photos and introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog; and select the menu for the first time, or select the menu for the menu entry onphotoalbum; then a few example pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, please find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a connected HTML-document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the lower edge of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this glue you can see here:. as the name suggests, this glue shows you data stats over images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each glue shows a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bodies only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timer can interact on the following ways: you can change the displayed message view from the database (if you select a date, you will see the first picture of this date in preview page) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures if you navigate in the preview section.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by pressing the mouse button and the mouse over the lens of the timeline, so the timeline is displayed. if you select one area, you will be able to break down images of this period. you can break the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; it offers two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures; the one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module is available; integrated version, which you can create via the HTML menu... click.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages have to be created, you need to make some settings. these are split into the three areas of content, layout and goal. in the following, each area will be accurately described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the bligcks and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on photo-photo album; HTML sample pages, see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose from whether a & photo album may be created; export file is to be seen on the viewing page. some information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information is displayed on the HTML pages. for example, that all pictures of a party are obvious. for example, note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. you can't use this attitude to hide certain images in particular amount.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most importing possibilities are clear why not received so special in this area.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust various resolutions on the pictures. this allows those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no images, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution any time you have defined. so he can run your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, as well. if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best chose for all your HTML files a base folder, and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you have to select the main folder in which all your pictures will be stored. this folder will be saved and select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if this really is visible to the viewer. if you have been created for the base folder a web browser, after the pages have been created, the URL you should be here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files are not yet in final destination, you will need to manually copy them manually. in order to specify the import function, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of files. this is not the sub-file of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The only described configuration options described have all three on base folder or URLs. in these, a subfolder created, whose name you define in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking for a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to apply a HTML page to view the images. if you have already booked a lot of time for viewing the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not be done once more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can import a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. these can import other data in your database. image characteristics are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in that, whether the images are stored in the file, or whether it's only a link to images. the advantage may have all the images into the file, and that file may be so independent, but the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a double way. first, the images are not found, so the images of the URL, which you have specified in the creation of HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file via HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, dialogue for exporting images is described, which you can export about the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it should act in internal or external .kim files. there are the following three options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">To manually copy the .kim file, you will need to copy the images into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">"" "with the option" "" "Automatically" "" "copy to the .kim file and copy the pictures automatically for you." ""</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it normally is not worthwhile to compress the files. if you like this, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limiting maximum image size. if you send your friends images, the .kim file would be very large, as the .kim file would be very large, for example, you can say that each image is to be 800 pixel wide and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu icon... select & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to impairment consists of four steps. first you need to select what pictures you want to import, afterwards, in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you personalised the number of persons with the import file (if you are a Dane) while this category is called for your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialogue window, which should be imported in the third dialogue window, and what are the categories that are imported in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can purchase the categories of import file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to browse images and look at: if you look at images, you want to see images often within different image groups and mdash; if you want to see images from your Italy vacation and see a picture with your boyfriend, you may want to see all pictures where this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps of (1) fixed information about your pictures, via (2) the search and look to through (3) advanced topics and adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today your videos is taking care of. in many places in this manual, images are spoken about images, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can back with a program of your choice, e.g. normals backup tools, copy on a disk or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remember the folder in which your pictures are stored and automatically re-use this when you want to read another database with pictures, so you can start a different folder with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the option -c. for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Set up on the menu input settings; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum. in the following section of the user book, you will be explained to the various setup possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you will see six different symbols, with which you can call setting options for viewing and the options for the viewer. for each setting, you can find an exhaustive assistance to the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you how to create various properties, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">In view, you can see the dialogue that is used to process existing groups. for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog box you can set full member groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of a centre-glimping.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view, you can select the installation possibilities that you want to select the list of members. with the above select list you can select the category you can configure. in the left window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; this module is split with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & KDE; image Plugin interface. some information can be found on the box of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called on the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can call via the modules.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together among each other together, it can be used to test the modules with & colon album; therefore, you should use new modules first with the demo-database, before you call this on your own pictures; Demo database &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. don't say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & colon album; do not work. this is the downside when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The greatest difference between & photo album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, simulates it for some modules the order to albums, so you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Thereby simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & on-photo album has to be handed over; the modules also has a list of albums. here & on-photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & on photo album; S browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all the people, then every entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be used as a category for virtual albums in this category. for example, if you are using the category persons, it will be done & kphotoalbum; so do if you have chosen people to view this and continue the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove these from the list of modules. start the settings dialog, and select the modules that are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a start screen, as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you have used it from any other KDE application, you can see above a menu and a tool bar. in the section we will see no information about your pictures. in the section we will see at this window, but now click here to show you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with notes on the picture where the picture was taken on, where the picture has been taken either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time. if, for example, on all the pictures of Jesper, and all pictures have been recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want to see this notes when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In, you can see three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you can always use it again if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the moving images inside the list: if you are depicted for example a family party and over all the 50 pictures the same 5-10 people are depicted, so you can find that the used names are moved up, which can be found faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get a alphabetically sorted list, click the icon for sorting under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any comments on each image individually, you might want to edit all selected images and have these pictures with notes. just click on the front and back buttons that are located below the picture of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu option more multi-added entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. furthermore, San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. to indicate that it is a group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new type or subcategory. in addition, you can also submit an entry to a category of subcategory. attention, this assumes that you are just alphabetically sorted out your categories.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the individual elements of the dialog box by setting the glue which form the upper edge of the frame, click and postpone. you can also make a window with your own window by drag him out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs, you click on the button options... which allows you to save the current construction and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also make a frame entirely off. if you want to get this window again later, use the button options... and then you can enter a / out window. this process can be seen in the image.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in your browser, you will receive an overview with prescient images, or all the images if you do not have filters. for example, you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply down toes the mouse with the middle shelf, configure. try it easy.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you have a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this image will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture preview. simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete and press either the remove button or select in menu Edit menu. now you will show the window that you can see in the image.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; for this problem, you can also use a solution. you can also use pictures stored on the hard disk. of course, you have to take pictures somewhere in the database. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images which are cut to the right corner are not stored on the hard drive. however, this is available for pictures 1-9. however, for pictures 5-9, however, this pictures can display the preview of these pictures. however, you cannot see these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see this feature, you will need to copy files from the folders and copy them again. so, it's not supported until now you want to avoid the inserts of the question. if you want to avoid trouble, like the flow of your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In menu images, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to stay a little more privacy, you'll find the pictures so that you can see for others unapproachable, you can also watch all pictures you can see your little sister, increasing, and select the menu entry everything except for current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this, you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of your little sister, simply lock the menu entry, so select all the images that you have locked away. if you want to get the images right, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to establish a password which must be entered into the images. to establish this password, simply select password change in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please note that this picture protection is not very secure. for one you can read all pictures on the hard drive and to the other one can read the password as unencrypted text, only those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to defend the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to review all your pictures with & photo albums; of course and hours over hours to review you, of course, you want to see them sometime. from this reason & photo gallery has a picture _ and video viewer. this is a preview of how you can start.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows naturally the image, but additional all the information you have about the picture, such as who is on the image, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox is on the upper part of the picture you want to see, so you can easily configure which information is displayed and if all these options are displayed in the viewer. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. all these options are available below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see, matching entries to this view. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures from Anne Helene. as if you had chosen people from your browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images to the viewer, you can switch between them and go back by using the keys picture high and image down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded on the viewer, you can run these as diasau. & kphotoalbum; then you can download a new picture after a few seconds. as frequently it can press a new picture, you can start the Ctrl keys and plus or minus the slide through the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability to the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen-mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer in the picture, you can easily pull out the image into the image. with the Minus key you can draw out again a rectangle The Plus button zoomed in the center of the picture shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooma.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not zoomed. with the equation setting the zooms so each pixel is equivalent to a pixel screen pixel screen.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work at videos that are in and out with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the filming features from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make notes about the actual picture with the menu entry from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you can look at images, you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set on the picture. in the moment you can view the break and configuration dialog at the picture to mark this name. but you may prefer to mark the image and look at another pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and watch them as good or bad, while you're looking for one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to watch pictures with features while looking at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letter. in view, you can see a picture where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. so if you have all the pictures you can edit, print or whatever you have selected, so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the front view, then you can add features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the characteristic, after the picture was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. this case allows you to paint & photo album; on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The brick is not stored with the image, but in the database. on the type you can reverse your weird later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In a picture you can see a picture on the painting. to switch the painting of & photo album; click on the picture paint from the context menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar above.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; do not have to control the application of the program & Povray; not fully controlling, but the documentation on & Povray; should you absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object-tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object shown in the wire-modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object, since all the objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position when you want to add the object and select either the icon in the tool bar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following entry-down menu will end, so you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Using delete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply this changes. if you have invalid values, you can report an error message with an error message. then, you can reset the input command or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you work on a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview of your own resources.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press on a preview of the self-economic view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture. as default, if you want a subordinate element, you can only cross a part of the texture (e.g. a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture-map), cross it locally.</seg>

<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the Rendering symbol Rendering in the tool bar or select the menu view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode is equivalent to the entries in & Povray; it defines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to rendering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add any number of Render modes, from a quick preview of up to full images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render-box in the toolbar or in the menu view mode, select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Any Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but sense is a name that lets you recognize the properties of mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to rendering a small area of the image, choose the cross section and give the image cut to rendering into input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination box quality, you can select the properties, the & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the User manual & Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is lowered with only one beam, different bugs can arise. these pictures often have a Moir√® pattern or stud-effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. generally, pictures with this feature is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you enter anti-aliasing, computed and connects & Povray; more than a beam of pixels. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super sampling. standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is split up again and adaptive because each pixel is split up and adaptive to the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method POV-Ray pursues a beam of pixels. if you adjust the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels, both pixels are calculated by the persecution of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points is calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values the foreseen threshold, then the pixels in 4 subpixel will be checked, and the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you deposit Jittering, change & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it takes a long time to calculate the diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card, you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated radiators have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1077">So you just installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start with more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you are able to create all steps in this manual, you should use the ultimate but easy scene with beginners: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider following warnings carefully before you complain that you can only use a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for first time, you should consider this important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't adjust camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you will get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't add light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you'll get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything faultless, you see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window allocation should:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbars. please read the documentation, so you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first select all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu input. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireless model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you generate. in particular note that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the camera's point of view. this shows you the results of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new record with the name camera. if they click on it, you will see the contents of the object characteristics, where the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation, please find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for instructions, but notice that the camera can change in view control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on the left button and drag him to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button user or the input, the wireless model views and the object tree immediately change these settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the scene for the scene. you could adjust for example a Quader (insert final body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a permanent method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually, offers a simpler opportunity. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button user or the input design. in the object tree, the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also shows the plane, although at the moment only as limited maximum level. if you rendering the scene, the plane will expand to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree, you'll notice that you can see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you can see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you can see the different parameters for each new object: scaling, turning and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should postpone the floor to exercise a unit below the Horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose displacement and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to set its material characteristics. there are many different materials, but select something unique in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue with which you can select as the object should be inserted. please choose the first object. you can change the name in the object image (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button look, you can see how the pigment looks like this.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments will only have a matt black material, because you need to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. now, there are many possibilities now, but take the simplest way now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on Quader and ball, just click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you cross your image with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you are not the colour scheme. you have to set two new attributes. in the colour list, you'll need to specify two new attributes. then you can do this entry twice (you can do this also more often, but the box-color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select the colors in the view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already be able to execute, because you should have the fundamental labor mode of & kpovmodeler; you can already agree. the ball is just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input, or press the button), so the ball would swallow over the ground, because you have moved the floor for a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering results are now a strange result: as already before, the globular surface is like a mat black material. put in the following step into a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the sphere, you can now refer to a material. as already in the bottom, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first subject, and change the name for example in the pigment. click on the Pigment, then choose one color and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach an interesting effects if you take time to set some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change values like in the following screen photos and click on Apply or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already yielded some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of which opportunities you & kpovmodeler; and hopefully you've already learned something that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytrayearning is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renders hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera which is reflected in the scene) through any pixel size, reflecting the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as atmospheric effects such as mists. so, the scene is processed into pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source you can see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously every scene, that should be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>

<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a possibility to accumulate rough surfaces, without altering any beers on the surface and without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It's usual to use the same file for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic body. these models will then be processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, using an image file as a color card.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-interface from Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functionalities from collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists and scripts; look like:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & KDE; additionally Amarok added some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed due to a lack of dependency. please check in your script, whether all required modules are available and use dialog, so the user does not run why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' Rescue error error = 'Corundum (KDE binding for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is Required for this script.' dialog --sorry '# {error}' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / templates, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand the needed functions. you will quickly find that the script is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP can exchange your scripts data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use dcop; which should lie each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable the executing of external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; is mostly called to be called dcop &gt; relatively easy to use. here, an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends notifications to all current scripts. for this reason scripts will be able to monitor their default settings and react appropriately to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to display the setup dialog. for storing and loading of the setup data each script needs to take care of each script. when a script is started, Amarok uses the file folder to the stewards where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is played. the script might now ask & zb; with DCOP functions further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the pitch length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signals an amendment to volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuclicked: submeritemTitle: Contains the path to the selected files of playlist if a user-defined menu entry can be specified. to remove the menu you can use dcop amarok script addCustomMenuItem (subspecial itemTitle). to remove one entry, you can use dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (subspecial itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok branches off; or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. recording work. for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed by a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.bz2), which can be optionally available with bzip2 (.bz2), so users can clearly recognize the archive clearly as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3, only script packages will accept the extension of amarokscript. for this reason you should correct your script packages right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main critical review must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">When your script is completed, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and depend on the Wiki scripts page by & amarok; depend on your entry on KDE-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the kdelibs package and otherwise no further KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs have installed (including the programs contained, because & amarok; do some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD predicts that your window manager holds the relevant standards of freedestop.org. Gnome will work, but Fluxbox will cause difficulties for example. we try to support amaroK on all platforms, therefore we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will be able to make a mistake in the TagLib library. you can also see this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org and append the captive file that caused the crash. afterwards, you can delete the file and let the collection recreate again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is that Taglib will contain during reading the meta-information from this file crashing. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, then try SQLite. support for it in & amarok; is something more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & amarok branches; libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & amarok branches; with GCC 3.4, TagLib was compiled with GCC 3.3.x, then this leads to overthrow the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable the machine. switch off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least not a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is an frequently occurring crash and send us a good backtrace, the error has been fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many program write data as UTF-8 in meta-info, but these are not known as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions can be done before, you must make sure that & k3b is started. then, enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have common all & KDE; -program in common, supported & k3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP-interface from & k3b; features functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other features to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createAudio CDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () Void copydvd () Void burnCdImage () Void burnCdImage () Void burnCdImage (KURL url) Void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result, such a createXXXProject method is given a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternative to use the project via using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject With using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is applicable only on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) Void createFolder (URL:: List URLs, QString) Void addurls (URL:: List URLs, Qstring computing) Void ShoameItem (Qstring]) Void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring newname) Void setid (Qstring)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Therefore, it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT creamy / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; - Select for & KDE; with him can easily be stored audio CD; s read and be stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder of the computer installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (to read & CD; data in WAV files on hard drive) and many codiers to encode these WAV files (non-loss compression). more coils can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) is compressed to MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, read out the & CD; it is compiled by & kaudioCreator; almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coils are already present, so it is probably not necessary to compile something. if FLAC is not used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which codiers / file format is to be used? a small introduction about coils, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying of protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudioCreator: cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection. not to avoid the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid the purchase of copying protection. avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found), afterwards the daily use of information is found. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you will stumble on the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert many formats - depending on which code labels are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the FreeDb from the internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands of the main sequence. on the page Step by step example, you will find further information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB will start the CDDB file according to the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online, in the latter case, first the connection to the internet must be made.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts the read and - when a encoder was configured in the Code software tab - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the standard. it is to be noted that before the encoder board tab was configured in the dialog box dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so the file manager will encode you instead of using a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the kind of notifications (such as protocols, piepsen) for programming events (like reading the & CD; completed).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudioCreator; with different box cards (as Encoder, for setting the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coils, and compression rates, and helps you to choose the right Kodierator.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, there will be a lossless audio format. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'Monkey', which may possibly be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Using audio formats, lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most frequent. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower rate rates (up to 128 kbps), but about this bit rate will generate less important, since both coders are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt so 'free,' lame will still be supplied with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high quality sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at lower rate rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or a computer-based music system and / or when one of the few existing OGG files are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special Auto-stereo systems. today - early 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compressions for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency to most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of titles. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autostereographic facilities. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this attitude will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you have absolutely the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are entered manually or using the program automatically from the FreeDb program, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be handed / used in the program to create file and file names as well as the attributes of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms there is often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here. the manual or help to the coerers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; titles to be added if MP3s will be encoded with lame, the counter -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudioCreator: added. the result looks as follows: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button code in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the FreeDb is: a free database, in which persons can read / enter the information, so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself. it is said to be allowed only by text: & CD; titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal but I (Anm of the Ueberle) I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; no more or less worthless, so the information can not be added to the music company damage. all information can be combined with a Bummel by a & CD; business, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiodate; it is active in a checkbox address (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used in the system (this can only know the programmer, who has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiodate is set up; to use FreeDb, the geographical will need to be needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and is comparing the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of reflections for online retrieval of & CD; information about reading a & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually a month is created) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What your reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to be more precise, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD;. to note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first, if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving WAV files, the code can be selected and thus choose the desired file format. when opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compressing for audio data) can be added to the Code of the Code. other coders can be added to this tab tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiers package must be installed from the associated Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined coils. more information about Kodiers are in the chapter of the Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After the installation of a Kodierator, further information on the switch will be obtained via the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console), 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierator.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drives, write and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in one terminal. this could give a hint of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy of audio CD; check out. control the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to advance.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to establish those areas that do the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, starting everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write permission on it (eg; by trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section handles the basic set of & kaudiodate;, something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the preview to read a & CD, which has to be repeated for each insufficient & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the code quality (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps) and which structure will be used. since we are lazy, we share the program to download the FreeDb around the & CD; data from the internet download.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to read it out of a & CD while once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device model will be delivered to the reading program to read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this can't work or if more than one & CD / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to use the entries for the file names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">General settings. here are not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined here. in our example, everything will be shown / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Please select only for incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information is missing from keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card-card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & cd to download the Internet from a FreeDb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected during reading & CD; it can be connected to the Internet, so that it can access the FreeDb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry found, immediately starts the read of the & CD; which is later unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filename or tag entries, can be easily changed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example it is further to be noted: if you want to manually use it manually, use the select button and FreeDb mode. however, you can use FreeDb locally on line mode. however, you can be selected using FreeDb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is FreeDb for FreeDb. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving & CD; information from the FreeDb server about the Internet. how do the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section about FreeDb. see everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to the website freedb.org and look after a mirror server in your vicinity. on this track, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both will work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls need the protocol 8880 standardly, there may be more happiness with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data to the FreeDb server. the first checkbox should be disable.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously permitted pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time in only one existing drive? parallel reading and encode? the author doesn't know, therefore try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; check out the last piece of play: check this on to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you cross this, then / must be specified in the file / file, if only space is available on another drive. if the field is not listed, the files will not be specified in the private folder. don't forget this folder, if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All so set as it is on the screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances, something has to be blown to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a adjustment for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted at need. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' Tagger for & KDE; in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the names of the input file (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Do the rest like in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of encoded WAV files: at a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiodate; this configuration is used as standard for each out of a & CD; used. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, it is described as the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, which is organized on hard drive, as we want to collect MP3 files. first, a connection to the Internet, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data of the FreeDb will be able to pick up. the process that is described in this section will be repeated for each insufficient & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD, you don't have a bit different from FreeDb, you will see the screen photos from a little different from FreeDb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of fetch them out of the internet. comments are shown on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not attempt to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD has to be released in the drive which has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and accessed by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then search in the section questions and answers to the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up from the FreeDb, all tracks are completed and are also shown by the artist's name and album.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there will be a window appears, and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best for your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not selected the checkbox for the automatic query of FreeDb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, but the data from the internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - input the CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the play in the first line of the line 'actuator title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered at the input field 'Aktuell title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments. the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from FreeDb, the CD editor is not empty, but it's always a good idea to review the content of the CD editor, so you can not only begin with the artist and album names (e.g. all words with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of one piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you have ID3v2 tags; this option is set up on the tab menu settings; take a look at the tab 'Basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coils or file formats. see the help to the code to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select one entry, which is obviously with the style of an extension CD; this example is not important because we don't transmit the & CD, anyway. for more information, go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album is already filled with the called data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the date printed on any case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and procedure to the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from FreeDb. it is already sorted into one of these categories.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. notice that the artist and the album will be shown on the play list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check sign before each line of a piece. only the titles can be selected as marked. make sure that all pieces are selected, or get the button to select all pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the button selection. read the reading process, so this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we'll take a look at the window with the entries and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">On the tab, click on the switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you see if you are trying to work with a code that have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target file are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have writing access to the temporary files and target file?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have one new entry: order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into format MP3. so check out and code in parallel. notice the status information in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and encode. at most powerful machines the result is unclear. the computer used machine with an amd64 seems to have no problem when simultaneous interpreting and encoding (of course two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window appears.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioCreator;, you need & KDE; 3.x and 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece will automatically start when you pull it on the & kmid; -window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then play each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece is set off, you can jump to any place by using the medium mouse button and drive along with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right the speed display, and so the speed speed can change. to re-get the original speed, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the button, or selecting the menu entry break in the menu, thus interrupts playback. get the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; play reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in one music piece. some pieces use text events, others use lyrics and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set up what events are to be presented and even better: the event type is selected automatically, so you will not have to manually setup the entry automatic text code. however, you will always have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up a event type, select from the menu settings the entries text events or song events. same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are set up in this section as you can efficiently use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To put a collection, first open the collection manager. here you will find in the menu collection below the point. click here on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set up the diaries on the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into the temporary collection all songs, which you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. read the if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, she has to add to the collection manager. there, you can add the button to add a song. again, it appears the file dialog, with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic adding is enabled, a piece of opening (open to file open or drag & drop) will be added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic adding to the collection is not activated, it will be activated and emptied the temporary collection at opening a piece. this collection will then be added to open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the section following from the sub-menu sequence of the menus, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list above the Karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the button arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump a song, select the button in the previous piece, the entry predefined piece from the menu or press the button arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To erase a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection, and click the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, as it is saved when leaving & kmid; it is not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that understands synthesizers.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of type Change patch to Bright Piano in terms of the change patch patch to Trumpet and thus can always sound a trumpet if you should play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all Soundcards are GM-compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite column).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications to play a piece of play.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. requirement for this is that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... End Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap"... End Define KEYMAP "Another keymap..." End Define CHANNELMAP... End options... End</seg>
<seg id="1659">They see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and end that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as e-mail to allow me to come in future versions of & kmid; support can offer devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section is indicated how the patches of General MIDI can be displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to lay all the sounds that supports this instrument (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a plumber. for this purpose, you can carry out the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">If so, if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (the drum code), it takes a patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is contained in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch included, with each tone a different percussionist instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one that means the sound level of the same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how tones can be displayed on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keyboard for each channel and each instrument. you have to use different names only in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form tones on the percrate canal. check out the supplied keynote as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to change some channels on others. if you want to change the first and the second channel, do it simply in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the perkussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices require 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is depicted on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the corresponding keyboard must be defined further in the file. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example, to always use the wiper-patch on the perkscreen channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio, in which relationship Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied by the value, it will be converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used so that there is no decimal number in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is giving a keyboard to play a pitch-Bender Event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards will try to play two sounds up to an octave above. in order to try the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings. you can find it in the menu, settings, point MIDI settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole range of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on these pivatures you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the canalview to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can choose an instrument, the button does not make more green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canalview (until now) has two different views to display the played tones. in the menu, select the Settings menu below the item KanalView: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD displays speed, which is played with a song. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so, for example, find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the speed, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. that can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same scores in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can do not force, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to solve the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I'd like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, that's why & kmid; Drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror;, choose all files and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Automatically disable the setting of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can get the arrow button on the left from the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the tempo, click the LCD double-click.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & KDE; -Desktop with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or listen (if I want to play a karaoke file) or if I want to play a file, merely go to the & Konqueror; change the window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only, without using it to a collection, turn the setting automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you just want to play the first file. so, put the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then, do you complete, also B.mid and C.mid to play and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear this song or see the postcard, it animated me to program on & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me feel happy, write to me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or similar @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really enjoy a huge cheer when you send me a postcard from your home town or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, but if you want to send a MIDI file, but you should contact me when I have the file already.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I highly recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card. it's not the same if you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu bookmark, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries you should use after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchists. if you have an entry, his group and all his subgroups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked record.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', TV and continuous playlist may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that, but also by using the application itself. just click on a name of a category clicks, on the menu view, and as next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content is displayed this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to be selected from the menu with playlist and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when editing mode or any other group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on using the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during boot and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change of [General Options] No intro = 0. if the option is not available, it can be inserted simply.</seg>

<seg id="1726">That always has taken a pre-given backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if this has been identified), this must be done by manual change in the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only work XVideo (probably this type of playing video equipment under Linux is the only works). this is why the video forlinux extension is required for the X server. this is why the XFree86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1775">With the call of & kile; two selection options are available: 1. the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and legend of the settings. 2. this document may be written with the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parenthesis on the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the characters [12pt] specifies the font. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code is entered, the latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to this is the use of the volume building or of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before the compilation. & hurry; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compiling of the document, should be sought in the logging according to errors. when using quick assembly, & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, it should also be considered the logging.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document. for example, a report with the font size is 12, and only a few images should have a different scripture. the\\\\\\\ Huge and\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>

<seg id="1782">There are many possibility to read the ability of readability and usability of the document. there are, for example, certain types of fonts, fat pressure, cursive pressure, subdivisions, etc., these commands are either connected to the\\\ 'command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Directory {emph}: this command is available for the curative printing and is long as long as it is closed, until he is closed with a\\\ '{emph} or another environment. one single word in one sentence can be displayed in a set of\\ emph {word}.</seg>

<seg id="1785">After writing the source code with the & latex pattern; shown in the background, follow a step-for-step guidance for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once the wizard was entered a bit text, a few adjustments for the improved readability of the document should be completed. to this end, a quote from a few places in the fat and cranial print and a poem went to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor-view or Ctrl E can be turned back to the editor (in the internal viewer). in an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi edition such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF -converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, these are the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed using file (in the viewer) (unless the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar convinces the conversion of DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; -source code has been created, the conversion can begin to split other formats using the button PFE in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The front search for the direct jump from the editor for the added position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& hurry; offers a corresponding adjustment for all & latex; -binary files. only Modern under Settings Kile set up... tools Bauen are balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to carry out the desired search, the mouse pointer in a line of source code needs to be clicked on, close to front-search engine. the leap to the appropriate place in DVI; -viewer is done then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document of & kile; open and to the appropriate line. this must be set & kile; available in & eyepiece (default settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick construction of & DVI; viewer doesn't open, there may be an error. if a bug is required, this will be displayed in the logishable file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logishable file also accounts for error source in the source code. in the editor, the text file will always be able to view the error message in which the error message appears. in order to view flawed line, it must be clicked and hurry; jump to error message.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as the button on the tool bar is clicked, a window appears on the selection of using template for the document. the pre-set values are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">With a selection of empty document, a document can be used either by reason to re-written or the assistant to create a new document. further information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Current users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, it must be created either an existing & tex; - / latex; file open or a new file. & kile; can create a new template based on an existing document and selection of file from a document.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Creating a new document from a template using file New will be replaced by some strings through other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">For creating its own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables will be replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering document class. typically, it will be used as the following:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to creating a template is the use of the wizard and thus verbose to the commands in the editor. once the document has been made to this way, the following steps have been accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">By creating a new document, its own template, instead of the standard, can be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; -files created. will be a simple way to create a template, should be searched after one on the Internet, and that can be followed under the steps described below.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of user and serves for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can look out of the list of team members who he is. this happens by telling the Team Member from the list and expresses the button Setze. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold as you are: text.</seg>

<seg id="1939">Event promotions are actions that are carried out if something specific in the project is done. an example would be the draw of opening and closing of the project, so much someone worked, or the sending of a message when a file is secured, or a script that plays a file to CVS as soon as it is added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes to detect different types of files. using the default, the default configuration can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character coding: the encoding of newly created, or in other ways, to open files (where the encoding of the file can be overtaken). this attitude will be emitted by the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this attitude will be emitted by the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; created regularly backup copies, so that in a power outage or crash when the next start of the program can be restored. this is not the same as storing the file. even not stored documents will provide a backup regularly, according to the set time, created.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the edit area or own view (or documentation in a cardboard) that makes it possible to watch the documentation, preview, and source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1971">Component in the "Only-Lese" mode: verify that the plugin refused to be denied. only-lese-kParts usually refuse to loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: is this activated, then test & quantaplus; whether the given information is correct, then if the plugin is not available, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting is fully newly developed. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept has been implemented, which allows various implementations of plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only a plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a matching debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the button options next to the Debugger plug-in select button, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debug is enabled, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the variables displayed by monitorate variables is displayed. normally, it appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view, in which all holding points, listed with line numbers and conditions listed. usually appear in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (like in HTML) is shown in the Debugger. normally, it appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the Debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to Debugger, if necessary, manufactured, or she shares the plugin to listen to debit needs. this promotion is triggered by default if a project is opened, that must not be respected in normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger Session starts the session. closes the connection to the Debugger or terminates the leaves according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP requirement to the server for a Debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Points the debugger with the execution of the script and to send information on the monitoring variables as well as the current run line will be continuously. if this happens when the script has started, the script will start before a debug requirement is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points the debuggers to start with the execution of the script, without informing any information related variables and the current line number. if this happens when a script has been given, the execution starts, as soon as a request is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger introduces the next instruction in the script, without entering the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger introduces the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and includes inwards.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points the debugger to go over and go to the next, as if there was not the current.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog box, which can be entered into a variable, or an expression that will be monitored. the supervising value will appear in the variance view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialogue, one variable can be entered or a new value to a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; skills such as car completes and scripting rooms. their simplicity and flexibility makes up & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developer, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are in two types, family 1, the market-up languages and family 2, the script languages and the tool bars. day folders include two file types, the tag languages and the tool bars. tag files are handy, symbolised bodies of image crisps (above the Editier window), add text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details of converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to create, then the & descriptionrc; and also tool bars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and layout, the & quantaplus; for the day the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars allow a quick insert of tags in a document without any danger of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Day folders are nothing like folders. they only contain the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag files are available in the name of the application language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declared whether they are necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is wise to use as many users to use a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes any element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is set in simple manner.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only be found once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than just one element.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; one argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type class. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. gives the name of the class to where this method is. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a mere element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute of a tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it features the name and type of attribute. additionally, it contains additional tags that should be displayed as this attribute shall be displayed, etc; This is an only element-element element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source codes for the attributes in day-editing dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to meet the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology name within & quantaplus; used to achieve data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a cutting edge and a methodology name. the arguments that will be passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag assigned the elements of a list together. it can only occur to an attribute. it is a only element-element element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the attribute context of a tags within a dialogue. this day can only occur in a dialog only once (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Gives the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags. this element is a mere element.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is a mere element.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files are to begin with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML Version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0-8? &gt; and must be properly sealed and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention to & and & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML file, the tools can start up in the & quantaplus; -window to start and check TagXML. a further dialogue will appear, whose simple instructions is to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, verification takes place only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, an example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; -ELEMENT from the & W3C; & XML; scheme. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, an example for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP file will be described. the file name of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML Version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via DTD edit DTD settings. in order to edit a & descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be prepared with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Ude 1 for & quantaplus; Version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not indicated, the name is nicknamed as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A promotion can set up actions with actions... and will be created. click on New Action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This promotion has proven key-escalopes. with clicking on the user button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with Kone, the current keyboard is remote.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the determinated settings and inserted this text in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but on that it is not limited), which can change the document or use as input (or parts of document), themselves are the quickstart dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir / myScript.sh. this way tries to find the script in the following places: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in the case of a local document, file names will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP used to control & quantaplus; by external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, normally the filename of current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script can input from & quantaplus; at default input. in the selection box input can be determined, which is to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected field of document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this attitude.</seg>
<seg id="2037">Accordingly, the output of the executed application can be redirected. there are two types of issue: normal edition, on the default error output. it can be specified, which should be done with the default issue written on the default issue, by default the output range is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the market-up language, it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own tool bar. in the case there's not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure actions. select attitudes are set.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts to edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes does and you use their use, enable you to edit dialog "Tag," if available, allowing you to use a entry when using the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should note the action in conjunction with this symbol? will we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better, we will use & kiconography; choose from the & kmenu;, graphics, other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconese; used by default 32x32 pixel, we need 22x22. to change this, choose edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green, usually be interpreted, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user signals that clicking this tool is a & lt; starting in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and put them on with other tags, so there are, or confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some usual & quantaplus; functions for tool bar add or it should adjust this to a better overview by some separator in multiple groups. open the toolbars to set up dialog on toolbars. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the Trenner (on the left above) for my tool bar. after selecting the element, add the arrow button to the right. this adds an element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview a quick way to access the queror preview. I will select it and add the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separator support the grouping. someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the & Konqueror; button is the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by sampling all symbols in order to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the correct file. after NeueXML does not exist, it is laid impedited, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct file. please fit their & descriptionrc; so on that their tool bar (s) is loaded when a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language that you like to like. this is why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document preparation for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in the & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to select an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. language. then you will need to create the docrc file. first, we will let you let the second treat us here.</seg>

<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention and & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; ressources can be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the section of the docrc file, which is to be displayed on the design of context-sensitive help. for example, if writing the function named and press of Ctrl; H for context-help would display the documentation directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and file-binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of using separate context-elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can store your file docrc simple and instantly save for $HOME / .kde / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or copy / quanta / doc or copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth it, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to use the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the resources (DTEP packages, tool bars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners, or else to whom. at different locations there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, list files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our head archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can be reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and usable for release. in order to make a useful contribution, it is guaranteed to provide a useful contribution, for our team as well as for the later user.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When upload, you are asked for your private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can continue to check the input fields filled (URL-preview) and by clicking OK the uploading can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the upload DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbars can instantly upload, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource through the integrity and signature. in the case of problems, it may then be aborted. if the integrity have been given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the information about the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not made by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be done simultaneously by using a DTEP package as necessary. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD package into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD store and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. afterwards the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target group name: the newly created & DTEP; is written by this name into the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitive line: the string that will appear in! DOCTYPE day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd will appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; according to conversion & descriptionrc; editor, can be adjusted with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to be able to understand and put full benefits from & quantaplus, this chapter one must first teach them with these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projects related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; it is available, available in common folder structure of & quantaplus; it is possible to secure the group of administrators of various tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to each in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user directory, so they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a certain project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns can be set up to work files specifically for the files of a particular project. simple, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder-tree of the project, which makes the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project em√∂glicht.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the building views, the boxes with information and the tool bars. please drop in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Clicking with the right mouse button, click to get a context menu with the current document suitable to recharge, delete or upload the document, jump, or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS command to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the EditorArea to create a further context menu regarding the working document content, such as basic machining steps (cutting / copy / insertion), processing the file under the mouse pointer or open the file, when the string below the mouse pointer file is called a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the Editorfensters are the tool bars of the editor. at the moment, & quantaplus exists; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool bars are shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and thereby associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; pgt; in their document, then click on the data for this just one day. if you want to include a day that has multiple attributes (as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The manners (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, open and pass through. in the presentation with cartonreitators stand for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation designs available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or delete the files from the storage medium can be carried out with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc; it is open to you all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; working range from. global templates are always available, local templates only use for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project. more about templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting in Global, Local and Project works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information on a script. further functions are available, such as the script will start to edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. the cursor in the document is placed on the position of the element. by right-click of an element, a list of commands in terms of navigation and refractures of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other fields of construction. with it, various attributes and namespaces may change. the modification of all available attributes can be made with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development. it can be downloaded here documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'document site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cartons on the bottom end of the window, can be reached via the usable information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map displays information about each in Quanta-running script. for example, the current DTD is displayed and all changes to DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carton display shows all errors in the market up of current document. & quantaplus; scripts that will be executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the tool bar is the opportunity to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with e-mail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar-Archive by & kmail; if they have a tool bar in an email, they can backup them in & quantaplus; like any other and charging!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It's reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the & quantaplus; it has a number of options to be handed over to the configure script. in order to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting at boot & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin file. also, you should ensure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH before it's folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what would happen if & quantaplus; an independent, extendable market-up languages? well, this would make him the absolutely brilliant web development tool for & KDE! so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer available on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantaplus; therefore the suitable & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be kept, that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; report is not only this possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can extend the productivity almost every task. through self-knitting actions, scripts and tool bar, the automation can be able to memorate them. (more about it you will find in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been conceived for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed release and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / quanta run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file, which is not on it, the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check out in the section about templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project preference folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted to inserting from the clipboard there are special characters to & HTML; -scripts, so that it displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -aphrase, which is the correct way to insert special signs and spaces in & URL; it is primarily used to insert & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">This allows you to select the block selection. it allows you to select text blocks with the help of & Shift; button to select.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error message appears!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Looks for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and pre-defined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the message window or not at. this is the window, in which you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Exit and enrollment of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; the problem journalist is activated once you are changing to Structured tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol-old left from the main window. this column allows you to set Bookmark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with entries to previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks of other open documents appear in the menu grouped after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables, to copy files into your project folder or sub-folders and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load files in your project on your server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules (Kio Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. chapter & quantaplus; projects can be explained in details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project tool bar. these are stored in the project you / toolbars and are only available in this menu, if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of tool bar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens up a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be stored using settings actions or are asked to store the toolbars, whether you want to store the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the visible range. this does not extinguish them from the hard disk. if you have not stored the toolbar, you will ask if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send their own tool bar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -Team, so the tool bar is available in the next release). the menu entry will open a new email message with the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows to upload tool bars on the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; which you or anything else has done and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / reloading of the entities from the & DTEP; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP exists; if this is global and an write permission in the global KDE file fails, the shop fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently charged tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day evaluation dialog, if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivates the intelligent insert of tags. currently this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. smart input means that & quantaplus may be refused to add the tool to this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-ins menu, the available plug-ins are listed below the listed menu points. click to click on. click on the activate plugins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Choose syndication mode for the current file. the list of available utility schemata depends on derafate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD option; by external use Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate shutdown between the different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch can sometimes need time or unnice graphics. it is recommended that the card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which is the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains a entry for each open window. with a selection of an agreement, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Shuts the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main sequence on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialogue contain any application that use the HTML Part, including the & Konqueror; web browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Address the behavior of the Editorfenster. in the Documentation of & Kate, you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you delete entries from the toolbars, or add what can be done and the sequence will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should produce an aid according to the mouse pointer's environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled in the best from top to bottom, as for example, after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project automatically completes. all these paths and author information fields can be stopped later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example foo. in the input of name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, except you are processed local data. either a name (hostname.com.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen log file will be used. depending on the remote computer adjustment it could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this file should be set rather than standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the file, where the tool bar is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this file should be set rather than standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or whole files can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This attitude is great, if you have static web content you want to download and change. if scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Accused, if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project are supposed to be integrated. if a project is started to re-start, do not haze.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of vouchers.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files through anchoke or, by removing the ring, from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that can simplify your work. these settings can be instantly upload with project properties in the menu frame in the menu window, or using the SHIFT Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings are in the project assistant and are described in. additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder possible), which will be newly modified for project-related operations such as project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, including files that are listed in .cvsignals are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be loaded when opening the project, can be read more about project prospects.</seg>
<seg id="2172">In order to be selected the desired debuggers. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set with the button options. in case the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the bottom window profiles, high load profiles (see in) may be set as well as the display of a building-view for the content of the server for each profile, setting a separate construction view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the Team window configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the sub-window event configuration, event events can turn-off and add these actions, change or erase. event actions are carried out if a certain event occurs, such as the sicknesses of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. you can not influence this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar. the dialog can open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus will be closed, the project file will be stored automatically. you will ask if you want to save changes before leaving, when & quantaplus; changed files. same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project management provides free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be stored in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave similarly, but are missing the entries to open and open... in the right mouse button, open-text menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information on the site of highly admissible files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blinded to prevent removing the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten. this option is useful if frequent upload files is necessary, and the rather unsafe password of the record -option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog, if you change your opinion in front of the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. to edit or creating a profile, this dialogue will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to the files. either a qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Port for transfer. usually this must not be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it to your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it can't be easily read, but each with programming language can be easily seen in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and tool bars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple numb of view, various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu, or the project tool bar, accessible via the toolbars project tool bar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; in their own working mode.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, the toolbars in & quantaplus; at best about the menu toolbars. use and adding differs. adding toolbars is treated in the section Add workplaces.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bars and symbols can be set either via the context menu (right click on the tool bar), in which you can remove other actions such as tool bar, tool bar rename or toolbars can be implemented, which will be visible in the dialog, which actions on this or other tool bars are to be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a tool bar, in addition the entries will remove and action performed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up on them in the menu with toolbars... and set the settings....</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are contained in the essential documentation, code escalopes and files. you can copy, postpone or any most common file system with extended organisation and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any of the system existing directory in the storage space. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you imagine for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their application. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using linings (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are found in the storage space under global templates. for more information on the templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be made from any text documentation. on the basis of this templates, new documents can be created. normally a simple scaffold for the purpose and organises the work in appropriate manner to be efficient. some examples can be found in the storage space under global templates. see for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted into documents. you can find everything from a comment via a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl based. some examples are found in the storage space under global templates. see for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, this templates for all the sites are templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, together in a compressed tar Archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure after exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file as a template as a local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, notice that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the project tree under project management.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File as a template to save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and print on the construction-view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file only can copy into a template folder. all file management functions can be used for use, such as pulling and dismantling or insert the file-tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a file right in the file-tree or in the project files Baumanviews on a folder right and secure site template, select a name for the template and secure. by default, it can be saved in the project file, but of course it can be saved as a local or global model.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project developers enable a highly-oriented approach to date. you can add head lines and footlines or connect dynamically with & PHP; in addition, you can insert some things when using templates in projects very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the sub-window templates is based on the files set in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / merge / apps / quanta / templates / template / template / template or templates. each of these folders equals one of four types of containers such as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of an folder, click the folder overview of the folder and select the text menu properties tab. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A select field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded, once elteristic attributes can be disputed.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapts for everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a regular folder would be disable, unless they appear explicitly. in case of a normal folder the blah would appear with something like text structures. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a regular folder.</seg>

<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source code editor that can be reached via the menu view. the first mode will replace the editor window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editing functions as follows: he loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and cursor will appear. then you can edit and when needed to the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL can be displayed in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editing on a document that & PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohandension of & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editing & PHP; it is still necessary to change the source editor. there are no plans to change these behaviourings.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that the changes are displayed both in the source code and in VPL. editor synchronous. with pressures of F9, this mode is already active, this mode is already active, the button transfer the active cursor from a window to others, whereby the position is kept in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quanta.... It can be set between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendations can be set. in principle, the recommendation is required: a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the processing of invisible tags is possible at work with the VPL; editor is also called upon as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editing is used to change the hanging of the hanging body. this is how to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information on the document themselves, i.e., buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. key words on the column name and key word key wort2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the creation of pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with buttons under the list or erase. a change about the list is possible, just as with the meta-elements. the adaption of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert an external CSS styling template by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is like in a word word, due to the arrows, possible. in rare circumstances, the cursor position is peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and delete a distance or distance.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is made in the same way over the toolbars, such as in the source code editor, and it is said to consider that the insertion of tags have already existing identical tags, e.g. an anchor tag, is surrounded by text, each other surrounds an anchor tag must be removed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes, and at the same time it corrects a lot of changes at the same time. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within this lines. and there was no clues on the places where perhaps only the remuneration was changed. the merger of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences in line and changes to white characters. later, lots of further useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you would like to compare text, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful if two people can work independently from each other than one piece of codes and make changes. the original file (the basis) helps to edit both correct changes. in this Editor, you can also edit the results directly. in this Editor, you can also edit the result even directly. the screen photo shows three Quell files in merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the same and merging complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and user interface to the options of current colour monitors. if you often need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no annoyance if anyone changes the remuneration.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other distinguishes in one line, then the colour indicates that the file varies. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same names, but in different folders, you can facilitate the tipments by using only the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder, folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual encoding of filenames, the selection via the file browser (file...) or selecting a last-opened file from the folding list. the opening dialogue will give you a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, you will use the same or merge folders. if you select a file, it is used for B and C but use a file, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is crossed, the input field is active for the target and can be done. however, it is not necessarily necessary to establish an output file immediately. you can do this step later during stores.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set the options before you start with the default / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard in the active comparative window. compared to opening dialogue, you don't have to select files, you can simply complete the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and dismantling: simply drag a file from one file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall on a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you would like to find out how similar these functions are, it would be quite a relatively large effort. you would need to load two corresponding files, and then compare it. now you can copy the relevant sections simply, add and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can draw nothing out of & kdiff3; only release text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and placing text into another program as cutting and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such a case your original data could go lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and line number of the first visible row in the window. (if the path is too long, leave the mouse to rest for a while. then, a small relief window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three springs are the letters A, B and C are assigned. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (this default may be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, one sees in the color that distinguishes itself. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in settings). the colour scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summarizing column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding colour. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessors and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the combination column from the text, is interrupted in the digits, where the case file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is shown on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (under the comparison list) also has a info-line with the inscription:, the file name and [changes] if you have the results. usually it contains text, but often contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! up to all conflicts are disbanded, the store is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to execute the most solved / unresolved conflict around the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed in all windows, where the group will not be visible.) This group will then produce the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and each on the left is a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic merge or by manual processing, no further line remains in the group; then it will be displayed in these lines of text & lt; no row in the queliness. this text will not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you may copy and add wodifferent.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; Conduction-follicates; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the results window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when choosing the sources to ignore or Ignore C / C + + Comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly to the mouse running and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can also use the arrow keys to the right, right, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl finish, siw as well as you can also use it from other programs. by clicking on, you can also click here to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye-window, you can also use the other keys to edit. you can switch between insert and transfer mode. (default setting is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button, synchronizes the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group (as already explained in the section) and the editable window window was declared.</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-bottom / Strg-above), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Image upward / Ctrl-Image) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, all undissolved conflicts are still considered to be a conflict. therefore, between dissolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking in the clipboard, you have to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insert). if this is enabled, you will be copied automatically into the clipboard and copy the manual copying. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the content of the clipboard accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line breaks are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. UNIX variants use a line-in delay\\ r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and reproduced during the next start. (menu setup - &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a script with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides writings with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic writings. if the chosen font does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be framed. in these systems, the button preferences automatically displays an odd colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tabulator button. otherwise, there is a tabulator sign.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or Return, the backward line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be copied automatically into the clipboard. manual copy into the clipboard is then deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to store. the default value is the usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files are tried & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines to the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters will not be ignored. also, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car replenishment '\' at the end of a line, other again store only one line-up character '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the car-back sign, but then you could be treated with different sizes on the side-to-side comparison, but if this option must be disabled, however, this option must be disabled. in default, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis numbers and related signs ('0' - '9', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'. ', but they will be shown as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automated mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before going to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatically all conflicts in white characters using the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if you need to ignore it only from time to time, then use better the features W√§hle A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection can also ignore conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in chapters to scanning and merge and merge the merge. look for details under documentation on the directory and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the Suffix .original file. if already one such backup file with the Suffix .original exists, this will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting the language of the user interface. changing this option does not match the current program. you must quit and restart the change. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally through the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Via the radio fields for the encoding, a short notice what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file code for source files. this influences how special characters can be treated and interpreted as the code for each file is individually adjustable, can compare files with different coding and be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can define what coencoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define output commands, they might not be able to function with your codec. (e.g., your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the processing command can only use 8-bit ASCII.) With this option, you can define the coding of output command devices.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off to suppress the alterations of changes in white characters in the text or instructions. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options are ignoring or Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences are displayed in a colour coded oversizing column. but sometimes you want to see only the differences between two of three files; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal even a second transitional column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen better for long rows. simply enter the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window. this can also be useful for displays of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide how to merge the files. current file merge and use the file name file as default. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be given first to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own label processor, which is exactly your requirements. you can use this function e.g. for removing disturbing parts or correction.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will be given first to this external command (see above), then the output of command will be used only at the line. you can write your own label processor, which corresponds to your requirements. every input line must have a corresponding edition line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable the user to enable more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program needs to program, and most users don't want to program that. good news is, however, in most cases sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command to convert the input into large letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use a few key words to automatically add character strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). therefore, the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed experimenting, you may begin to understand and perhaps you may like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignore of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line compensation. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Each one hit, and each item is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several ardiscourses at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the reactions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use something different such as perl -p -e -e -s / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allerdings are different from perl some details. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '.</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to normal pre-processor are maintained for viewing and merge. the further operations change the data that the line-off Algorythmus sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal pre-processor, the line-of-preprocessors can be used as input from normal preprocessors as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences may be hidden, you accidentally not notice certain differences and destroying important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files. for this reason you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... making a proposal for each object; you can adjust the suggestion forward,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without them really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... requires selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merge of individual files. you need to file only folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three files are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no target file is specified, file specified & diff3; folder 3 as target file.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will not start the merge. to start the merge, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow).</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress. if you stop scanning the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the button or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions, open all subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you click on a file, the file is started and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in column Name reflects the file type in the first file (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation can not be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C, colors red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the colour is identical, even if the number of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered the same as the same content is identical. then, folders are the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant in its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colours of a sheet again, which is only green, then yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, extinguishing the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, extinguishing the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, extinguishing the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. when A folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B have not have the same file type (e.g. when A folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronize mode is active if only two files and no explicit target file were specified, and if the option will synchronize directories. then, choose & kdiff3; the necessary action so that the two folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for output file only B; copied directly after the merge, copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two files are merged, then select the new file instead of merge (unsecure), then check the correct file for copying. if the files are different, but the date is identical, but the date is identical.. Solange are not eliminated, the merge may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, one file is working according to the other. it status column shows fertig when the merge was successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected can be completed, you should check out a final review and see if the status is alright everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If set up the file comparative method Full analysis, Kdiff3 will show further columns. these include the number of unresolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for deleted conflicts is displayed only when three files are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge either the selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have chosen all together-sensitive actions (also in all subfolders), you can launch the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target file, then in the three-file-merge mode, C will be used as target, when using two-folder merging, B and / or B is used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have chosen a target file, please check if all entries should be displayed in the target file, even in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped through certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To put all the entries: select directories and start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to run only the current entry: select support of the current Elements or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If using conflicting data types still invalid interactions, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you summarize all entries, a dialogue window with the options run, simulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you would like to see what would happen without the real changes. you will then receive an exhaustive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (merge a single file), then a merge window opens. (please note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are done with a file, select again directories, proceed or press F7. if you haven't yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; check out a mistake, a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you choose the cause of the problem. so you have the opportunity to select another action for the entry, or proceed to the problem, before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually merged, these entries (in the current session) and leads them to the future together. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be done as done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3 setup...) now has a section called on-line merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered several patterns. separate space holders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default *. folders don't have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a partition. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a partition. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that will also be ignored by CVS. many autmatic files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this file can be specified using a .cvsignore file. (look under info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have an accid attribute. in other file systems, a predefined point is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In links to folders: if the option is switched off, the links like normal files are dealt and recursively. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recurts), a link to the link to itself would lead to a final loop and crashes off.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of any file through and shows the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unobatic, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files, which contains no text. (specify a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folder on a slow network, it may be faster to compare the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security. please be careful with caution. this option is removed from default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidence of change date. there is no real comparison. these files are considered the same as the same. that can be useful when copying the change date. please be careful with caution. this option is removed from default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two files are compared and no target file is specified. in this mode the proposals are so selected that afterwards both folders are identical. this option is stored in both folders. this option is set off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences instead, instead of merge the copying of the newer file as action. (this will be considered uncertain because the other file is not changed, you should check this in any case.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a file is replaced by another or deleted, the original version is renamed and receives the extension .orig. if an old backup file is already exists, this will also be deleted without another backup. this also applies to the normal connection of single files, not only the merge of the file. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder-merge viewpoints are visible to the merge of single files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the window divider on the window menu and switch to change between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-click. however, in the directory menu you can also merge a single file, without the folder, use the file, and the file will not be handled once more, if you run the folder together.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status goes lost if you want to read the directory again: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of Kio-slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file using a FTP server. the second command line compares a file within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. some things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undone. or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special signs have to be mashed. (# - &gt;% 23, idle &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes, due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or a folder. then, a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions or change-date. hence, soak the permissions or the change date from the original. (please note the option of trust in size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main reason for use is currently as a difference viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop first starts the built-in differences viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button about the difference viewer and then choose In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a part, it takes up & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, the program patch starts to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the queror, you can click on a patch file and select from the pop-text preview in - Kdiff3Part. please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparing two files, a very small tool bar and menu. it does not support the merge or the same file sharing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it is comender) already exists. furthermore the name Kdiff3 is already pointing out that it can merge how the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by using in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers that are gone or going to go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and should not find the right PREFIX to KDE. in the default, you can't find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file, you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters different is different, these lines are first treated as the same; but if only a non-white sign is different, the line will be treated as not identical. iF similar lines for next to Each other, this is the case this is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noticeable for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends. that's necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C, and it's too much effort to design extra a file format that could store these information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was too large so far. you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit a larger quantities on text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src left; released and the text cannot erase. what does it mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already many colors are used to emphasize differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3 functions, you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information you can use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3 sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & install on a system with & KDE; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir is the file installed in your system where the KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should have no problems with compile. if difficulties occur, please report on the & KDE; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or switch-removing) into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or switch-insert) add the text from the clipboard at the current curve position and replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are shown: files identical in all folders are not included in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target file.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you must review the folder the folder with the function Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries shown that these files are not included in the target file. if the target file does not contain these files, they are missing after the merger. (the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons on selecting the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the appropriate window are attached to the end of the selected group (if they are not already available). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. underdifferences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual working areas. it is quite practical to change the ongoing programs on the working areas to change their size, or move it. this works both within a desk and with multiple.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual environments as well as the applications running. applications can be selected and even moves on your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the medium mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager. the movement is possible both within a desk and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when on the empty background of & Kpager; click on the application and the use of application as well as entries, maximize, maximize your desktop and finish. the commands will affect the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on full size of mind. only appears when it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to select virtual desktop. only appears when it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this checkbox is marked, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; it can be moved with the middle laying on your desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & Kpager, the name of virtual work space is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field allows the & Kpager; the numbers of virtual work space is shown. if it is enabled, together with name, the names will be marked with ordinances, & eg; 1. mind.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise only the empty workspace is displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">The view of the program window is selected here. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the window with its standard symbol and pixels. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager can be determined: classic leaves & Kpager; in some other Windows managers, all virtual workareas in a horizontal and vertical range of applications can be seen in a vertical range, which is very good for the presentation of the side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager minirange in the control panel. it has the advantage that it can change in size that can display windows as symbols or with their content, and can also move outside the control panel.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & Kpager; and then select the switch settings... allows the dialog box to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the dialog box .You can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you have no write permission for the file, you must register the keys of windowTransparent mode and refer to this value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding around new features. it is optimised for use on high performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you & co may start, a window appears as top. the main window of & kmag; this window displays the enlarged area of screen. in the following, this window is displayed as a magnifying window. in the following, this window is displayed as a magnifying window. in the following is an enlarged range of screen and is described in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting increases & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a moving lung. alternatively, you can set a selected screen range in the magnifying window (selection selection mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the screen (eg; on the left).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse pointer in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note that & kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer, this is always the standard KDE; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the box window to your own needs. you can change it with the arrows and mouse button and change its size. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can shift the content of the magnifying glass and move. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you add the & Shift button; press the button or the MMB; use the button window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the radio button remain firm, and only the bottom right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer, copy into a file into the clipboard (to insert later into other applications), turn the picture and much more.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulated a mouse click, once the mouse pointing a while on the same spot. it is intended to help people suffering the repetitive strain Injury (RSI) syndrome, and that each mouseclick sore pains. this also requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool, can handle the pain that emerges by clicking the mouse, and helps to use so many people to assemble the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may seek pain using the use of your computer, you should see a doctor if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to clarify it even more: even if & kmousetool should avoid pain that are caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that is caused by the use of mouse, useless. and as with all the ergonomic aid: the result may vary for each differently.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click immediately when you break the movement short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent relocating, makes & kmousetool; a break after it is emulated the mouse button. in this way, you can execute the pulling of the bridled mouse button. the smart shift requires a little exercise, but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">After the end of the mouse movement, it must be enough, before & kmousetool to execute a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If it is enabled, the turnaround is switched on (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool is waiting, before the mouse button is waiting until there is no evidence of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now is activated by clicking on the mouse button. this function is activated, followed by a break, a click with the right button. these movements will be stored in the $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt file when the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can reduce the reaction time to reduce the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, choose sound system and here the tab. there is a sliding sound buffer, which you can set on a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & KDE; this function is currently only available under & KDE; please insert the respective documentation to determine how you start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings back to the values, which have been discontinued when opening the dialog. have you already pressed the button user, the settings are reset to the user's final pressing.</seg>
<seg id="2509">At best use & kmousetool, first with default settings. in particular, you should first use the intelligent shift to start off. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you'll later be able to push the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you are using the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times by & KDE; for shutters.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect remains: the click on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that doesn't pose a link does not lead to unintentional reactions. you can therefore use mouse in such places, until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is printed, you should clean your mouse. this is normally rather simple. the trick is that you do not only cleanse the mouse ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First of all, you need to take out the mouse ball. as that happens, mouse becomes different from mouse to mouse, but it should be quickly clear when you view the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the sphere, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole where the ball was used. the dirt and dirt can easily be scratched with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of & kmousetool. if you're just a move forward, it means that & kmousetool does not mean that the operation can no longer end by the letting go.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and postpone window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this is reset the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another spot.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor place where you want to have it. but do not use the mouse on a neutral area of mind, if you are using a key moments. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with smart moving, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is a more advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it, to copy it into the clipboard and want to add any other action at which you will probably cause some problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent distortion, if you just begin to start & kmousetool to use. select text instead as follows: take a mouse click to the other end of the text and keep the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always be played every time when & kmousetool. the mouse button flushes the sound like a mouse click. so you can also use the smart relocating without the audible mouse click. however, it needs some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use the Xtest extension for & X Window; this should be the case in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker, and set it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool, actuated the mouse button shortly after the mouse pointer shortly. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and those who prepare the beginner pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool, can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting that a pulling process begins, before the mouse button is let loose. in this way the pulling and dismantling can be carried out with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2622">In order to understand the work of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The edition of Screen-Reaars has the highest priority. it will be drawn to all other records and keep these orders. if the issue of screen Reader is read, orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news such as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning has priority and holds the output from messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next shelf priority. one news interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application to read the news. while you & eg; a long text on a website can be read with & kmouth; someone welcome you just enter the room. & KDE; -Notification are also news. read more</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order that you add from the card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that apply text orders. text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts that do not have special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queues, except the edition of Screen Readers. when an application sends the output of a Screen-Readers, while & ktts; just one such prereads, this issue will stop and terminate.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied on normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & KDE; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters work the text and put it on the next filter. at the time there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there can still be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character strings replace parts of a text by other text. you can replace them either as words or as regular expressions. it will be printed with pre-defined text ratings such as: -) through text or for the transformation of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understanding form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Transformer uses a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) around & XML; from a format into another format. in delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files to the translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaking selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text, or depending on the program that sent the text on & ktats; for example, if you have set up a female voice on the map of the map, you can read text by KDE messages about it. Siehe. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these various filter has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter does not apply that its rules does not apply, he will continue the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & KDE; alert on & ktats; sent, it will be machined by all activated filters, which have been set up on the page below. editing is carried out in order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the furnished normal filters. if a filter is not crossed, it is not activated and is not used. filter will be switched from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filters, and it will be displayed next below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Enter a list of words or regular expressions then you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions. will this pattern be exchanged in text, then the text will be exchanged against the associated spare text. large and small sample is considered compared to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Specify a name for your filter. you can choose from this name, it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string from the column. the list is checked in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expressions in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can upload a list of words or regular expressions out of a file, save the current list or delete a list from one file, the entries will be attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is registered here, the filter is applied only if the speaker for the text job offers one of the languages registered here. click on the button to view a list of languages. you can also hold multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl button.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can input several programs separately by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The applicability ID run programs will get you with the program qdbus;. the & DBus; numbers must be wedge. if for example & qdbus; the applicator ID copied-3432 will only be set.</seg>

<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. one news interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just a long text on a web site, you can agree with & kmouth; nevertheless someone welcome you just enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or copy of a screen-reader, add & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs submit text into individual sets. this can also be synthesized, as only the first proposition should be synthesized, not the whole text order. so you can also jump back or cancel, even if the language synthesizer does not support them directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts, you can automatically add a propositional detection filter automatically. you can add its attitudes to change or more propositional recognition filter, but will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the simplest way, you will learn the setup of speaking selection. check the map selection again, change the speaker selection again, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you have to have installed more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then start to read faster with the foreread, as only the first movement must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You will then keep text orders on the order ticket orders or can stop, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal propositional recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it can't be switched off, just removed. change nothing at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional detection filters compare text with a regular expression of propositions and include a tabular sign (Decimal code 8) to the proposition bordering (Tabimalcode 8). note that the standard-sentiment detection filter keeps the drawing level.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters never applied on & KDE; -News (s), warnings, news, or the edition of Screen-Readern.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal propositional detection filter, you can resign this again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map menu, you can overwrite the application settings for application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on board map). in other words: there are no knowledge properties defined.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the matching microphone, which shows all characteristics of the speaker. if you do not delete the settings of the speaker, select & dictts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker from, which corresponds to the most originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired speech characteristics by clicking on one of the select buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Choose the properties of the desired office. if this feature does not matter, do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this checkbox when the property should have priority from other features. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor at the default value, this property is rarely used as priority. you might use this property rarely. the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is ahead, if you know that a specific application form text in another language as the result of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the area, use the most likely to delete the following, click on the button button and then use on speaker, which correspond to the most below.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is set for the last text job in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input number is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately plunges when it is started. I compiled Debug support but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktats; it was probably finished. probably you have to register GStreamer. when the problem is not solved, possibly a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to upgrade or uninstall.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output of ALSA does not work when I play a text application, freezes & ktts; a message on the & console; appears a message that says: 'to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem exists that conflicts with ALSA are appearing, which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. hints for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the card audio, there is a setting speed. that this works, the program SOX is installed and can be connected via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers such as Festival Interactive can offer a adjustment for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the talk speed will be ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read either the filter for conversion of & HTML; after & XML; (see) or if you are totally brave, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -after-SSML deformations filter, and set up the speaker velocity.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't create that web pages are read with a female voice. I created a female festival speaker, but & ktts; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER does not work. so that festival is no error, the xsl file carries the converting of SSML to Saber the GENDER tags. the same applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a own character set filter and now I can go in & ktts; no longer a two or go back. on the carton orders will appear, the order will consist of a sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Intersection (point, question mark, clamation mark, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. use a filter for a propositional recognition for this sign instead.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop adjustments on a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed in & kcontrolcenter; it is displayed on the network settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in the & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware does not install. physical devices and their drivers have already been working and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device even displays and enables the setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices with installing and Linux; installed and installed. will network appliances added later, the drivers will need to be loaded using the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Settings module is loaded if the network settings are selected at the & kcontrolcenter; Index settings are selected, while the module's starting system is trying to automatically detect the platform used on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can't be detected, the hanging selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and Releasestand best. by checking the setting non-re-issues can be set permanently. during the next start of the network settings, then this selection will be preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings can only be displayed in system administration mode. previously, all settings are displayed, changing is not possible. in the system administration mode, you can enter the button management mode at the right end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The module's entire functionality is available in system administration mode. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The device network interface functions for the administration of the system network. all available network devices are displayed. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks are implemented:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings specified network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button and click on the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the click of Advanced Settings displays dialogue with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP information system sends all the required TCP / IP information at any system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, without DHCP or BOOTP can be carried out the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address, the required TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is marked, the system initialize the network interface in boats. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network. using an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can determine whether the required address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off. switching from a network device is done by selecting from the list and click on Interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off. turn off a activated network device through selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the IP address of the host in local subnet which is conveyed by the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the web in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A calculator with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer code http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator on the naming solution part of the Reiterequator solution enables simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed .DNS entries can be sorted by selecting a single application and lowering gradation in the list with buttons or herding in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Adding the button to add... from the group calculator to the naming solution a DNS server can be added. it will add the dialogue New nameserver.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the button Edit.... It will edit the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of well-known hosts describes host name-to-IP address files for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily with boats if no DNS servers are available. in small, enclosed networks can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list of well-known hosts contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this is still the same version of IP to replace in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer, and click Add.... The dialog can add new alias is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known computer and click the button. if the well-known machine has multiple alias names, press the button add several times, and enter another alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known computer manufacturer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Knowing Calculator is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then by clicking OK, the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings contained in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to enable the changes, the command needs to be set in a & Console; the following command needs to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage from & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net to download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distribution (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & KDE; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install in a & Console; with rpm, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & KDE does not satisfy, but additionally the development agenda with libraries and other things are required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended for users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile these commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given on fundamental network technology, in the second all of & knetworkconf file may be discussed; changeable configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area may not replace more knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the PC's integration are communicated into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great dissemination. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future. this description is currently concentrating on widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in other networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator the response position, which can be used as a valid IP address, or if available, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When selecting a own little (home) network, IP address from a specially reserved area should be selected to avoid IP address accounts with the global (Internet) network. addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, hence its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be possible through setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks mostly addresses are used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route will be required for the IP finishing line.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. usually, the address is assigned 127.0.0.1 on an own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files, which are specified by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file sometimes changed by DSL connections, so it is not surprised when there is no other content in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in sub-config. another stand as expected can occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a fuse program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it also offers the ability to create multiple archives on a band. the first goal was to answer a question for tar, which presented my wife: how much longer takes it when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; it can happen on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; keep the band back and reads the prestressing information of the tape. recognize & kdat; if you don't know the band, you will be asked whether the band will be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the credits are looking for the appropriate index on your record. cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol will change for the tape drive to indicate that the band is bound. in the Status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before discard the bandes, initially the integration needs to be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a change of the tool for the tape that the integration has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be kicked out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat it can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band maps must be formatted before you need to be used to store data. this process must not be formatted before use, but it must be formatted before using the tape of & kdat; it is usually formatted a formatting of the tape ahead, DAT drives not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the band will be lost! after completion of the formatting process the band will be automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the edit files. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or file in the local file tree. it is saved only this file or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a fuse profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in local file-tree with a hunter. only the selected files and / or subfolder will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click the right button on the local file tree and select in the menus...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog can open up for backup. in this dialogue you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Once you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears to backup. the dialog shows the progress of the securing process, including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select one file or a folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it is checked only the selected file or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives of the band with a herring. it is checked only the selected files and / or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click the right button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the testing procedure has been started, the dialog box for review. in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the verification for verification, the dialog appears to verify. this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can use the reproduce, the files are to be restored, which can be restored to two types:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives, which include entry for tape drive. it is restored only the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a hematmeal. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click the right button to create a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the resumption process has been started, the dialog box appears for restoration. in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the file folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog will restore the dialog. this dialogue shows the progress of recovery, as well as data throughput and remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it appears as necessary to re-create the band indexfile using the band content. this process will delete all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">Through this, a safety profile is created with the currently selected files and standard settings. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder, in which the backup should be carried out. the list of notifications is automatically updated according to the chosen work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the files listed under the backup files, the files are listed on the same file system, such as the folder. file, which are on other file systems, you can enter separately under backup files. every entry will be viewed from tar regardless of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last inextual backup, a snapshot file will be used. only the files are backed that have since changed since.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last inextual backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling from tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file is used for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; gt; and lt; LT; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the menu item KDat... in the menu settings. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device node for the tape drive (usually / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-winding version of the tape recorder.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is bound to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, & kdat is trying to lock up the throw at the bandage. maybe this setting does not work with all bandaging plants.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when solving the integration of & kdat; automatically the band is exposed. do not use this option for floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, & kdat is to change the hardware size for the tape drive. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you have to support & kdat; in any case the block size for your band run.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover one disk block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is machine name: seconds, whereby the host of the complete name of the system is formatted on which the band was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has been formatted since the period.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named in the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can manage themselves directly with & GNU; - tar administrating. even other tar versions should work as long as it does not include incorporate fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup pattern. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& kssystemlog; is a & KDE; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, where you can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the various protocol files. additionally, & ksystemlog; experienced users can access the quick access to information on problems related to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer does in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, which cannot know where you can receive information about your system or where the system deposited the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, we enables & ksystemlog; experienced users to provide quick access to information on problems related to their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, attempts to provide some extended functions that can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files for certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog has a number of useful functions. among others, this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, & kssystemlog functions; functions are available, with their help to filter out the single protocol-file easily and sort out. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual page.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & ksystemlog, first the most important protocol-file system - to open the system protocol, so you will not have a small message window, so you will not have Linux files usually in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually don't have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar, in order to filter out after a selected criterion or after the log-lines. in the default setting the box is displayed next to the filter line. then, a protocol line is displayed next to the filter line. then, a protocol-line will be displayed only if in one of the columns contain the string search string.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this place. the string of the filter search term will then apply only with entries in accordance with selected columns, and apply in the filter bar the name of a process, so it shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a striking colour than protocol lines of level hint. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can then use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to investigate the issue of a particular command, such as the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main menu to view all the next protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; enables the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage. once you select a subwindow, select a protocol display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / link _ log.forum-software.org. dort you will find more recent information on the reference sources of & ksystemlog.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; in addition, you will find in the following folder of the & KDE; -Subversion Archive: kssystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & KDE; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system develops rapidly to standard for control of the system boots up at the high-speed system in the Linux. world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and simultaneously more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (for example, because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to convert a machine on System V Init without a new installation and new format. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder from / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service which you want to start on a different runlevel. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services does not include such things as setserial, which will only be restarted. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be placed under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you don't have a lot of use. you can also want to run rc./ in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something that has to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column, and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix / etc / inlets by hand and change the 3. be careful, then you will repair it by adding the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it take all the correct scripts? if you enter in rc3.d, you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, every entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts out by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would pause the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the one contains a K, the script will stop with the argument. if it includes an S, the script will start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to establish machines for many purposes. I could go & eg; a server runlevel, which can run only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could even run a user Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was set as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say not say trivial: just pull one entry from the area of available systems services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also change scripts between Runlevy or change the position within one level by changing it elsewhere. in this case, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this is not done if they pull out an entry from the area of available systems services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved when you move it into a new range. in order to copy them only to a new Runlevel, you must select expressly copying from the menu Edit or select the context menu -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of this entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of existing entries before you can try again to include the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries which have been thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator key to enable the different working areas (Available System services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone entry into another Runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually, press the button button to switch between different fields. join the dialog by repressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are taken in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise it will be restored from & ksysv; alterations to the preferences are stored in a local cosyrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I've been experimented with the standard Runlevard, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Type on lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended to run Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way that system services are started in these distributions, simplified the configuration for the proprietary programs of these distributions, but unfortunately not standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use a different distribution file: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply stop without a message when their configuration files are not connected or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send us information about Runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaption by & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry store file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, user group and user group list. for editing, select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only when you have extended system settings, you will be able to make individual settings. other cards appear if shadow passwords, or such as / etc / master.passwd installed in BSD unitions.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password ticket password appears, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd installed as BSD -Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears, if for at least one embedded file system space limitation (Quota) is enabled and initialized (identifiable to the file system ratios user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user, but the limited number of limitations in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters may be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card details informs about the group-level of selected users. the standard group, which is owned by the user, can be found in the Primary Field. furthermore, the user can mark the user in other groups by clicking this in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialogue properties of the group includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, check this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select from the menu User or Group, or click on the appropriate adding button of the tool bar. editing or delete the selected users or the selected group works analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the lilo boot manager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time until the boats of the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
