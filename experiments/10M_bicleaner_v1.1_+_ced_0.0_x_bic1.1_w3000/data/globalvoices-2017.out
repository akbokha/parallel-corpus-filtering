although I had visited the USA for at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extremely big .
how many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I &apos;ve read American writers and operated his sports .
in fact , this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was born mainly due to an American film .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ff , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil @-@ Magn@@ um , who were the Supreme Court with judges who wanted his interest .
I was caught .
free after Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona had only strengthened the admi@@ ration for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived so inviting , whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always the way you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of con@@ sp@@ inning people .
I even had a very warm@@ ly love letter written about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me , as he goes with his bott@@ len@@ iness .
he never stops behind the mountain , as it is so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and Women .
nevertheless , people react to his asser@@ tions and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won at Republican Presi@@ dential elections , was the highest number one ever reached by the party .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ wig person , asked me ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his elec@@ tors in accordance with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alistic program , the people from all over the world , a deeply believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps did not agree with the title of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ umps intoler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr that fought for life long for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
still it fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who helped me with much patience and grace , and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those by them em@@ bodied my love in America .
as a b@@ ump of his way to the nominated Republican Presi@@ dential candidates , she gave me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t about non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump because they were either given to his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ smus or because they were willing to over@@ see these things , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
the people , one of my friends , said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think of another way .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
could it be that these elec@@ tors , of which most are white , voted for tr@@ ump , because they want to recover control over a country that has disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to rise a man who look down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . ) : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of White against all other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties &quot; ; pu@@ n from white in response to the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma , as it was the great Van Jones , did exactly what America did so great .
millions of people around the world will appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always like , America is always welcome .
for this country , as its president , elected twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ er , whose story he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , there &apos;s a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with vers@@ atility , religious freedom and the entire term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ru@@ der , they say .
with all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who is fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of choice .
on a rally for Hillary Clinton had a word of word with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ars .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called , and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN . &quot;
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was pleased , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Country , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could no more place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

from the mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin @-@ American children do not leave their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish !
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments &quot; by Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , in common with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
the music that is played on both places , not just the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music who lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among the tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for several years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one from children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments with an opportunity to overcome them .
a music school with 100 students is become the central concern for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , which is in one of the poorest provinces in Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ ker violence .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hop@@ el@@ essness .
young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI means :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they come together and with shining eyes and play in the Tru@@ ly you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ bre@@ l , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village , which is practically up on the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital - on instruments , which are manufactured from re@@ processed waste material :
music with re@@ produced instruments which consist of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycled under direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ i@@ ing viol@@ ins , viol@@ ets , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made from the waste .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin music as well as music of Beatles , Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article on Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez is a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o , which he had never seen before : a viol@@ ated violin was made of waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from re@@ adily available material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ lady Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance on : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who are living with him and of him are the poorest - as the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ lady Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspi@@ rational play from garbage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published a magazine for targeted information on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared use of contents .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liberia &apos;s waters before joining the other African coast .
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly brought up and much incl@@ ined to welcome a bill of bur@@ gl@@ ar to its co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the comp@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed themselves against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply refused anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive officer of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch the fish there .
ultimately , it was comp@@ elled to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia due to pill@@ aging fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , gover@@ ning criminal practices and protect resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
alongside Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are six countries who were the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries who work together and work together . they exchange information and are each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , because it is extremely difficult to trace . this is illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions .
due to deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm a delicate balance .
however , while actions against illegal fishing was once more disabled by bureaucra@@ tic hur@@ d@@ les , the actions occurred nowadays in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , individual countries can exchange or refine their lists , news about susp@@ icious activity or details that had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive when moving them at the open sea , using satellite data .
this enables the authorities to identify ships that fish in banned areas . even so susp@@ icious driving trails can be discovered , such as those who suggest that a ship invites his cap@@ tive fish on other ships .
in the Ide@@ al@@ case , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fish license , where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing , may be based on the basis of such information on the assumption of such ships in their har@@ bours . what does the ships do not sell their load . and that they even could be forced to count of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s then about significant financial losses for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is finan@@ cially worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Director Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a lawyer , which is supporting illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales , which lost eight members of the H@@ ISH network every year because of illegal fishermen , penet@@ rate into eastern African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , where the region is moving around the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying ph@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use the lack of international cooperation and make sure the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ tre@@ ach@@ able control system gain &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously a ship was illegal fishing and a country could say &apos; You must@@ n &apos;t miss my harbor &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this legal gor@@ hole attempts to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
there are criminal law uncovered , which had been distributed to fake licenses in Tanzania . there were ships who used several dec@@ eit@@ ful identi@@ ties and found it has been tra@@ vers@@ ed and found .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for the fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can divide information on illegal fishing across large distances .
some of our investigations lead us fairly far into the networks organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to produce susp@@ icious ships precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps prevent the illegal ships to spread themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ man use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Chief analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO , which also offers technical support and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be made by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system which links different information collected . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team African Nations can influence influence on the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana the platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown worldwide via the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the neighbours , to get a better picture of it , who does what is doing - this is simply meaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursu@@ it of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ als but also d@@ eter them .
ships which had to be exploited without licenses and hardly agreed with consequences , now they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH has now recorded a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped out Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board of tow@@ ing , whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are an academic project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear from illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six countries joined together in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . moreover , they now also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with safety , the aim is to allow more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph in October : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under the wrong flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used tow@@ ed , which are now prohibited .
the ship was also reserved in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative labour mode is actually working throughout the oceans .

after the government rejected Venezuela &apos;s application for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes were negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country by moving on the streets .
the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the order of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
the debate will be led in other parts of the country - including in the flat@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continually , which makes it noticeable in everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by an acute deficiency of food and medication .
many representatives of the Opposition saw in the revival of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; however , however , the accounting for a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne Díaz , co @-@ acting for Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in its latest articles in the context of government statements as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate of inflation and medicine is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a grave and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , to give the country the opportunity to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government .

especially large waves struck the message of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , prot@@ esters returned to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear Rö@@ cke , because you could see something that many nation@@ alists do not have !
meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic is already taking the round , which forms the amount of supp@@ ression each day :
thus the dictatorship was supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had the validity of the demand for a complaint procedure in question - this was now proven in the eyes many thanks to the presence of numerous people on the streets .

these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which made a little bit against the devastating economic crisis , and rather busy making critical voices in it :
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are getting more than frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ tians reported the media , they are too hungry to participate in a strike rather than to work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on August 23 , 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ in@@ ean news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to visit the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine City of Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba , against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated that were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not wanted his life .
beginning with the burden , the same name as his father bear to bear to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years , he retained the sec@@ rec@@ y for itself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that was in order .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , it is not noticeable that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I couldn &apos;t know that my father was a thief , a well @-@ known and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of State terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence department , 141 in the La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the ag@@ ro@@ cker which is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os Son , a man who knew the extent of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent , and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy , who made mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been rounded up with one of the ERP .
pass just that they will not lead you one day , and I must save you then .
the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , a Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ in@@ ists of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he accepted me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father had exhausted me .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda chief , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tortured &quot;
my father picked me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he made me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to advance . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - simply stood there .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a little bit wrapped in a ceiling and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw it was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were shut down and refra@@ ined me with an out@@ post .
suddenly he interpreted an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I went in , and saw a song , being tortured on man .
it looked like a dirt and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened at the body of the person who had just been tied .
they captiv@@ ated a people with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , crossed it with water , and drove him a charge of 220 volts to gen@@ itals .

the gest@@ ank there was terrible ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were sha@@ ken with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried on eye .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lopez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , an civilians who also was indicted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people lay down with the face , they were all covered in hands and his feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people kept silence on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What are you looking so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you answer me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this , because my father told home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was also accused of death for students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emilio Fes@@ sia , Head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the road that you came here , is also the way where the escape came here .
when you look at the map , see that they took about this track and then tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of substanti@@ ating a number .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above came that they should be moved .
this was a lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War &apos; of war &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war &quot; - as they named it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war@@ riors are a ba@@ j@@ on@@ ett or maybe military reb@@ ate that is fought against an enemy which one fought against .

but if you walk in a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , this is not a war of war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is The@@ ft .
I always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I answered : and you , whom you cut cars on the street ?
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded anger , struck me , and cried , saying ,
if you go so far , I will find you and roll yourself .
we don &apos;t need any others !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I found a photo of the back then I had a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing to home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been a pity on this crime . I replied , no problem , they can give me a burden , what they wanted .
I was there anyway , to say .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ h@@ ein@@ ous act .
now , where I am older , I feel repent@@ ance .
I have children . if only once children have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one develops and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have ex@@ propri@@ ated throughout the dictatorship of humans . but what the bodies disappear ?
why children ab@@ duct ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been simply put into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why can their bodies be dis@@ appearing ?
did these people not have families , to whom to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ h@@ ein@@ ous act , which one can do to man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
they were broken and disp@@ osed somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; my father said .
but anything remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
just clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , to show my father , was created during an interview when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities which I had to do because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt inn@@ umer@@ ated and asked me , why the whole Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were really good .
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you have killed people !
you have committed horri@@ ble crime , and you have comp@@ elled me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly that I did .
in 2010 , I received the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can imagine that I &apos;m pre @-@ cleaning . I eventually had told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 at the end of the process .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including heavier , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death row in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 years of child .

the sentences in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the regulation of judgement .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial completed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims , eventually in August , 1975 and December 1978 .
43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life sentences in 28 cases and in nine cases of prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , acqu@@ itt@@ als were acquitted .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the process .
# La@@ Per@@ secution : murder , torture and rape . # Es@@ War@@ ning terrorism
all the def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police @-@ affiliated and civil employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidnapped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the court is a historical milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ in@@ ean organization , founded in 1995 , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years but research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government handed over the country to La Per@@ la , so that there was a memorial place there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; horri@@ ble mot@@ orists &quot;
the sign@@ post with the translation error in a centre in K@@ YO@@ TO , in which one can extend his driving licence .
the photograph was distributed in social media .
processing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers have been re@@ opened to a newly opened centre where you can extend his driving licence during the last month witnesses of a very particularly mis@@ fortun@@ ate translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ko@@ rei@@ sh@@ sh@@ a ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means , for@@ g@@ ly - perhaps translated with b@@ unk@@ y back@@ rest &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awesome mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 @-@ 20 September to electronic ads in the entrance area and to read in the building itself .
the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was shared in the social media .
the mistake was the translator of Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also that the local newspapers had to look carefully .
the Kyoto protocol in Kyoto wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto just unacceptable , &quot; Holmes said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ ble mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate name if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was replaced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in Kyoto , however , ob@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore she explained that the error was already contained in the text , which they received from trans@@ lators and that translation was not checked on their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows the excuse :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we felt very sorry for older people felt by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News made a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of old mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are still involved in accidents , but certainly occasion to concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents in the year 2005 , equivalent to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens killed 1.@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this puts its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of elderly caused accidents in the same period increased in the same period .
the rep@@ utable not mentioned repor@@ ters published in the version of Article comments of the light that show the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older mot@@ orists :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awesome mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Flick@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
for transi@@ tions you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in the case of breast cancer . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators in the target language - do not be in the starting language - do not be in the language language .
this is what a French native language should translate from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language , which could make translations into English . this may be a lack of understanding for over@@ putting , cost savings or the relatively low number of English mother@@ boards that will learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign staff , consider translations of their own company . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is regarded as the best hon@@ orable , made for trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the verb@@ s and en@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases that are created by mach@@ elle translations , show that this technology can not replace human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to some languages especially .
some of the stran@@ gest English wor@@ d@@ ations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints that are often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to read or even understood .
photo by Flick@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable , or at least harmless . but by large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the Kyoto &apos;s city hopefully uses a resp@@ ect@@ ability source for their translations .
Venezuela : protest to take protests in the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan internet user out that they had no access to the online station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet performances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are also un@@ accessible .
other online transm@@ it@@ ters carried out the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups , re@@ posed by Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court himself .
Luis Carlos Díaz , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was en@@ capsul@@ ated , and recommended the users to get VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet@@ pages Venezu@@ elan Provider is again closed .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in periods of distur@@ ban@@ ces .
traditional media has been tent@@ atively scheduled for 2014 over protests since 2014 . then , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closure when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; appeal to violence . &quot;
I registered with no cable TV and informative national television channels me back at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
aston@@ ish@@ ingly that this is still more favorable than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ it@@ ters . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly passes their meetings .
former research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local Internet provider should sometimes use DNA . this is a technique , which determine the DNS server en@@ quiries regarding certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds right or denied the request when calling to a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ ol@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
on V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who was broadcast live in Caracas live in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was found in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : so that the Venezu@@ el@@ ans will continue to make access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls get to slave to receive an apprentic@@ eship
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testimony of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , which were just like they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report of Kur@@ ier , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the friendly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , &quot; falling schools &quot; ) which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where they did not live together with the family who lived there .
just before her studies at the University she returned to the house and heard how the owner &apos;s owner was full of pride on her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas are called in Paraguay that are more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a great family with little money over@@ gives her min@@ ty @-@ year old son or her younger daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned , is that the children need to pay for many days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within a contract which you can &apos;t raise .
these as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go described practice is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after finishing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organisation for the rights of boys and girls .
she talked with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected Zeu@@ s , re@@ cher@@ ed and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ adi@@ tas , guaranteed in general .
&quot; the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is the family that her daughter in the belief that they conclude their training in society , improve their position in society and can do something from themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who def@@ ends the girl with faith , justi@@ fies that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no training , and perhaps even star@@ ving .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they never know thereof .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to the hospital , her body showed traces of violent wounds . shortly thereafter , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military @-@ affiliated Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the population .
Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
on the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira defeated Mar@@ ín as long as a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered a fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
she stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society in the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest in protest and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without any official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which terms boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a large examination of the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be judge - if the first time in the history of English is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go ahead of court .
daily life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as a labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , she had to register and her father lost his job .
your brothers now had to go all work and started to sell money on the street or on the market of sweets .
they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still stayed some time for learning .
she rose early every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days she cleaned the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and the infected floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning , the more leisure time it had .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says it was never star@@ ving , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to collect more books from the home of the master &apos;s library as a meal from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls itself .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the land@@ lord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al Party , which was part of the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some detention forced the land@@ lord of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , standing next to him and Editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ators of the dictator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept them intelligent , but didn &apos;t stop her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land@@ lord had found someone who listened to , while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I was again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , at home again their mother tongue would speak Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the formation which they had made to lose , she explains .
however , it was completely clear that she got for everything they had paid by them with their hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which almost never talked about are mo@@ b@@ bing and the sh@@ ic@@ ans , Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I could not charge anyone home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time , where friend@@ ships develop , I felt very clearly that I was not one of the group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company appro@@ ves the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share a vac@@ an@@ cies for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s maids in Paraguay .
the ad@@ ministr@@ ators of the group is P@@ EPA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city portrait in the district of As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please contact you .
starting from Monday , when possible .
the display received five &quot; rec@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have had a 20 year old girl and gave their telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very beautiful , &quot; she wrote .
the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the country of the country that I want to work . &quot;
then the author of the display shi@@ fted once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with her .
thank you very much , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ Hair@@ y cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of witness testimony , former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Spanish conquest ) , which received the Spanish conquest of the Spanish conquest of the Spanish conquest of the Spanish conquest of the Spanish conquest and the native population of the M@@ ens@@ ú that many girls and boys were willing to pay themselves in a system of slavery , where they will have slight cas@@ u@@ alties for abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to the understanding of the phenomena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian Parliament approved a bill of draft law on regulations concerning the use and pay@@ roll of social networks . &quot;
if he is accepted by the Parliament , user experience and social media must be registered in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , a job would then be established , which in order to give citizens a permit to share social media .
within six months with acceptance of the Law , user within the site would have to register with their correct names and personnel numbers to be able to use social networks .

the bill , consisting of six par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application which is on the Internet and used to communicate with others through the voice , video language and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is passed if there is no indication of how Egyptian authorities can raise the user &apos;s registration . un@@ clear is also how they should make those who account that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .

that could mean that Egypt is planning to direct a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it &apos;s not known so far , that such plans exist .

Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior sciences &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly agree with the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they are non@@ violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , then it means that it will establish a powerful monitoring system to filters out citizens that apply a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to carry out a trial process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .

high above in the mountains of the region , in the northeast of Iraq , the veter@@ an owner H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation in Nature have to protect the g@@ ov@@ arian leop@@ ard .
a sub@@ type of the larger leop@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and they are always less prey .
why is this certain type of leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in the free game is low and goes against zero . as the team is therefore fixed at the video for a recording of a large cat in camera shots , R@@ aza broke out in pure joy .
as a trained biolog@@ ist , R@@ aza inspi@@ res another side of their country , which is not only in war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and an educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 , and assumes that protective zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region will be set up .

in early March 2017 , the conservative daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the Nor@@ theast Japan , had been achieved to rebuild the life of those who were affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a certain pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast that both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring suburbs of Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate were en@@ forced , because the tsun@@ ami had to van@@ ish all the coastal towns of the map .
in addition , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture had a nuclear accident , so alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o show from local point of view which advances six years later to rebuild the life of the local government .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of Japanese re@@ constructions as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
residential construction in Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( up to the end of the land , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was posted , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fukushima is the final light in Fukushima with 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of containers of containers , ev@@ ac@@ uation of containers of containers ( supp@@ ressed , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the final spare country .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in containers of containers .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers .
almost 40 per cent of the Fukushima ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fukushima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful here . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , who were home to the disaster in containers have been moved in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the status of work and daily life in the three @-@ affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine that 10@@ 74 from 1100 schools have been affected by mis@@ fortune , their gates is open until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fish@@ eries in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation in Fukushima , only 30 percent of fish@@ eries ad@@ mits have been re@@ recorded in Fukushima .
the tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident , has moved in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land large @-@ superf@@ ood .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fukushima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of land @-@ destroyed ar@@ able land of Fukushima , are in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ywood &quot; zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the tourism has thoroughly re@@ covering , but also here , Fukushima remains un@@ defeated .
the tourist deposits in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent at the same stand as before the disaster . Fukushima , on the other hand , only 75 percent can be seen here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared to the next major earthquake ?
to determine the overall picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation by . they asked them about the state of reconstruction and , as its emp@@ athy changed towards the tsun@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness under the native population .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents think that still not enough in disasters associated with disasters .
as it is about those who had ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fukushima pre@@ fecture
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper gave their attention to the position of ev@@ acu@@ ating Fukushima .
Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture was also a witness of the worst , disaster relief , nuclear accident , the Japan ever had to experience .
out of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fukushima , almost 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people , back after Fukushima , in a permanent spar@@ row homes .
after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants outside of Fukushima in their home pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astrop@@ hic areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ating areas are more than 50 years old . they have to come back in right containers because efforts have to compete for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukushima with massive construction projects . here , these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences first seem to be bigger than the common@@ alities .
however , after a while , one often tells us that more than it seems to be at first glance .
these global connections are important since they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remember that the world finally is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics related to reporting often less attention than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the common@@ alities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i explains how the love for music has been thinking about the lack of common language skills during a trip in the rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activist in the artificial coma , after he joined the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . published with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva in a wide spread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officers in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia had struck him in an attack against austerity . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the German university of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors carried him on Saturday this Saturday and now have put it into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local artist journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly in Brazil for a few days .
on the pictures there is also the face of the police officers to identify with an impact stock . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
following the incident the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the final examination of the incident was suspended from the active service .
the pictures show the police officers when he performs in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with its impact on the face of students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer let a police examine and landing at the intensive care unit , his face would be six months long on TV and the whole supp@@ ression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several param@@ edic shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is also filmed in social networks .
the clip shown below is the attack on Mat@@ eus down the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet@@ users now donated 10.000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to make a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing was divided into social networks several times .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here the activist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was assass@@ inated by his father , only to crimin@@ alise the Occup@@ y Movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary . and now we have been studying the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked on the intensive care station , after having attacked by police officers who struck him with a bu@@ ck .
police transfer
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s last Friday .
police officers were among the protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber @-@ fin and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media protests have failed to focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo ad@@ ressed specifically about a broken glass window to illustr@@ ate their cover pages .
however , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus in a fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken shut@@ down than the protests of thousands of people that serve the defense of a special issue .
this is necessary to recognize , if one is strictly disappointed against any form of damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd , un@@ respon@@ sive meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are dealt with headlines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on the confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
the villages of discovery of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the national congregation of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as a central Central - on Spanish Zu@@ ck@@ enstein , regardless of which there is no notable sugar harvested on site .
it is two years ago , when the activities were l@@ ayed in the sugar cane factories .
after the replacement , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
other re@@ signed and com@@ mute daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a solo v@@ et@@ eter@@ an who rises at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar tube industry does not smoke his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , after long in@@ active time , because they were received .
that was something that he was not expecting .
N@@ ene reminds me exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane resistance has already resistance the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administration decisions , and climate change .
in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more modern .
why was the Cuban sugar cane kicked off ?
the old platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction of sugar cane was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane and the sugar crisis in the world market .
however , the sugar price increased again about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ sper@@ spek@@ tiven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go down with safety in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the first words of Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the Su@@ gar Factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the stagn@@ ation of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , talking about the closure of the factory , the word that he repe@@ ats most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respondents are of the same mind : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first leap year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially registered documents , which would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed , the mailing sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could make any escape .
from then on , the responsibility was paid and the letters were getting more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the nursing factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still used sugar pipes , &quot; he as@@ sures us .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was opposed to his will at the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped , involved .
with each part , which he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial sector developed by Cuba and most important workplace producers was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases there were no alternatives for the work areas and services that were gener@@ alized in the municipalities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would be well underway .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
sugar@@ cane has been extracted only high since 2004 .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the community of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better , when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather than they began to beef it , they also heard that road to asph@@ alted , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without a work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they became spare parts .
without future perspectives , many young people left the region at once .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are impressive .
in the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ und@@ one &apos;s old soldiers bring a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a tri@@ cky person but for@@ gives the lies that he told him not .
they have tor@@ ment it for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into retirement age 65 years ago , not because it is lack of power but because it is bit@@ tered .

first Nations young@@ sters use Hip @-@ Hop to express yourself and maintain their own culture
recording of a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an .
you@@ ths of the First Nations communities in Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour we bring mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to accommodate youth groups , song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in Montreal with ten cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e hip hop group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop proves that the young participation in our conversations subjects such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever is to come in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where the young people are the main actor .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the Kit@@ bu@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not resolved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to conv@@ ey how important to the preser@@ vation of traditional customs and customs , despite the impact of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people not always domin@@ ate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people involved a little help by Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop Group that gave them a St@@ ron@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an , St@@ roph@@ he is available in notation , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes , I feel like nobody ever would like to be interested in
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;m trying to go further on earth my days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the day you &apos;ll take away our cry
because we have lost our way in life as youth
but I believe that we will rise one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
so they can grow and continue our youth as well
thus , they can do what they determined by the Creator

in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( free of charge ) outside of typical restaurants in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every Restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what is happening exactly on the menu , close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( in the amount of food , &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are displayed by each dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers look at these plastic dishes , and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi is a variety of these small companies that create those plastic dishes that documented the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turning now in con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous cell phones and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in the special sale : new with plastic dishes decorated with plastic stra@@ ps , as they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial food were turned into kit@@ ten collecting objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some sho@@ cking fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food positions will increasingly elabor@@ ate .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone support .
we also produced this part in the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple , who is holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing return to the com@@ ical .
some mobile phone support and mobile designer allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura and Lach@@ s@@ wine is used , a popular t@@ opping , served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with laughing ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant to surprise .
our latest mobile support has the shape of mel@@ ier ice .

&quot; for the victims of fighting against drug dealers . &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly occurs in statistics . however , this mirror does not affect the extent of human tragedy that brings together this battle .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , th@@ ron@@ ged the stories of the conflict in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , barely any one looks to those who have learned to live with pain .
behind every body , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds might never heal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learning with drug dealers live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) into life that will give these victims a voice and told stories of people who directed the struggle between the prosecution and the cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project :
organized crime lets us not just fear our lives .
the imp@@ lications are much deeper .
for example , if stores close because they are threatened by drug dealers and many municipalities have to drive a lot of kilometers to buy something so simple as milk .
pain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how frigh@@ tened life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father that is searching for every weekend of secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings and her husband and her neph@@ ew .
Pri@@ est : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task that we have asked us to get rid of and to graves , after the people we loved are looking for . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electronic business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
on October 15th he was going to be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentic@@ eship .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they demand a death customer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; will explain why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t just have to show the faces that are afraid of fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state control .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts of stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have already known illness and sens@@ ory journ@@ alism now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the titles pages with pictures , which actually only originate from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or act of specialists .
it brings me out of version .
sometimes , I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes further :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cousin thinks that he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people will hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders if they go through the streets .
for me , this is what would those who have lost someone who have lost someone and those who fear that something like that .
I see our weakness when stories are going to blo@@ t numbers in a statistic .
the in@@ el@@ essness of the people is unbelievable for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour place to be justified they were &quot; attentive . &quot;
I think they &apos;re trying to interv@@ ene that they will be spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of ex@@ tor@@ tion in the main town : like a family with threats of threats . &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als were killed for month money from their business , until they had not only destroyed the business , but also had torn her family apart .
you think of everything you lost , and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are apart from each other , the better .
she finished her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they kill or kill you .
I asked myself in these aw@@ ful days , if weeping would dissolve my profound feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to weep . I have to learn to live with pain .
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the honored Generation . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , their parents &apos; care for them .
Bryan is a watch@@ man and he tells that he had to teach , how to make a egg cooked , potatoes , sprinkle with tortillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi , &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells the nine nar@@ ro@@ bs on his left side - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he only saw a few blocks away from his home , the bloody dead body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 , as violence was organised by the organized crime and fight against the already existing social issues in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the civil rights and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone the public prosecutor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 murders . this corresponds to the average of 8,5 murders per day .
these are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the country &apos;s soul .
just a few stories still live in view of new headlines . but this project reminds us of those who are not to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data set up in 2015 , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades , in comprehen@@ sible manner .
when a picture is worth thousands of un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flick@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this entry and the pages in which he links , include pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or to un@@ mask .
but what is the years after the first time being immer@@ sed ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to pass on .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been utilized mis@@ appropri@@ ately to cultiv@@ ate trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong copy of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire to images .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second biggest country had been neglec@@ ted and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous tra@@ des full of impact holes , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the gas vehicle fell victim to the victims .
bureaucra@@ cy representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of dozens , including a cinemas , which was full of people watching the football world championship .
houses desper@@ ate and carbon@@ ated cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the di@@ vin@@ ity .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of hol@@ low bodies which are co@@ iled on the ground while they look at them .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years , the same photo has been en@@ capsul@@ ated several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but may not be attributed to real but not in the context of the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ le@@ genous Nig@@ erian villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities , to whom they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; said a population to Human Rights Watch .
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only from satellite imag@@ ery could be illustrated by the follow @-@ up time .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win B@@ oko Har@@ am ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as proof of the fact and the possible extent of attack was shown :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ norm@@ ative use of the DR Congo is only one in a series of errors ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was presented as a proof for measures .
another step further bring personal comments , such as this example , from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge joined the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash@@ message , published by the United Nations , those who were fle@@ eing attacks , rape and some dead , some of them are burned .
while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared as the following , which brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ dic Arabian News page , which was fal@@ sely maintained by President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an Being , monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to gras@@ p this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news agencies , the AFP , as their source , were also fal@@ sely explained by being this statement , but had not been associated with the picture from the DR Congo .
the world wide range of false statements
traces of these false cou@@ plings submit to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere across the world .
using a &quot; reverse @-@ looking picture , &quot; you can see how far information limits can be crossing .
a reverse @-@ looking picture search with the search@@ engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures at 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixing sheet of private parties , platforms social media and communities as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , and some have tried others to un@@ mask the for@@ g@@ ings .
we have examples of the abuse of mis@@ use and associated with the respective countries , based on what they were published on which page they were published . thus , we want to represent the range of clear@@ er than the language alone .
from the below listed countries ( which have also been connected together ) several examples of ab@@ norm@@ ative use can be used .
here are some cases which can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
country @-@ examples of false cou@@ plings of the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries indicate pages or servers , which are still available in the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or counterfeit detection .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via the Tin@@ Eye , probably also a fake example .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma -@@ Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum - addressed to Algeria &apos;s and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brazil , 2011 . &quot; C@@ ena Cho@@ can@@ te !

true or false ? ) .
one side , the rum@@ ors of rum@@ ors , asked that the said photo Christians were killed , which were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only indicate the mis@@ message but also rel@@ ates the mis@@ use of the picture from the DR Congo related to Nigeria and further questions concerning the Inten@@ tions of Persons and the Pro@@ mis@@ ed trage@@ dies ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los puerto ti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( whereby it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ ets according to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; clearly no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster have seen this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster renamed the f@@ law@@ ed use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then by a post of US @-@ American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continue in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate . &quot;
this article makes atten@@ tively attentive to the continued trouble of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quoted the work of an article of Indian Express with the picture from the DR Congo ; the article of Indian Express had not included this image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Greece , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hold down quickly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this page used the image as a proof that Muslims kill Nig@@ erian Christians killed .
this asser@@ tion was ref@@ uted by a Greek fact check @-@ page in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries released an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims via the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and illustr@@ ate the picture of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a residents of the Old town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o by Tren@@ to posted this message to its page to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even inside Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was assigned to the B@@ oko Har@@ am bombing in Kan@@ o in public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of a mis@@ use of the picture from the DR Congo , using a Twe@@ et , the sympathy against the Nig@@ erian massacre , and on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are tra@@ ced to del@@ igi@@ ate , since the photos were mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ably used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar released a correc@@ ting to what they came as &quot; inten@@ tionally f@@ aked news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions in Myanmar . &quot;
this justi@@ fication that has been published exclusively in English contains also references to fake pictures of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ks who operate the H@@ ate Speech and extrem@@ ist groups that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and the other ( which is often widespread by bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ atigue m@@ ah@@ or@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ в@@ о@@ б@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ а@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ а &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christian@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post which refers to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the DR @-@ Democratic Republic does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an being involved in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Kath@@ ol@@ le@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly explained that the picture is not taken from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later turned into circulation with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to prevent it links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , accompanied by this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dis@@ integrated a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that took refuge in the name of the Islam@@ s , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was t@@ wit@@ ched as proof for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages related to this were not taken in any religious context .
instead , the target was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre , it was translated into circulation , translated as this here in Vietnamese and declared it to the wrong message .
from the embassy where the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are further confirmed examples of a defective use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , ag@@ gregation and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Gray ) , Tin@@ Eye has also not been fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data contracts with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ est@@ amps exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they have image names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original disaster of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( mon@@ t@@ ins ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the murdered victims of Christians or the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming does the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate how pictures are used in the context of these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can &apos;t give these images to no longer faith .
with social media , there &apos;s a lot of people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally inf@@ lic@@ ted the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ mis@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and lubric@@ ate the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of non@@ violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that this is rec@@ eding from images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves .
at the same time , concern that non@@ violent pictures of readers and viewers dis@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze and see them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the examined , how violent media contribute to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss the news media about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you &apos;ll have to mind thoroughly aware of the situation in which an image suggests , however , from context or completely mis@@ use type .
any investigation may be considered internationally , but should be considered internationally as international .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ mistak@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer language enth@@ used a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate .
such words are available in any language : they press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specifically .
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , which are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish s@@ wimming@@ esa ) .
but all resist stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation , and sometimes somewhat context are necessary to understand what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and Lingu@@ ist by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s VAT , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h to remember your parents in recognition of what we have tried for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after the sun has grown in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they dis@@ gr@@ ind other cultures , reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish more of this &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade
the island State Sri Lanka is now facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally takes place at the end of May , floods the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ sson and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a statement of the disaster of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of floods and mud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 secure residence .
the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the rivers in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene conditions constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos conv@@ ey an impression of the extent of the disaster catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water ranges from up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood @-@ situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly curse wor@@ sen the den@@ gu@@ ins crisis , Save the Children , after further rain cases are already on the way .

use the t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trusted her to her four years old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we &apos;re still calling Par@@ ols for women &apos;s rights .
in the next scale we use rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other denom@@ inations against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separ@@ ating me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; built up in their imagination .
they de@@ mus@@ li@@ fy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit there , be mus@@ li@@ zed .
de@@ mus@@ li@@ zed
I don &apos;t get that alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what kind of images come from one in the sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was a Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western idea the religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from among the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims , which has been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing educational language is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward Said broke the story behind this picture .
but these pictures continue to stand still today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues to ste@@ er them .
I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ ra@@ tives domin@@ ate our news feeds .
this Nar@@ ra@@ tively overs@@ had@@ ows the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries in the past three decades , while the USA won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are inhi@@ bited to bear head@@ scarf in public buildings and su@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , that both are two sides of the same medal .
a mighty group has committed his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ rative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it sees it across the fact that the first Muslim Pra@@ yers were spoken to American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers who had been sign@@ alled with slave ships .
it cle@@ ars the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this Nar@@ ra@@ tively has occupied our collective pre@@ ference force in the deep and in@@ correct that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the goal of anti @-@ milit@@ arily attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , who help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to recognize the nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise the highest &quot; religious group in America &quot; in the highest degree .
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ha@@ em@@ ic Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants from the first generation that come from 77 countries .

I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born only in my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they interv@@ ene in the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ours are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour who see my rock in the surf that I am the Muslim , if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I put them in my arms , and you the Arab verses to protect the Koran , which are called the Quran and called the Q@@ uls .
every of them I repeat three times .
I pray therefore , that they are protected from evil , evil one can see and evil which cannot be seen .
my Muslim faith is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

Muslim means to be the prayers , which they had spoken to me , if I have a bad day .
for his to be , as she taught me to refer to God : Allah is what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that has been colon@@ alised by a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has established a company with the name of ener@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a depth of meaning God to call my only Lord .

belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at stake .
Muslim means to be aware that in the past two centuries , Europeans all have been colon@@ ized to four Muslim countries .
it means that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the history was thrown off a century ago over a Muslim land .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , aff@@ old sub@@ subject of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspaper of his time as he was the first mosque in England .
even before the planes left , he travelled into more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that when a tragedy is native to the United States and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name bears the story four times more often than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means that four@@ teenth years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought into this country .
it means Malcolm X to name a American hero .

to be a mother means to worry about my child and all Muslim children , knowing that power@@ full and privileged people build on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim Registry creatures which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in immigration li@@ tig@@ ation , which takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that broad@@ ened its borders to people from just the lands that it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and nebul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely accepts Arab and Muslims .
it is the wars we lead and the bombs we throw on Muslim lands .
due to the stories , which we tell and due to those that we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University of participants showed a scientifically uncertain image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deeply dar@@ ing to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; other &quot; .
we have been back decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faulty and dangerous forms of expression we bri@@ be in our news @-@ editors .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which attempts to capture our multiple with con@@ jun@@ c@@ ate identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ ens ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim , a initiative , increased Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American super@@ hero , all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initi@@ als want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .

but I am concerned about this difficult global time in which we are located .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason for this con@@ spir@@ ators , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now introducing the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has been exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown by having created the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years before , it had not been given it yet ; now they possess great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the story that I was not aware of when I was so old now , as it was my daughter , but I have made my daughter today to an un@@ disputed Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread track in my speech .
things , perhaps remin@@ ding of memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions which makes our human beings , likes to listen to a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation will take place at the 8th Annual Meeting to Islam@@ opho@@ bia .

initiative for stories aims to preserve urban diversity

can there be a possibility , here and now , despite a language barrier with somebody in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the stories of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported about another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language diversity of major cities and to appreciate it .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or in Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not given to the children born there .
for the makers of the project is :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided , when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hear , to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers choose their story first in their own language and transl@@ ating or explain it to English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion and their portra@@ yal are that the audi@@ ting re@@ ader@@ ship point out .
they call up laughter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language d@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story of history of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou will also take the opportunity to explain to their land typical customs of stories .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ able of H@@ oses and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he explains the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this that you speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide greeting he divi@@ des his feeling of exclu@@ siv@@ ity :
they have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can operate with T@@ LS in contact to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico demands from the USA to re @-@ establish sovereign debt
with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place at 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 . the march was launched at the pu@@ er@@ toria Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
she was proclaimed by the &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Citiz@@ ens for the neur@@ otic test of the debt ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ish Church Assembly Puerto Ric@@ os .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; princip@@ als of the re@@ taining of new debts have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their requirement :
the people of Puerto Rico claims that politicians , banks and government agencies , responsible for the debt are responsible for their corruption .
we call for a financial inspection and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a solid , our working conditions , corresponding to the benefit of the economy .
we will destroy and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt , which is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with singing pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the nation &apos;s territory integrated into the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization , with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , is an alternative to the existing authority .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of government infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will be carried out by the people without participation and conviction of the citizens .
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

but he is not forgotten .
over five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has performed for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture that will be alig@@ ned to Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign dedicated to this event .

the book , which was published last year and licensed here , contains a number of par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s that deal with free culture in the supp@@ ression of the repression .
it &apos;s a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction , it says :
this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the true cost is to which this is associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researcher and authors , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to view over the nebul@@ a which surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted by the Ad@@ ra prison List in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us let us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions , and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we abandoned this process of time @-@ wise over@@ beliefs ?
since March 2012 , the web developer of Open Source and Digital Activity has been in prison for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military setup to an unknown place .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; had taken hold of the military court from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government and used it by an alleged deaths against her husband .
his residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in which access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologi@@ an and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ els &apos;s cultural prototypes were predic@@ ting as the work that he started to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the trail of numerous civilians and merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS had everything that architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world .
this strike in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ al@@ u@@ able for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not yet close this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life to dream of freedom . he taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already in jail .
I have learned to read and talk to English .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked others . he has taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart phones .
he brought me the Internet .
he has also taught others as they use computer , at least theore@@ tically , without having held a real hands in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ filing which she wrote in the years 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in jail .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .

Mozambique : convicted of corruption and convicted director after dis@@ miss@@ al release
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ ans responded to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the work@@ station in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this focuses on Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for leaving over 54 million seas .
the money was originated from public funds of the Mos@@ ambi@@ k and its council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately requested his recovery in the company , which happened on April 19 then .
in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who wer@@ ved the application , there was no obst@@ acle to refer to Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to refer to his old item since the company did not perform disciplines after his imprisonment .
however , many people are not called the action .
the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to make the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clearly illustr@@ ate the absence of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , so C@@ IP .
what we have to know is that the company should have in@@ corporate a disciplinary procedure against the contradic@@ ting trade .
the company was silent , however , and caused no appropriate legal steps to use the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ ence social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour as &quot; resi@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them served .
he could keep lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has approved to be integrated into the company which he helped inf@@ lic@@ t damage .
therefore it &apos;s obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly be paid for his silence .

Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state , because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded with such a way that the state has already been insul@@ ted so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ality to serve and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served herself by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as handy it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man , who was invited and finally condemned to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .

one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he was more energetic , that &quot; an ambitious human being is to be able to sell his own personal interest , too . &quot;

an ambitious human being is criminal . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to wrong

according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network adopted its posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origins of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ jec@@ tively &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or the d@@ elling ( in Bur@@ m@@ acy ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements have given an extremely ab@@ rupt con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism in this case , but the word addressed to itself does not appear automatically .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that hosts , in which they discussed the use of the word , or have doubts about the use of his use , were cen@@ sored .
in addition there are several bur@@ mes@@ m@@ ical words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequences such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spher@@ es ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way , whether they might know how he could re@@ lie@@ ve his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the phrase u la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in @-@ win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will be a radical nation@@ alists , but also empha@@ sized that Facebook has to be analytical , before it extingu@@ ish all Po@@ sts who would like to spread rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filter the word automatically .
the Automati@@ cally will not understand what you write on Facebook users .
what it should do instead , is carefully resear@@ ching and control the post by checking the following words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spher@@ es ) .
the good is that these three @-@ minded nation@@ alists , that hate speech language , will receive a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to compl@@ ain nation@@ alism .
while the action is a powerful signal to all , which hate speech language , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long .
social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship of perc@@ ussions are often a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , with the user &apos;s social networks just start to use a new word or alternative editing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung Ka@@ at described how Facebook started to extingu@@ ish its posts when he only wanted to inform his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and told me the li@@ ken , post and sharing of contents for 24 hours , because the post &quot; the Facebook community standards did not answer . &quot;
Facebook has a wide variety of hosts of people who have no negative inten@@ tions or try to show their opinions against the speech @-@ talking radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the mail , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook was supposed to have more about the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask Rat :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform but it does not work .
such words become cen@@ sored will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
it also appears as if they have started this without any local context or technical support , and as words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance cur@@ ry &quot; have forbidden .
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they do not attempted to report the fal@@ si@@ bly deleted poet .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a great turnover , this would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ensor has provided for a lot of mo@@ ckery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are doing so funny about Facebook and consci@@ ously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts will be taken from the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that contained no hate speech but still removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and have an inheritance cur@@ ry and watch a Indian film .
just try to try , whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists , social networks have already used to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech is to heat violence in social networks in Myanmar in addition , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to carry out @-@ out speech on his bur@@ m@@ ese sites under control .
but instead of stimul@@ ating the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to st@@ ow on context than on code concentration initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is at the end with the child .
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child &apos;s house is illeg@@ ally illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously decided to ban this practice , so that the age of holi@@ er is now at 18 .
before this change of the her@@ etic and Muslim religious communities held on practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ persistent Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group that refused to mix representatives of various religious groups in the country , that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state that &apos;s not the maturity of maturity . &quot;
this imp@@ lies regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors of younger than 18 years of age .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent , and 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical agency confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tioning and social media movements which ende@@ av@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s time , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children before they should say , dam@@ ned by their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition ensured for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts that the opposition would not agree to the bill of law .
but early in 2017 , the bill was decided against the child &apos;s health - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including one woman ) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country has to agree , and to pro@@ claim the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators issued a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of the Children &apos;s House was voted by 35 votes in the House of Represent@@ atives , and none else decided against it .
after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws have been amended for child@@ r@@ als before finally .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , which held a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary tann@@ ins needed to have the essence of the matter , but do you know what ? the child &apos;s house is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now worth every price .
while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely going to take enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public release update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , &quot; Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law has been noted :
the sanc@@ ti@@ fying age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft to change the sp@@ ouse , on June 9 , 2017 , has been decided .
there are 41 members of the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all members who were opposed to the law voted for the law .
the child@@ r@@ als is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ fish .

but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the famous Hind@@ u organisation of the country .
prior to months , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to make judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to resolve his ple@@ dge now .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al @-@ wi , a dis@@ advoc@@ ate of the law , it was quite legal if Mahar@@ aj wanted to proceed against the law , the most social media users wish to approach the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed to :
dear Sat if we , instead of speaking the discussion so general , in a way that can cause panic and wor@@ m@@ ness to talk about that the State , our daughters that protects them from great , hard @-@ fed men who are against them in the advantage , would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ d@@ ations are legally or still the norm , although there are laws which they say .

through the mirrors of Web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again .
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , with the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright legislation in the United States .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia .
day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and the fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many techniques are used for blocked websites ( a recent article by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been locked out by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 was adopted after the Internet Act ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
in China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive C@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain locked , several mirrors are now mir@@ ro@@ red ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updates ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform compiled all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( so that machine computers connections ) was based on the system of domain name and therefore makes a complete c@@ ensor difficult .
the content is custom@@ iz@@ able in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put it all to take snap@@ shots of Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the site www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was performed independently from the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia involved in other efforts to avoid the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ .org , an open source project that everyone can use to hold similar Mir@@ ror pages when locked in the country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as employees at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s open Spe@@ ak &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
it is access@@ ing a different URL , which is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server guides the request on the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ alese game photographer uses his camera to look attentive to the need for nature conservation .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around himself , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ ly position@@ able moti@@ ves and full colors .
the motivated him to carry him a camera and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar devoted himself to the international scene .
and his home village right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that l@@ acks attention to Nep@@ alese wildlife .
he described Facebook as this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could be better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I was wonder@@ ing at home when he suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that would be a leop@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river , where the leop@@ ard was found and I immediately started to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to achieve cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ alese nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he should know it , because he stood at face to face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b by the opinion of the sheep not during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately puts us down , we see you and he star@@ red me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near tourist arri@@ vals .

years after the wedding , Indian women for the first time to pron@@ ounce the name of her husbands
women in the small Indian village of Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of an content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women should avoid the greatest care , the names of their husbands , or even from older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns saying &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should viol@@ ate the norm in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian state of O@@ ev@@ a by a p@@ seudo @-@ court and from her family and the village community , after she had addressed a registered relatives with names .
the tradition of their wives also does not exist in the name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer assign@@ ments to fear if ever , they should not follow these practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health professionals and house@@ wives , a unique club , thus became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone in which they discuss and discuss the beau@@ ties of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and sett@@ ling for the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices , such as child bri@@ be up to the support of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected , and runs these clubs .
it reports how these clubs were created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassador of change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini shown in her discussion round , acted by women who do not call their husbands at name .
she decided on this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
the names of their husbands , not no@@ isy , is an example that hon@@ ors them all obligations and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this will be regarded as post@@ pon@@ ed as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made thoughts about this discussion group .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to try her husband so far , to try at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells you :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video had ended .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion .
many women had heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before heard . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini displayed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women attempting to bring discussion with a exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then they asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us what they want , means that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ a from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which women married the name of their husbands .
Roh@@ ini tells you :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise only k@@ ins@@ ed , another decided to release all the fru@@ stration of fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
in addition to the ad@@ renal@@ ine round about , with an ancient bre@@ ach , the women decided to actually try her husbands at home to call their husbands at the name .
and they held their word .
in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a wide variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , asking what ideas she put in the head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family .
when her mother in law urged them , she was afraid , and said that there was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini meant to do it . &quot;
a husband of participating in was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as the tra@@ verse of the interest of interest in the forehead , which indicates the sp@@ est@@ atus :
why do women only need to show women that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I heard it to carry him .
the other women did not complete with that , but think that they are now in a better position to choose him in some days .
for many women , the discussion is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do a trip at each review .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says .
during the last months , she celebrated their own birth days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they had never made thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
for so many years I have been working on this problems and yet I have been working on some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our husbands , have never been so honest .
it feels great , certain things to say loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we have talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have borne sar@@ is only since their marriage .
for most , this is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ eh @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt for a tro@@ users , they don &apos;t have dar@@ ed .
after a lot of controversy and discussion on the benefits of your own wardrobe , mor@@ ality linked to the sar@@ is and much more , s@@ mu@@ g@@ able Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that women could carry them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a with which they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it .
on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly getting into rolling :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tasted a few times , but then again stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women bear in at every time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in discussion forums know that the changes that they want to achieve in their life - like the line to navigate up more freedom of movement or its own dress code - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives everyone the confidence that something is going to change .
and I know there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if each woman goes home in the club and other people about it , what we &apos;re talking about and what we do .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for the organ@@ ist , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , is more worried by the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . now , the local government called a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the bodies of sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi will be used .
there is the local aber@@ rations that the head of a noble man &apos;s gold can reveal gold or wealth , the police officer of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia to the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks were registered in Mozambique of Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to us that UN 2016 initiated a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .

the persecution and assassination of noble individuals for the winning and selling of their organs in the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has given cultural moti@@ ves and is suspected of the traditional sham@@ ans , which also calls for belief in Mozambique , according to which the victim existed in the head , the wealth of riches .
in the last days three men were murdered with hair fail@@ ures in this part of the country .

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , probably made only recently .
this story was originally published on Hong Kong Free Press , July 8 , 2017 .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in international community attention after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison because of &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State partner ) , after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o for the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and nar@@ rative a speaker , he has understood it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China will continue to receive calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , di@@ chter@@ in Liu X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely covered by the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized several reactions from abroad .
United Nations , United Nations
index R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese civil servants to discuss the case of Liu .
however , a speaker refused to comment on whether the United Nations should print pressures in order to enable Liu abroad for a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister , B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de , refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway became the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010 , although the Norwegian government reported that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to record the salmon forces to China , as the exports had been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release and invited Liu to get his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to pay his price .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to re@@ lie@@ ve Liu and his wife immediately by house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the European diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as it took part in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect to increase all the limitations of Mr Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits , they want them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility for treatment abroad , as long as it can help him &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy was asking the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu , but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia of their house arrest .
the US embassy was an angry response from China , following the utter@@ ance of the Foreign Ministry that &quot; no country have the right to interv@@ ene and un@@ answering such remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple following :
protection and freedom , such as travel insurance , and access to the medical supply of its choice , which they have been entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push out Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I ask China to leave the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he knew in a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3rd , Berlin , that Liu explains all the medical support which he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reuters that China had great concerns if the verteb@@ ra@@ e could overs@@ ha@@ dow Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um visited China to provide reasonable medical care and provide him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told me that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always watched the room in the hospital , and that Liu is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um goes on to say :
Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old the rights of this rights un@@ locked .
France
France &apos;s external ministry called for China in a statement on 29 June to release Liu from humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless where , needed . furthermore , his wife and family may have contact with him .
although the news of news reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the State Department announced that there would be no further information that France will ultimately receive him .
Taiwan
on June 27 , China called for the Council of land@@ land@@ an@@ gelegenheiten in Taiwan on June 27 , to release Liu , and to show a greater tolerance towards those that demand peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese leg@@ islat@@ ure Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic People &apos;s Democratic Party of China also called on to allow dise@@ ased intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , presented in a statement on 28 June by Liu , and gave evidence that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us .
he spoke about Liu :
it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished to a harmon@@ ious , more stable and weal@@ thi@@ est China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged , when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or land ?
Singapore .

Singapore is a city or a country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly since Singapore is at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam should be considered a city as a city .
this remark triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it assi@@ sts that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to rotate logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country , we hear that we are no country at end .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the ticket to escape from the responsibilities , a must inf@@ rin@@ gement .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the grounds were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , considering that he appeared un@@ avoid@@ able un@@ democratic .
however , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that become permanent from a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the main point of the subject , the good old Lei@@ er appears on the author@@ itarian mach@@ inations , who pret@@ ended to be demo@@ cr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic since they fit into their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam had given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions tar@@ ried with non @-@ answers rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls upon Sh@@ an@@ amal@@ gam to illustr@@ ate his opinion , because she didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , it is a city , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our wer@@ ful K Sh@@ an@@ dis would take up the effort to clari@@ fy this point if he was paid up in order to be part of the city of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog its commentary , he refers to the critic@@ isms that you should start to read the entire tran@@ scription of the conference , so that you can understand the context of the statement by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated , why the elections were so important in Singapore , even if we are free and righteous elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he died in Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in that sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam , who as a leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the Justice Minister said of Singapore has said very much ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - would I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes , right , and aware of what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review broke the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
does Mr. Sh@@ an@@ thro@@ amal@@ gam have committed a mistake or was it a while ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally countryside and city .
since he plays an important role within the government of the government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ dis are serious importance .
why do the people share their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
in order to extend the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to confirm Singapore , it was always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ ore@@ an ...
nobody has said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that &apos;s not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should talk about the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most Miss@@ y aspect about your residence or homeland ?
your answers will be published here as part of a ongoing series , which should be revealed in rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ ets should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply , then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live and live in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ itely to show interest in his talk partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my clari@@ fication , mostly the standard reply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in anger , if they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t bo@@ ther me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there are few that diff@@ ers us Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans will bring a Canadian flag well visible to her ruck@@ sack when they are travelling .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , however , ... .
so it was even when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le sheets on her luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay couples have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is also considered the most toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends who I admire very much .
there would be nothing to me if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; means to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be busy - as is good , gentle , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
harmless to be harmless and un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and no attention to earn .
this can be a good thing if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that pass around one around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go as far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a prime minister of Canadi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters only .
what exterior standing as &quot; nice , &quot; maybe just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we are lacking the warm , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a Pop band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a music video published in Thailand , which celebrated the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and despite its promises to restore civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his friend to make his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers indirectly to the sustained military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet @-@ makers for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was awarded 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists stri@@ pped to view the public .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy , in@@ particular how it is capable of dealing with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
have a look at these photos of the video , which relate to some of the political topics that have pursued the Thailand in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , which led the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army &apos;s absolute deci@@ ding to important national topics .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for the &quot; setup change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians , and other persons who are considered to be a critic of the jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , supervised the online content and charged people who accused the monarchy to have been de@@ fam@@ ed , pro@@ secuted .
Thailand sets a stri@@ pped sound against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ation ins@@ ult ) .
on 20 May 2014 , Thailand was proclaimed the war .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems continued to pursue the jun@@ ta is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although safety reasons they warned that the purchase is unnecessary , and a waste of tax ev@@ asion .
the video is even scre@@ ened , as people can be thrown into a black delivery van , before they bring them into an interference @-@ bearing , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and internet us@@ ur@@ ers are threatened long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .

it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al indicate distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal tanks of exhaust Asia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet areas .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and aby@@ ss@@ es live in the area .
these settlements are also called the ghost town in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
during the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people in the pre @-@ war period , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 people , after having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ k@@ ai@@ kas , symbo@@ lically represent the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I speak to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all served in the community .
now there are only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
people who once lived in this place once and had their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still accommodate one or two families , recogni@@ zes the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother is forbidden to let us take photography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers in her friend and suddenly abandoned the demolished building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of scenic products for the self @-@ demand ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to come about laps .
the district administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago , an older wife named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina didn &apos;t leave aside from Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Asia . &quot; she tells her .
Gal@@ ina wants no financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she instead supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells us that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this constantly - everybody is dealing with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appeared on the balcony .
Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes .
I already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children lived in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war started .
every day she rec@@ alls the thorn in front of the war .
despite relatives , who live in central rus@@ sia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke off ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) recently .
we want to build a house there , but that will last something , &quot; she explains .
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kindergarten once was once , they hold pigs , cows , h@@ aul@@ ers and chickens .
she tells us that it was initially a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , they lost their fears .

&quot; we don &apos;t be afraid of the dark road or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this buildings were destroyed during the war .
indeed , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there were hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day , as the city and the war once were once . &quot;
when our conversation incl@@ ined to the end , a little boy is passing by us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball is flying out of the window and another guy ch@@ ases him back .
he plays with the ball , who then rolled the hill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one group of children is now pursuing a ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while they are running , some of them throw rocks on the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for in@@ comprehen@@ sible in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico the &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants at its long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 at the site of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is situated at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a coral pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and golden colour earrings in ted@@ dy bears .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather she herself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with grinding , crum@@ ble walls and beds made of metal .
there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage in the anter@@ oom .
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to call it : &quot; mom Africa !
where are you on Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time this year .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard .
she wants to reject anyone .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medicines that they do not pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that drew off from long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived before a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ism ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States to make it normal for the first stop in South America and move towards the North .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together the distance and that Afri@@ cans already speak on What@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of its leader has lived Michel@@ et before in Brazil and worked as a construction worker in construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy has been we@@ aker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been guest since months on Mama Africa : he sells SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; mom Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he replied smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests are often sending text messages when they are gone to greet them , or to report them over the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught chicken , chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope to travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
the other end of the city leads a sl@@ ack@@ asse to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valencia and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman , and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants too expensive .
he started to help them , having a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar &apos;s night .
at the moment , there are 25 people , mostly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert , and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula arrives from Central America , other residents open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to presses his money without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all @-@ stone , has offered it their roof .
a few months later the family lives , and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the courses , the trav@@ ellers consult their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother her album tells her in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair stain@@ s that you made a r@@ in , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and elderly .
she laughs sad@@ ly , while she introduces herself briefly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repe@@ ats each time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users to the end of the user .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users of the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification where it refers to the district government to install a surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said to have access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities must also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app shortly after they had replaced the app , messages with a private We@@ Chat group had changed .
the police informed that the app could determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists , and would follow together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , of online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can naturally be used in various ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could manipul@@ ate state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while announ@@ c@@ ements news about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often no@@ ster@@ ous for those who live in remote , sub@@ mer@@ ging ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often classi@@ fy extreme interest and monitoring measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ less internet connections .
on Twitter based Media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main Country China &quot; ( free @-@ charge ) , the cen@@ sored news in China published , showed photos of a check@@ point where police sent the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately , if they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a return for the technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( d@@ amm@@ ers ) also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and therefore get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the statements of the City @-@ party Council to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content .
all government officials , authorities and related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office at the operation of their computer and communication equipment .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on June 27 in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police register .
int@@ ent is apparently any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible outcomes included , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
one single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane share his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look forward to and imagine that you &apos;re all alone in a place where everything is missing .
everything has gradually revealed and revealed a truth , which is clearly recogni@@ zable , both within and from outside .
one that makes its name all honor .
one that struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow Met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality comes back and look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and perform@@ ers - turn the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt resolve themselves in smoke and you will be conscious of your existence , even if Earth is caught on the axis of the monster , you will be sure that you are caught between walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone have built .
they have arrested me and my father thri@@ ce , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to form@@ ulate &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the head of security services it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he presented his power to proof , destroying even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were destroyed during a peaceful protest such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough so that the city collapsed the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts of the city sought after , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , rainy , in the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city , which is assigned to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night , things were calm down , after the power supply stopped to work in the quarter .
I pier@@ ced the silence by scre@@ aming several times of &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my home roof .
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we bund@@ led us to a splendid picture that fulfilled my expectations .
in such a moment , you are aware that you are liberated the spirit from the lamp , but it simply interests you in the smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey can swal@@ low here - nothing can return to your voice , after you have made it all the way up to the office of security services from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me listen , as you cry &apos; All@@ ahu &apos; bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only brave enough to shout if we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his eyes filled eyes upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you know what to look in my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was on my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought you forgot my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think , I have never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and I don &apos;t regret one word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father equal to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal with this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gest@@ ure of this curse Satan is up to me today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture that I was abandoned for months .
I scre@@ ams the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself .
afterwards , through the farm and into the second office that leads through a gang to the single cells .
I create all details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise , they probably got a larger cell this time .
I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and can immediately set me without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I handle an old @-@ tested communication method : to beat the fist against the wall .
I learned that my cell fin was a &quot; drow@@ sin@@ ning &quot; was .
after long hes@@ itation he answered me eventually .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was an respected man @-@ aged , who is similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , there are no markings of facial features , and doctors are not available here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers links its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
investig@@ ators assured me , they would leave him if I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to distribute all these cro@@ ws , that lab@@ elled at the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
I can always shout &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from the distance .
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always to kill the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that Black saw the color of corruption , until I saw the yellow light , which presented the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ play on 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
that was the secret cl@@ auses : in order to protect the State security in front of us and to prevent the terrorists , they talk in al@@ a@@ wit@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al creation card and prov@@ oked the close view of their world view .
this is not a house , which is not a land ; it is a curse to turn the co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ an in a hero .
I cared for the hearing room and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can attack so much more important with your life than to protest those daily and protest on demonstrations , which will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to answer , not to answer .
I can really not say exactly , when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly interview for me became an ordinary communication medium .
when and how that happened was irrelevant .
some voice in me told me that I had to be punished if I had to be punished , although I had done nothing to make this punishment .
working in all its diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; confes@@ sion . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe , which probably dates from the clo@@ ths .
your hen is rub@@ bing against your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you cannot keep your terr@@ ors .
my cry was not enough , so why they ex@@ position the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked whether investig@@ ators had been working as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had flo@@ pped four cables to each other , to present us , out of their sight , great invention of a huge cab@@ al .
within a single hour , three of them altern@@ ated , whereas I was still in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice , which I heard to cry out .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling , and no delight in it , which is why he served next to an electrically charged staff .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my semi @-@ naked body , stretched out on the floor , was the perfect power station .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay down myself again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens up and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I reply with the voice of an exhausted young people : &quot; my lord , my Father has to worry about . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you &apos;ll be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photograph was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is bringing the most of his time inside ; sometimes he stro@@ kes to his canvas , even to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely , is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nic@@ ot@@ ine lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has heard them since 1967 ; the year that Israel was forced to complete his occupation of the West Bank and had to flee from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ ae ( about : farmers ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activity that turned up to the conservative majority against gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and Rap@@ music .
with his music , often disper@@ sed by topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian Refu@@ gee . all these issues can not only be found in his hom@@ etown Amman , but also in cities committed by Damascus in Syria to the whole of San@@ aa .
at the age of 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not constra@@ ined in his thinking and may be according to people &apos;s participation , who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it does not exist openly , it swe@@ eps a special circum@@ stance against US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who try to do in war zones , something with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Refu@@ ge@@ ant &quot; - so he himself was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own living circumstances , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is empha@@ sized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sh@@ ook in water , it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast to sunset from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also says that the public consumption is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for this to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ ing hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the sl@@ ums are lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when you cast a look at the neighbouring countries .
it is therefore easy to avoid essential things - as in public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in prison .
recently the Interior Minister Jord@@ anians had cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila , already for the second time .
some parliamentary elections support the Islamic State Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual fron@@ tier Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , argue and the main reason for the concert is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with CNN , the members of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had to be cancelled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim also the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world , is dangerous activist , which im@@ poses strict legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila appreciated the Jord@@ anian nation as a &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to use for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be easy to be fair rhet@@ oric , but actually an increasingly challenging reality in Jordan , clearly reflected in the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs plant .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b made traditional nor@@ ms to body , having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a manifest unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
she is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should have confidence .
over the past years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ orable &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official out@@ ward .
human Rights Watch , according to its peak , the number of hon@@ ors in 2016 reached its peak ; however , the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women , victims of murder or domestic violence , to provide a reasonable kind .
according to a law on breaking control of the year 1954 , women who are subjected to the danger of intern@@ alised violence , &quot; and for their release , often a years @-@ long bureaucra@@ tic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music is very popular with great popularity and is known to rep@@ ay even from themes in his country for long as tab@@ u .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , dreamed that he is his music that is full of explic@@ it accus@@ ations on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was told politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b accepts the question of Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are politically at the heart can continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and each other is it . &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words , &quot; that can be what you want . &quot; be faith or not believe , het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still were cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ age program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without in@@ cis@@ ions , but it was only a working version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ bian , a poet from the eighth century who has remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ bian , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can &apos;t he do that ?
the real problem so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ ctic kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive votes are being sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teaching association with the grounds that they had expressed in social media critical to the problems associated with the deep in the country .
given that , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs show is only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to act a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan .
for him , progress is an up@@ lifting and take @-@ out . Jordan gave M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila again for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - there is no slow , need and inner alter@@ ations . it is certain that these changes take place every day at the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs also dre@@ amt , of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he has not only dre@@ amt of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to live &quot; them . &quot;
perhaps the region is thinking about music , art and literature a real and basic op@@ enness - and not by bombs , stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and artificial type of democra@@ cies . at least he hopes .
until it is done , h@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to carry on , and consequently also resist .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which A@@ man belongs to the student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories to the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
one thought that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory says that the drums , the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years were handed over , in the armies of Japan in the Nor@@ theast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a couple of great seats , so we have a superb view .
you can imagine only how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al .
I have been watching the meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two fort@@ night cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ meter high hill car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rare were external appar@@ ition and body care so important as in this history , because they help to maintain the Peru@@ vian youth of crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdres@@ ser &apos;s hair .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us principal port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , has led to always more nor@@ ms in the experienced hands of hair@@ styles that can be recre@@ ated with them .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of Fris@@ eure &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there , experts predi@@ ct each other to show who you can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people against hair tools and instead of bad advice to get an apprentic@@ eship in hairdres@@ ser art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the interested possibilities , dozens of young people saw that they can seize a profession that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in March of the school year and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , wher@@ eon we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ llas

use with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love messages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guer@@ ri@@ llas &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published the International online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not much more important to bring yourself into aff@@ ection , aff@@ ection ?
exactly this question went missing the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation . she inspired her to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people encouraged to write letters to their letters .
just recently , their country was the place of an historic event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC guer@@ ri@@ cist Movement ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered to be the signing of the Nobel Peace Treaty , as promised that the President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
there is a long way ahead of Colombia , until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
Guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ ama , who had been living in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a war rhet@@ oric , and around the clock carrying their weapons in themselves , now they have to integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company again , who had used itself to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to guer@@ ri@@ llas , must take them into their ranks , and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colombia had to join together and would have to help integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former guer@@ ri@@ llas to welcome them again in the company .
the Campaign for the Campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ llas - who are then to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk to Kail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love to write on the Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those who forget it much unnecessary .
he plan , he told them to share his love with people this year , which needed the most urgent promises .
so the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former war@@ riors of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will demonstrate that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation in the camp to deliver the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC found themselves as they had done earlier to counter@@ act the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; says the Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of the Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after having passed the letters , a former war@@ rior led me to the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of cabin where the guer@@ ri@@ llas live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighting , who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pomegran@@ ator , a le@@ thal weapon in the thorn n@@ ap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered him , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
never before my life someone has written something like this , that &apos;s why I answer . &quot; I suddenly set the tears on the che@@ eks .
I embra@@ ced him , and sat down beside the pomegran@@ ator .
perhaps he was sorry for war , was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions of this battles , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep it and his six brothers in front of the famine . &quot; I never thought that someone would be forgiven for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have just learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace is , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
for pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC met a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as a war , and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years have we experienced , as the social in@@ justice by the State had been working on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves on a political party , we can contribute to design the society in this country .
for a goal of this size , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people , who had never heard the hearing and had no electoral law , and to know that the people , which I often seen as a monster , and even have learned people with beautiful feelings that were turned through their habitat and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality living in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and caused much harm , can give us a bit and a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the City Cal@@ i , following letter :
Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists were made that , after dis@@ armament , peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
as long as it ine@@ quality , hunger , and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be individuals who are ready to collect and protest to their rights , and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what breed , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all that dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , our contribution , and sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . among us that defend life as the foundation of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and im@@ print .
with terror , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat of a Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ worthy about the LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only on the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ y , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked to us what happened in the republic .
LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international headlines in front of several months after the reports were published , which the ev@@ ap@@ ing , torture and killing que@@ ens of men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; it threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities that took susp@@ icious men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they grow up , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no safer place for them , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ yan &apos;s gender equality , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
in fear of her life , she moved to the United States last time .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ wife , who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he was a friend of whom I thought he would have been a friend , a copy of my documents and spread all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . so there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos taken from my documents by the whole What@@ s@@ App round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing just some shopping bags from the seat of my car I heard a men &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
then I heard a sentence , but this time at Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you honor the family , you shout ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke last end in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had taken away everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had vent@@ ured two samples in my right lung level .
OC Media : in which ambul@@ ance you have been placed - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name . but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am thank@@ ful to him that he was resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
I got threats of threats last February .
they cried to me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relations .
the requested to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I have to prove it up without the streets ; others wanted me to open up in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ y and I say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only bad things , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a rope around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a license plate with a 95 .
after it had happened to the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends examine the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to pay their names , but I want to say that I don &apos;t remember them all ; they really helped me .
I left the country with her help , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought her , without registration without notice , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the rub@@ b@@ ish .
arrived at and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a foreig@@ ner .
I plug the SIM card in my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you warm@@ est in safety , just because you have left the country ?
our people know you know in which hotel you &apos;re on . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that really was my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality . however , this is a table theme .
some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ us elements I still bear in myself .
so very much I would like to overcome this soul barrier I can &apos;t overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we ch@@ att@@ ing with camera , I give myself effort to see how the person reminds you of her past - so on my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed ?
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had eaten a half month in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an had not been arrested and tortured , but also that all the Ram@@ ad@@ an Ram@@ ad@@ an could wait to wait , and he didn &apos;t lock a new wave .
most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives .
thus , mine , they probably invite the relatives , these are the problem with the affected people and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction .
OC Media : even now gay men are held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it wasn &apos;t very many .
if , above all those who have no rich relatives or that were dropped from their relatives to put the Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so you can present them later than terrorists .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim that they had attacked any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , they are targeted to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this now only an assumption or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for a half months .
he says that many people have gone in this prison after their be@@ ard was grown .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they just took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was involved as those people were taken .
until now , they were not introduced as a ban@@ dits , so far , there were no reports yet . we assume that such actions are quite possible .
why would one shouldn &apos;t have this man allowed to shave ?
do you know whether these persecu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , had already been found in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair for long time .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny before 2003 when I still lived there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
Russia was originally intended to lead us to the &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lization &quot; but finally cast us back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were hat@@ ched ; I had coloured eyelashes , wore a tube and short tops .
the safety ministry of the Sch@@ aria has never made me a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like mine hit .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phr@@ asing : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; don@@ ot not on the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children , when they are doing so funny about sick .
OC Media : so just shut their eyes from you because they believed you are ill ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted , and never defeated .
OC Media : how long did it work ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on TV on mor@@ als .
he did not speak about us , but foremost to the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could sense how the people in the city began to change .
who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , contempl@@ ating yourself with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation existed in the republic steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you go to work now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ iter .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as a activist .
currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I have commun@@ ere with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize tea , mer@@ ging , I invite you to the hospital , helping them to get food cards .
I have no cents for this .
I discovered these people myself , when I cut off random variety .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you contribute to Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
that &apos;s exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ yan , who want you to do with foam in front of the mouth that there are no co@@ ils .
the Da@@ gest@@ an who have the Cab@@ ar@@ din@@ ers who have the Russians also have ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I am from there , so it is very pleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ed Muslims , go into the mosque and fast in the Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
you know , many think about Transi@@ identity of men who love men , and they believe that you are changing his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ sty .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact , different living adjustments .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not very sad at all - I just know I &apos;m now myself .
local groups war@@ n an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ale within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi Community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ als .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th came the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi Community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed for his own assistance to stay in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi Human Rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
on YouTube , a video stopped the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people manage to delete the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
the local sources , according to the local sources , were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide which had happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists in front of the spot that more men might take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - has hung .
their stories have one thing in common : these were all family ancestors , who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families and pursue a safe work .
Arabic Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where most of the Arab ancest@@ or @-@ Nazi community living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to dispute its living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in the oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most experienced and valuable useful areas for Iranian farming .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continue to be slow , and the local population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and empt@@ iness .
the Iranian regime denied involvement in the Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Arabs systematically work@@ places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a wide variety of tribes , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian Gulf , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroying local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate under the Arab A@@ ci@@ ale @-@ young people rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian @-@ General Director for Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is completed a job that completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and completed a degree of 45 % .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... &quot; aimed at destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ ral and human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ moral among young Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become worse since . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arabic discrimination in the integration process :
since officials and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arabian workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi is depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aimed to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their lives outside their homeland .
there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to Ah@@ w@@ azi , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated in the workplace , sof@@ ter than speaking of Arabic language or the carrying out of Arabic clothing .
in view of the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must bear , human rights activists alarm , before the situation is explo@@ sives .
it remains to wait , whether the world is wake up and knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not I identified with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the object of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , so many women - especially white women who design@@ ate himself as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of movement .
they even put well through scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all Fem@@ inist * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money in spite of the same education as men .
that women are still under strict observation , if it is about what they are able to do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards are still taking care of making women sooner or later in various sectors of life on a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender are still ongoing across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is conscious of me and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak of skin color , on rac@@ ism , black C@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I do not mention , as we have always been mis@@ used under r@@ att@@ ling and discrimination ; as well as outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent .
however , they are all united that women - all women should come together to lift their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; , to get the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institutional form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are subject to black women .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties and origin of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ ears and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women .
on one hand , I want all women , all men and all men each have any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect myself as a black woman to take into account the white woman who ref@@ uses to take refuge in their thinking , which refers to both the sex as well as to the skin color of one person .
I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight over my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sp@@ ies that always rejected me and countless other black women and again rejected .
in 1851 , so@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in their speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature .
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ centr@@ ist program .
I will no longer try to define white women the importance of irrit@@ ation of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to revi@@ ve them .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to bor@@ row women in different ways and bor@@ dered from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in his name .
I prefer to dissolve myself fully and completely eradi@@ c@@ ate against femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever , that we define black women to our own ideas and give us into the Sp@@ are , which will be created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ Wom@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves ) , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately calling , having read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement from which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I am recognised because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither over@@ taken , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of an content @-@ sharing agreement this article is again published here .
Nabil Mus@@ a again travelled again in the past 7 years - usually with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special issue through the Kurdistan &apos;s region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effects of pollution in his community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers in Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ epers Alliance - which is committed to protect the rivers , streams , rivers and rivers in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the dr@@ um@@ ness and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bi@@ l , Iraq , filmed and published .
the emphasis on their work is followed , little major sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ operating video photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their way .

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ ter ) that rel@@ ates over the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become a non @-@ violent man .
since the end of its relationship a little time has passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed nothing for abuse , the ac@@ compli@@ ent display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not profit .
a few days later , the second woman moved back her ad .
the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are ever able to report , they generally don &apos;t receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also finan@@ cially dependent on the men who abuse it . this also explains why only 20 % of women who admit to be victims of violence at all in law en@@ forcement agencies .
content 1 Pun@@ ishment and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ abuse and a Legal System , which is not subject to nothing worse laws : good approach , lack of implementation , and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them .
the figures available , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the district At@@ tor@@ ney , 9@@ 600 ads were arrested for domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of ads were killed by women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peac@@ ekeeping force . 86 % of women came here .
in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
however , this statistics do not show the true mag@@ nit@@ ude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen female minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di only few of these crimes are also shown . &quot; on any woman who are ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who are ref@@ unded for physical abuse will be ref@@ unded , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not their own criminal off@@ ences , law en@@ forcement agencies can not be adequ@@ ately documented , as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone there were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country alone .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence caused by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ taking anything
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the solid friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , it didn &apos;t want to do that , but then , however , it was to be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mariana is 28 years old and nothing more with Carlos . but for two years she wore the psych@@ ic violence against women , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zable :
I have never thought that I would have a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
when I read about it before , I always thought that that only women happens to be sub@@ mis@@ ed because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name , they wrote posts on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ults and several attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , among them Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically , whether he had ever raised the hand against her and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users ask Mariana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te CRE@@ O network , which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as Fall , everything began with mental abuse .
their weal@@ thy partner even managed to convince her , to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started to beat them .
Victori@@ as ads in the authorities remained without a result and even from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a process against her former partner who developed into an in@@ war@@ dly judicial struggle between Paraguay and her homeland , in which it mainly went to money , power and influence of her former Partners .
influential laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ab@@ uses of abuse is a way of resi@@ du@@ es and a struggle against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also provides great problems in the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # Princip@@ al ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Un@@ less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law sees the Fem@@ izi@@ d draft to explain and har@@ den harder as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ations in some point was altered to win even the MPs to win the law , who feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently forbidden in Paraguay , and will be punished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill had intended to cost the majority of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) process costs , which have to carry the victims of violence at present , if they just want to report and receive a safe place to raise up the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the leg@@ islat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial means for this purpose :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ as is seen as part of a human relationship .
here , a re@@ thinking takes place , that violence is no longer regarded as a normal one .
those who keep silent in the face of these facts are guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators are dead .
we have to restore so long before mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law passed in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered . among other things , one passage was canc@@ eled against the partners in cases of domestic violence towards reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes are apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor to attack his victims .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a big blow .
this article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ ter ) that rel@@ ates over the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
independent Media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper still subjected to assault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was locked because of the decision of the Information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ an authorities signed an independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sul@@ t@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to prison , where he served a year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and tried to trial later .
Oman has been gover@@ ned since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power after he had placed his father , Said i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Defence , Minister of Ministers , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s dom@@ inion is characterized by the labour force of security forces , especially the domestic intelligence service , the public freedom , including freedom of freedom , limit and human rights , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and imprisoned .
the authorities protect peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , in order to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and closing three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its foundation in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to the hands of justice . &quot; it went to corruption in the Judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri was arrested , member of the ISS before the Special Department , and was arrested at his arrival from the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS announced the Deputy Editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ an arrest .
the newspaper was closed for an in@@ definite period after the Information Minister had given the directive that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri took place before the court .
the court sentenced three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both sentenced under other things because of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ excav@@ ation of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of injury of a public ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 om@@ ic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year vocational ban on the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , following the use of &quot; a information network to spread the material that could pose a danger for public order . &quot;
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was established on 22 August 2016 in prison for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acquitted Al @-@ Ab@@ ri in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but den@@ ounced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was sentenced on 10 April 2017 to ban his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j continued in prison , where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also adopted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court to reg@@ ain Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper looks after attacks by the om@@ an government .
on January 8 , the Information Minister received a statement which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and putting the Minister for another time against the decision of the Appe@@ al Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again .
the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the Press freedom was injured in Oman .
for further injuries , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to make its operation .
due to the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the incar@@ cer@@ ation of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an authorities are still not ready to cause an extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ ic authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists may follow their work ;
3 . protect freedom of press in the country and
4 . in the circumstances of certain circumstances , human rights def@@ ending and journalists in Oman resol@@ ving its righ@@ t@@ ful human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ailing measures , including geri@@ atric on@@ ic@@ ans .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture will be done with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need of local medical research , there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vaccines , which cover the special medical demand on the African continent .
diseases like AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have widespread impact than elsewhere , and lack of investment for exploring these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists in Africa can be used in establishing its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the central control centre in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
when post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania he insi@@ sted on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and on mis@@ understanding the media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I supported the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also rigid a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we use only solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay recipient , instead of being mo@@ vers .
the solutions we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here .
g@@ v : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable researchers for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come back here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import from other countries .
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interesting , but only a very limited scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need for special academic education starting in any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , exploration of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the basic access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited to the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky appeared originally on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been bre@@ wed in the USA since the 1980s .
its company provides 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant produced by NASA astr@@ onau@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been placed only by his own down@@ fall and the question , how many sal@@ es@@ ars can get , limits limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or curved leaves .
over the past years , more of such patents have been registered to more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ot@@ t@@ ens@@ ity . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environmental protective and expert for food security provide the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on is still a salad , but he still needs longer , since its work is always worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like being a rock bro@@ il in a river , around which I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it is a bre@@ ach with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far .
and when they stand before court , no one can breed more than new sal@@ es@@ als because all features are already patented . &quot; it thus makes as good as possible and tries to recover those features that he wants .
however , it is very cau@@ tious and ende@@ av@@ our@@ ing to use any material being protected as intellectual property .
it is also connected to a movement that is becoming increasingly bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
the astr@@ on@@ aut of the International Space Station ISS have bred red co@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the variety Out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and ate . there is being tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds like that , as the movement from the IT field would come and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that offers alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and properties are not protected as intellectual property , and so for plant @-@ bre@@ eders are useful .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders may also commit that others may use them desper@@ ate seed freely .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others who want to breed their seed , to breed so own sorts - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ente .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ zed Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seed is giving him a role in major interaction such as biodiversity , rights of peasants , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to explo@@ it the latter , not or only little by using seed with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; for example , we want to buy control over the seeds , &quot; he says and takes care of the process of environmental sustainability , such as for example on farms markets , should also know the way that this vegetables is bred , threatened .
food sovereign wealth without seeds is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to make other their seed freely available . so , in contrast , it stands to patented seed and plant characteristics .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i Supp@@ orters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , because the natural pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is always restricted to restricted , un@@ break@@ able .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has been engaged in her thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the card features are protected as intellectual property , making it either used for plant bre@@ eders either .
for other plants there are still no such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that mass@@ aging plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ wise
plants become so strong that they feature targeted features - of such , through which their taste or their color improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
ad@@ versaries of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders decreases by more patents . genetic diversity is currently unnecessary as ever before , as the changing conditions are un@@ predic@@ table due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto &apos;s spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to recognise that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with a total of four Gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States , the company set itself the preser@@ vation of the genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not contra@@ di@@ ct that intellectual property preser@@ ves other bre@@ eders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of Plant vari@@ ets innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result .
such protection is so un@@ inhi@@ bited innovation , but promotes it to be provided by public more materials and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees this differently : 20 years to wait until a patent was christ@@ ened , they certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources are always a general good . it also should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aries are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers easier .
this is what drives us , and it is impossible to us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of itself to patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics itself .
they originate from themselves and , as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; anyone bre@@ aching a variety , also cur@@ b its own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , in which cultivation of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , breeding in its varieties of agriculture .
my concept is just gent@@ leman . &quot;
while some moderate @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Monsanto are ) patents , they can also survive the most smaller seed companies , either reject it or hold it for too expensive and therefore do not re@@ war@@ ding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in its breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders is innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are patented .
I need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one has been protected for 20 years before the competition , making it easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
although the US seem to be a leader in the open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading throughout the world quickly .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as professional organization in the area of resources , an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program works with farmers together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports it to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organization co @-@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which ultimately has a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding themselves differ from land to country , essential for O@@ ss@@ i obligation not simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally far@@ med plants should not be patented . thus , it talks to the present practice of the European Patent Office , the patents are permitted to conven@@ tionally far@@ med plants .
however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is to the governments of Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the god@@ entation of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization currently has a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which is scheduled for the scheduled next year of the official start date .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , International Non@@ return Development aid ) US@@ C Canada and the Action Group to ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database to seed and bi@@ odi@@ vers@@ ität in order to publish a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - published a report . therein , they represent the possibility to exchange seed and improve seed policy , so that a stable supply can be ensured with food .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems is empha@@ sized - a connection , by the Lu@@ by O@@ ss@@ i hopes that it will soon become more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods are particularly respected , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to clear the human that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still unlock the content on the Internet .
this time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ nist .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt as well as the Arab world .
in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities have sharply critici@@ zed and promised to continue their work and effort for human rights in the region .
the whole Network for Human Rights Information warns : despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution to defend their goal , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities will be exhausted to overcome the blocking , and not admit . we hope to continue our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network in Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of website bul@@ locks . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ M@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access to the blog of Kolum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spread of colum@@ nist and articles he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , whom he set up in order to b@@ ypass the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
Blo@@ gger , the provider with which Zi@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video , as the police executed physical violence against two students .
his article mainly focuses on politics and human rights conditions in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada said to the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him :
that , blogs to lock is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaning@@ less for the world , it is , however , for two reasons it is for me :
1 ) It has succeeded to conv@@ ey the feeling of a siege arti@@ llery ; An arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , blocking blogs , and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to avoid c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave are the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) closed Egyptian authorities from 24th May to 06 . August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on the network of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers , through the conversion of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 we saw how the locking of Web sites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s started .
such a practice indicates the intention to block the government to block content and filters to allow access to the Egyptian users .
the situation will also contam@@ in@@ ert that the decisions are made behind closed doors , so the Egyptian population has no legal basis , so that they can proceed in court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the people are fighting .

day for day reports newspapers in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard designs .
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ old @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day is a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe &apos;s pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violence in Rio in the middle of the economic crisis , in the middle of the economic crisis , reached the highest level since 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice has even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
so for the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which it announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city will now be published .
the moti@@ ves for her decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual disorder , etc . everything , however , will be published by the civili@@ zed standard and what only happened in Rio will be called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to make known as journalists not our eyes from the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ in in a country that doesn &apos;t know the war .
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 countries , which are gover@@ ned by criminal organisations .
in the Editorial the newspaper writes further :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when it is distor@@ ted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police that only shoot and then asks questions to disgu@@ ise .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption during the police , whose target is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasi@@ l , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argued to design@@ ate the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is the opinion of a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to provide responsibility for the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , education and an historical and self @-@ pleasing neg@@ lect of public service .
reminder : the Rio de Janeiro state is greater than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the murder rate per state , Rio is at No. 16 , &quot; she writes .
the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , like C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the policy of security policy since years .
among these security policy measures the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one from the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela police station and stationed a unit permanently .
in the beginning , this resulted in a decrease of non@@ violent death . however , after several years the U@@ PP was supposed to protect the newly created police unit , which should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under fire .
on his Facebook page he cited the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his article published in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio are not defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the designation &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio will also have serious consequences for the human being .
for this calls on the state to use resources and ways that are typical for war . to this end , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; and &quot; distor@@ ted balls . &quot;
war , or her , F@@ act is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ elas continues to suffer in Rio .
one week it is now that the police inv@@ oked the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a police officer .
in the midst of all of these violence , this incident happened : a fruit mis@@ chi@@ er died as a consequence of shots , which fired the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the Research Institute , The Syria Institute , are in Damascus and surrounding areas of Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b , currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege .
the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly strong , where an attack on chemical weapons resulted in hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of the investigation of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebels , controlled by rebels , have stood under siege outside Damascus , leading to that people to rely on locally , or by tun@@ nels and inspection points .
by the years long block@@ ade , traditional food stuffs like meat has become un@@ reach@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a consideration , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a food @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the common , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its nutritional value , however , makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , subscription Nabil , said opposite the French news agency AFP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in homes and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that already has been fighting for three years to participate this project and pushed for his relief to win more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to mediate , 125 family knowledge for plant@@ ation of pilgrims , such as Dr. L@@ eila zu Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations in Can@@ Do .
the initiative is based on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ ages , locally produced fuel from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of pilgrims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked their quality and if they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small Pil@@ z@@ hof in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger basin . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach man the fung@@ us of different reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break the siege of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese For Justice for the Vic@@ tims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that took part in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ two people died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to that the government proclaimed the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , which caused 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry system , which monitors the forest surfaces by satellite photos , in 2017 alone some 500,000 acres of forest are burned - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
no Portugal is burning in the true meaning of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ ans ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter users divided pictures :
that is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insight into the city :
the se@@ clu@@ ded tragedy
the aim of the protest of Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people questioned what civil protection did not mean in the situation , the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al explained by the Con@@ federation of Portugal , the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co declared :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
these Sunday they did nowhere : there are dozens of reports from open roads that were surrounded by fires .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy as in June could happen again , because the streets were blocked very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in oil markets with high fire risk are demanded .
an extensive suggestion to the forest form , which brought the government according to serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ able by municipalities which saw the new rules as obst@@ acle for investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the ban on funds to self @-@ protection - that was an open door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; introduces João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environment organisation Quer@@ cus made sure that large surfaces with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of light combus@@ tible wood , as in a v@@ icious circle , according to the fires of this species always further spread .
to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal was on the 15th and 16th October , when residents sought to contact or tried to contact relatives who was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used the own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched by the developer João P@@ ina in 2015 to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and has been decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October , so that the servers pursued the attack on 400,000 users , which followed the fires , didn &apos;t stand out more than half a million requests .
even the founder asked for help :

during a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afgh@@ ans began through the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible war erup@@ ted between the various mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in groups , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair .
just at that time A@@ ha@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it then , she knew she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
in dawn , the young man should break .
his uncle would pick him up , and bring him to the wicked .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Mal@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt violent .
the Taliban came closer to the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara , leaving the country in direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ ha@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ ach@@ work . the work was heavy and made it ill .
then he took what was left from its low wage , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish bags with mort@@ ar that were harder than he himself to make his living .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran is characterized by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , which we worked as well .
there was no services and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open window , so we do not fro@@ ze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ ha@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ ha@@ af homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that divided twice a day of food in needy .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true , however , that the conditions that the asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special admission centers &quot; in the hands of impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording center , if it officially filed an application for asylum - which can withdraw for months after the registration of asylum .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af as well .
but his un@@ bear@@ ers of life helped A@@ ha@@ af soon coming from these conditions .
after several years of work in construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his total savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that he opened a second hostel after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Suc@@ cess Story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; after Venetian luxury - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucra@@ cy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , 20.000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans developed businesses , including cutting places , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff mostly made refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of restaurants tells about the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are far beyond the Italian restaurants and retail markets , and aim to go back to the country , which he had to leave for teenagers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country , and I cannot live happ@@ ily if I know my people suffers .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and must get the same options as everyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged plans for opening a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ vative technologies . &quot; so you can sell their crop cash on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this track .

the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill of bill , which fore@@ sees that users can use social media like Twitter or Facebook just after a registration at a government agency .
users would have to use to use social networks within six months of their complete submission to the authority of the authority stating their complete name , as well as their ID number .
those who failed to do this step may be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or the final sealing of a pen@@ alties .
the law , which was advertis@@ ed by sixty members of Parliament , is currently facing the legislative committee as well as the parliamentary committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another deputy proposal submitted a legislative proposal in which har@@ sh@@ ish pen@@ alties for the har@@ ass@@ ment of the President or a senior officials would be introduced .
under Egyptian law , the har@@ ass@@ ment of the pre@@ sidents and state institutions is already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the bill , such a deed would be dealt with prison and fin@@ es , so @-@ experts at the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law passes the law , this can be up to three years &quot; imprisonment for the condemned .
moreover , this would be a political climate , in which the right to free expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
an distinctive example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ moud &apos;s Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers , demonstr@@ ating violence against prot@@ esters that led to the military coup that led to the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .

recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on the 20th of May , due to the prison management of human rights groups , to put the def@@ endants from prison to the Court &apos;s cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ cane threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are united , hypo@@ cris@@ y of inter alia weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza shared the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdullah al @-@ F@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who also had been arrested during the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists agree to en@@ forcing documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ g@@ ation of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , according to the plan explicitly a controversial bill , supporting the business@@ men and during the former regime by dictator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused Am@@ nesty Law .
this document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , raises light on how the pre@@ fix plans will look for the support of the legislative situation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia dis@@ closed the nam@@ ing of his sources stating that by Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which repor@@ ters the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to new rules of the National Council of People &apos;s Republic of China , social media users need a permit before they write messages in social media .
in the regulations it is provided that registration is required with the full real name .
analysts assume that the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments can be achieved in Entertainment within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities are to apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese networks have proposed in the social media , these regulations are only selective to protect the civil journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do we see us in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?

in May , the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia locked the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat tran@@ scri@@ bed to the state government as &quot; organizer of the Information Protection . &quot;
