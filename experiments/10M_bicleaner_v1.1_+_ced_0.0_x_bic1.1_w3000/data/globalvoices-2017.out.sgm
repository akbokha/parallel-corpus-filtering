<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA for at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">How many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I've read American writers and operated his sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was born mainly due to an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stuff, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil-Magnum, who were the Supreme Court with judges who wanted his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona had only strengthened the admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived so inviting, whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always the way you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of conspinning people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very warmly love letter written about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his bottleniness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people react to his assertions and tuned in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won at Republican Presidential elections, was the highest number one ever reached by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigwig person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his electors in accordance with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic program, the people from all over the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Trumps did not agree with the title of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr that fought for life long for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still it fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who helped me with much patience and grace, and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by them embodied my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">As a bump of his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidates, she gave me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt about non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they were either given to his racism and fanatismus or because they were willing to oversee these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the trump-voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people, one of my friends, said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think of another way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these electors, of which most are white, voted for trump, because they want to recover control over a country that has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to rise a man who look down with contempt upon those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm.): as much as "Rejection of White against all other ethnicities"; pun from white in response to the White and Whiplash, as much as Schleudertrauma, as it was the great Van Jones, did exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world will appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always like, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country, as its president, elected twice the son of a Kenyaner, whose story he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election Donald Trumps, there's a huge part of the White America's promise and says: to hell with versatility, religious freedom and the entire term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who is fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of choice.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton had a word of word with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roars.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called, and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN."</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was pleased, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could no more place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Guerrero commune in the province of Oaxaca, in common with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played on both places, not just the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music who lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among the tourists, but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La Banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the municipality: one from children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has found their musical instruments with an opportunity to overcome them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is become the central concern for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, which is in one of the poorest provinces in Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and banker violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI means:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come together and with shining eyes and play in the Truly you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timbrel, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically up on the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital - on instruments, which are manufactured from reprocessed waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reproduced instruments which consist of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycled under direction of Favio Chávez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imiing violins, violets, celli, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made from the waste.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin music as well as music of Beatles, Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article on Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez is a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio, which he had never seen before: a violated violin was made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from readily available material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landlady Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance on:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who are living with him and of him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landlady Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational play from garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published a magazine for targeted information on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for shared use of contents.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liberia's waters before joining the other African coast.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly brought up and much inclined to welcome a bill of burglar to its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized themselves against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply refused anything," "", "Benedict Kiilu, an executive officer of the Kenyan fishing authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and persecuted." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was compelled to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia due to pillaging fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, governing criminal practices and protect resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">Alongside Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are six countries who were the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries who work together and work together. they exchange information and are each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, because it is extremely difficult to trace. this is illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing was once more disabled by bureaucratic hurdles, the actions occurred nowadays in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, individual countries can exchange or refine their lists, news about suspicious activity or details that had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive when moving them at the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to identify ships that fish in banned areas. even so suspicious driving trails can be discovered, such as those who suggest that a ship invites his captive fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the Idealcase, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fish license, where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, may be based on the basis of such information on the assumption of such ships in their harbours. what does the ships do not sell their load. and that they even could be forced to count of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's then about significant financial losses for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "" says Per Erik Bergh, Director Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a lawyer, which is supporting illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales, which lost eight members of the HISH network every year because of illegal fishermen, penetrate into eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, where the region is moving around the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying phasienames, fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "you can use the lack of international cooperation and make sure the weaknesses of a non-treachable control system gain" "", "says Long." "" "previously a ship was illegal fishing and a country could say 'You mustn't miss my harbor'." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legal gorhole attempts to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">There are criminal law uncovered, which had been distributed to fake licenses in Tanzania. there were ships who used several deceitful identities and found it has been traversed and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for the fight against crime, FISH-i can divide information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">Some of our investigations lead us fairly far into the networks organized crime, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system to help FISH-i to produce suspicious ships precise.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, helps prevent the illegal ships to spread themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fisherman use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, which also offers technical support and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be made by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system which links different information collected. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's Team African Nations can influence influence on the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown worldwide via the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "in addition to the neighbours, to get a better picture of it, who does what is doing - this is simply meaning," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which had to be exploited without licenses and hardly agreed with consequences, now they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH has now recorded a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats more licenses.</seg>

"" "" with safety, the aim is to allow more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "" "" says Copeland. "" "</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph in October: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship that was under the wrong flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used towed, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also reserved in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the take of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time, evidence that such a special, collaborative labour mode is actually working throughout the oceans.

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to visit the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine City of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano said now in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated that were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not wanted his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden, the same name as his father bear to bear to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he retained the secrecy for itself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that was in order.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, it is not noticeable that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I couldn't know that my father was a thief, a well-known and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendareriebeamter. during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of State terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence department, 141 in the La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had been friends with a boy, who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have been rounded up with one of the ERP.</seg>

<seg id="224">He told me, I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. because so my father had exhausted me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda chief, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'there the prisoners are tortured "</seg>
<seg id="230">My father picked me four times to La Perla, all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he made me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to advance. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - simply stood there.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little bit wrapped in a ceiling and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw it was a big clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were shut down and refrained me with an outpost.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I went in, and saw a song, being tortured on man.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a dirt and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable. the other end was fastened at the body of the person who had just been tied.</seg>
<seg id="241">They captivated a people with handcuffs to the bed, crossed it with water, and drove him a charge of 220 volts to genitals.</seg>

<seg id="243">The gestank there was terrible... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forgot this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were shaken with handcuffs and carried on eye.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, an civilians who also was indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a number of mattresses, on which naked people lay down with the face, they were all covered in hands and his feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the vicinity of the entrance, people kept silence on the mattresses.</seg>

<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this, because my father told home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra some rooms were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">"" "I know that" "" "Palito" "" "Romero struck a man there and killed." ""</seg>

<seg id="263">When you look at the map, see that they took about this track and then tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of substantiating a number.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into cuadra until the arrangement of the above came that they should be moved.</seg>

<seg id="267">The 'War' of war '</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things with home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time in the age I had no idea what the "war" - as they named it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later on the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that warriors are a bajonett or maybe military rebate that is fought against an enemy which one fought against.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if you walk in a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... steals, this is not a war of war, but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is Theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always wondered how my father, the head of security forces, could participate in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal and I answered: and you, whom you cut cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded anger, struck me, and cried, saying,</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, I will find you and roll yourself.</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need any others!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I found a photo of the back then I had a jacket and a roller pullover of wool. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothing to home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me to have been a pity on this crime. I replied, no problem, they can give me a burden, what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway, to say.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last abheinous act.</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I feel repentance.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if only once children have children, one recognizes the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you have expropriated throughout the dictatorship of humans. but what the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children abduct?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with her home, whose mother was killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have been simply put into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why can their bodies be disappearing?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families, to whom to pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abheinous act, which one can do to man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they fetched machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were broken and disposed somewhere - no idea, where. "you will never find anything," my father said.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i have seen how you have killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was even with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought, to show my father, was created during an interview when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him accusations because of all the atrocities which I had to do because of him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"" "then he suddenly said," "" "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt innumerated and asked me, why the whole Patriotism and the "Western and Christian feelings," which they allegedly defended, were really good.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I shouted:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you have killed people!</seg>

<seg id="320">Exactly that I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010, I received the first ad.</seg>

<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator of Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also that the local newspapers had to look carefully.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto protocol in Kyoto wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation.</seg>

<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-cast News made a little more detailed with the phenomenon of "awful" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounced as an inappropriate description of old motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are still involved in accidents, but certainly occasion to concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1.941 were caused by a total of 19,460 accidents in the year 2005, equivalent to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens killed 1.803 of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This puts its share to 17.7%.</seg>

<seg id="374">The Engrish.com website is a true treasure trove for these bizarre errors in English.</seg>
<seg id="375">Photo by Flickr user Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For transitions you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in the case of breast cancer. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - do not be in the starting language - do not be in the language language.</seg>
<seg id="379">This is what a French native language should translate from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language, which could make translations into English. this may be a lack of understanding for overputting, cost savings or the relatively low number of English motherboards that will learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign staff, consider translations of their own company. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is regarded as the best honorable, made for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbs and enigmatic phrases that are created by machelle translations, show that this technology can not replace human translators for a long time. this applies to some languages especially.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English wordations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that are often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable, or at least harmless. but by large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto's city hopefully uses a respectability source for their translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protest to take protests in the internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan internet user out that they had no access to the online station Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet performances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are also unaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters carried out the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositionist groups, reposed by Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court himself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was encapsulated, and recommended the users to get VPN (virtual private networks) to access the internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internetpages Venezuelan Provider is again closed.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay are popular with internet access, especially in periods of disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been tentatively scheduled for 2014 over protests since 2014. then, the Commission threatened them with fines and closure when they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as "appeal to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">I registered with no cable TV and informative national television channels me back at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Astonishingly that this is still more favorable than to buy two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed later that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by a blocking of the domain name System (DNS), but also two other online transmitters. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly passes their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Former research of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, revealed that the local Internet provider should sometimes use DNA. this is a technique, which determine the DNS server enquiries regarding certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds right or denied the request when calling to a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitolotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">On VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transmission was set on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera cameraman Elvis Flores, who was broadcast live in Caracas live in Caracas.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was found in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: so that the Venezuelans will continue to make access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a Criadita. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testimony of other Criaditas, which were just like they were victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report of Kurier, which is published by Global Voices with the friendly permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows," falling schools ") which is edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household, where they did not live together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Just before her studies at the University she returned to the house and heard how the owner's owner was full of pride on her. "she's like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga has never been treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she started working as a Criadita for the family. as Criaditas are called in Paraguay that are more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a great family with little money overgives her minty-year old son or her younger daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned, is that the children need to pay for many days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within a contract which you can't raise.</seg>
<seg id="425">These as Criadazgo described practice is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After finishing her studies, Alvarenga worked for an organisation for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She talked with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of criadazgo - collected Zeus, rechered and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated the Criaditas, guaranteed in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is the family that her daughter in the belief that they conclude their training in society, improve their position in society and can do something from themselves "to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who defends the girl with faith, justifies that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no training, and perhaps even starving.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is harassed, his family will only experience many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know thereof.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secret in paraguayan households, but has a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín in Caaguazú came to the hospital, her body showed traces of violent wounds. shortly thereafter, she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military-affiliated Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer at the population.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived in her house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">On the end of January 2016, Ferreira defeated Marín as long as a stick to Marín, until they suffered a fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">She stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep in the paraguayischen society in the Criadazgo practice for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They signed the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest in protest and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely distributed in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without any official documents, it is very difficult to control, under which terms boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a large examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want that Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes before court, the case of Carolina Marín could be judge - if the first time in the history of English is a case of Criadazgo ahead of court.</seg>
<seg id="454">Daily life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as a labour force, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, she had to register and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Your brothers now had to go all work and started to sell money on the street or on the market of sweets.</seg>
<seg id="458">They went all further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asuncion in the capital of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so, she had to share the time so that you still stayed some time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose early every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays she cleaned the fridge, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and the infected floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was done with learning, the more leisure time it had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because they had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says it was never starving, but did not get unlimited food. "I was allowed to collect more books from the home of the master's library as a meal from the fridge," she recalls itself.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a Liberal Party, which was part of the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some detention forced the landlord of Alvarenga, standing next to him and Editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media on the dictators of the dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he kept them intelligent, but didn't stop her." "" "the landlord had found someone who listened to, while he talked about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they did not allow me to visit my family, because they were the opinion that I was again" "" "bad habits" "". "so they supposed that Alvarenga belongs to the indigenous group of Guaraní, at home again their mother tongue would speak Guaraní." ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the formation which they had made to lose, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">However, it was completely clear that she got for everything they had paid by them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school, Alvarenga was discriminated. "one thing about which almost never talked about are mobbing and the shicans, Criaditas are exposed to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I could not charge anyone home. I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time, where friendships develop, I felt very clearly that I was not one of the group.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian Parliament approved a bill of draft law on regulations concerning the use and payroll of social networks. "</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by the Parliament, user experience and social media must be registered in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a job would then be established, which in order to give citizens a permit to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the Law, user within the site would have to register with their correct names and personnel numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If this will fail to do this, it could bring a penalty up to six months "imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application which is on the Internet and used to communicate with others through the voice, video language and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is passed if there is no indication of how Egyptian authorities can raise the user's registration. unclear is also how they should make those who account that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament of Parliament and sponsors of the law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user name and users received a user name user name and a password to come through the firewall that is blocked by the firewall. "</seg>
<seg id="510">That could mean that Egypt is planning to direct a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it's not known so far, that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "senior sciences") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly agree with the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they are nonviolent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, then it means that it will establish a powerful monitoring system to filters out citizens that apply a permit or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to carry out a trial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed under the legislative elections and the Constitutional Committees before entering the debate in the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft "is consistent with a pro-military thought in parliament in which the sense is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration on the frame is present," says Raodate.</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of the region, in the northeast of Iraq, the veteran owner Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation in Nature have to protect the govarian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger leopards, which strike through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to wilderei, loss and fragmentation of their habitat, and they are always less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video shows, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the free game is low and goes against zero. as the team is therefore fixed at the video for a recording of a large cat in camera shots, Raza broke out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza inspires another side of their country, which is not only in war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and an educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi).</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the conservative daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the Northeast Japan, had been achieved to rebuild the life of those who were affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a certain prefectures in Japan's northeast that both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring suburbs of Fukushima and Iwate were enforced, because the tsunami had to vanish all the coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima prefecture had a nuclear accident, so alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo show from local point of view which advances six years later to rebuild the life of the local government.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of Japanese reconstructions as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (up to the end of the land, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">In the three prefectures, Miyagi was posted, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is the final light in Fukushima with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of containers of containers, evacuation of containers of containers (suppressed, casetsu juutaku) in the final spare country.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in containers of containers.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the Fukushima evacuation of Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuation, who were home to the disaster in containers have been moved in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and daily life in the three-affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine that 1074 from 1100 schools have been affected by misfortune, their gates is open until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fisheries in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation in Fukushima, only 30 percent of fisheries admits have been rerecorded in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, has moved in the three prefectures of agricultural land large-superfood.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of land-destroyed arable land of Fukushima, are in the "nuclear plywood" zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, the tourism has thoroughly recovering, but also here, Fukushima remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist deposits in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent at the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, only 75 percent can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared to the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine the overall picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys under the local population and among the evacuation by. they asked them about the state of reconstruction and, as its empathy changed towards the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that still not enough in disasters associated with disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper gave their attention to the position of evacuating Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disaster relief, nuclear accident, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Out of 160 000 evacuation of Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people, back after Fukushima, in a permanent sparrow homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants outside of Fukushima in their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophic areas most of the evacuating areas are more than 50 years old. they have to come back in right containers because efforts have to compete for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. here, these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences first seem to be bigger than the commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while, one often tells us that more than it seems to be at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important since they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remember that the world finally is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly this global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with topics related to reporting often less attention than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the commonalities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egheri explains how the love for music has been thinking about the lack of common language skills during a trip in the rural China; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the German university of Goiás, has suffered a brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors carried him on Saturday this Saturday and now have put it into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local artist journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus who spread rapidly in Brazil for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures there is also the face of the police officers to identify with an impact stock. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">Following the incident the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended until the final examination of the incident was suspended from the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers when he performs in Goiânia with its impact on the face of students Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer let a police examine and landing at the intensive care unit, his face would be six months long on TV and the whole suppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, distributed by Luiz da Luz, distributed by Luiz da Luz, how Mateus is attacked by police officers and several paramedic shortly afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experienced a wave of political force: here the activist Guilherme was assassinated by his father, only to criminalise the Occupy Movement in Secondary. and now we have been studying the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked on the intensive care station, after having attacked by police officers who struck him with a buck.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police transfer</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police paragraphs last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers were among the protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, rubber-fin and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to abandon violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media protests have failed to focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a windshield.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo adressed specifically about a broken glass window to illustrate their cover pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">However, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus in a fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a broken shutdown than the protests of thousands of people that serve the defense of a special issue.</seg>
<seg id="623">This is necessary to recognize, if one is strictly disappointed against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" receives a absurd, unresponsive meaning, and the typical violence of the military police are dealt with headlines with the title "demonstrators on the confrontation with the police."</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of Álvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The national congregation of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as a central Central - on Spanish Zuckenstein, regardless of which there is no notable sugar harvested on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago, when the activities were layed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the replacement, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the scaffold of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo veteteran who rises at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar tube industry does not smoke his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, after long inactive time, because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds me exactly that in Mañalich would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane resistance has already resistance the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the bad administration decisions, and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more modern.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane kicked off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"" "" "" "the reduction of sugar cane was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and hardly competitive for the country." ""</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane and the sugar crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, the sugar price increased again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report" "" "Landsperspektiven" "" "by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will go down with safety in history," "" "this was the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the Sugar Factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the stagnation of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene is known as a soldier, talking about the closure of the factory, the word that he repeats most, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same mind: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first leap year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially registered documents, which would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed, the mailing sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could make any escape.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was paid and the letters were getting more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the nursing factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still used sugar pipes," he assures us.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was opposed to his will at the shutdown of the factory in which he helped, involved.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part, which he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial sector developed by Cuba and most important workplace producers was extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases there were no alternatives for the work areas and services that were generalized in the municipalities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammut speech of October 21, 2002, the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would be well underway.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the community of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better, when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or rather than they began to beef it, they also heard that road to asphalted, this also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without a work in the region, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search other factories.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youngsters use Hip-Hop to express yourself and maintain their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording of a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths of the First Nations communities in Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do with hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour we bring mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to accommodate youth groups, songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by Pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in Montreal with ten cree communities and then worked with the Cree hip hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop proves that the young participation in our conversations subjects such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable" or whatever is to come in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, where the young people are the main actor.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the Kitbukalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not resolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important to the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the impact of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the chorus will be sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved a little help by Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop Group that gave them a Stronhe in dialect Eastern James Bay cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebookpage of N 'we Jinan, Strophhe is available in notation, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes, I feel like nobody ever would like to be interested in</seg>
<seg id="706">"" "" "" "but I'm trying to go further on earth my days." ""</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you'll take away our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how to live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and continue our youth as well</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus, they can do what they determined by the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every Restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what is happening exactly on the menu, close to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (in the amount of food, "Plastic models of dishes") are displayed by each dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers look at these plastic dishes, and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">The Kappabashi district of the Kappabashi is a variety of these small companies that create those plastic dishes that documented the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is turning now in conspicuous cell phones and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new with plastic dishes decorated with plastic straps, as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were turned into kitten collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some shocking fridge magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food positions will increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, who is holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing return to the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designer allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura and Lachswine is used, a popular topping, served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example colleagues or family members unpleasant to surprise.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile support has the shape of melier ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and molybdenies from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skitrile plastic dishes can view you at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # (for the worm).</seg>
<seg id="743">If you want to learn more about the origin of this trend, then you will give you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is devoted to the exposure of the restaurant industry. as for example, the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug trafficking in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly occurs in statistics. however, this mirror does not affect the extent of human tragedy that brings together this battle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa-Kartell, thronged the stories of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, barely any one looks to those who have learned to live with pain.</seg>

<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime lets us not just fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The implications are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if stores close because they are threatened by drug dealers and many municipalities have to drive a lot of kilometers to buy something so simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" will explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We don't just have to show the faces that are afraid of fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state control.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts of stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading of animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have already known illness and sensory journalism now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the titles pages with pictures, which actually only originate from a textbook for criminology or act of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes, I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes further:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is great. and it's not normal that people will hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of offenders if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, this is what would those who have lost someone who have lost someone and those who fear that something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are going to blot numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inelessness of the people is unbelievable for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour place to be justified they were "attentive."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they're trying to intervene that they will be spared by such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of extortion in the main town: like a family with threats of threats." it describes how armed criminals were killed for month money from their business, until they had not only destroyed the business, but also had torn her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost, and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are apart from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She finished her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because they don't know when they kill or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these awful days, if weeping would dissolve my profound feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the honored Generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, their parents' care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a watchman and he tells that he had to teach, how to make a egg cooked, potatoes, sprinkle with tortillas, and "Chichi," for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells the nine narrobs on his left side - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he only saw a few blocks away from his home, the bloody dead body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence was organised by the organized crime and fight against the already existing social issues in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the civil rights and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the public prosecutor's office was 3103 murders. this corresponds to the average of 8,5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Just a few stories still live in view of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" the data journalism project Narcodata set up in 2015, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the past four decades, in comprehensible manner.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rumor to unmask.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what is the years after the first time being immersed? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, tends to pass on.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been utilized misappropriately to cultivate tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This wrong copy of image and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denies not the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire to images.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second biggest country had been neglected and thereby devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous trades full of impact holes, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the gas vehicle fell victim to the victims.</seg>
<seg id="828">Bureaucracy representatives described a fireball, the dozens of dozens, including a cinemas, which was full of people watching the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses desperate and carbonated corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the divinity.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the dreadful scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of hollow bodies which are coiled on the ground while they look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been encapsulated several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but may not be attributed to real but not in the context of the tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the entlegenous Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities, to whom they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the numbers could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count bodies," said a population to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite imagery could be illustrated by the follow-up time.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win Boko Haram (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, as proof of the fact and the possible extent of attack was shown:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abnormative use of the DR Congo is only one in a series of errors; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was presented as a proof for measures.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments, such as this example, from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange joined the Muslim Rohingya in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flashmessage, published by the United Nations, those who were fleeing attacks, rape and some dead, some of them are burned.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported violence against the Rohingya, Posts appeared as the following, which brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidic Arabian News page, which was falsely maintained by President Myanmars Than Being, monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from the DR Congo to grasp this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news agencies, the AFP, as their source, were also falsely explained by being this statement, but had not been associated with the picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The world wide range of false statements</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false couplings submit to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere across the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse-looking picture," you can see how far information limits can be crossing.</seg>
<seg id="862">A reverse-looking picture search with the searchengine TinEye has found 344 pictures at 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixing sheet of private parties, platforms social media and communities as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have forwarded false reports, and some have tried others to unmask the forgings.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have examples of the abuse of misuse and associated with the respective countries, based on what they were published on which page they were published. thus, we want to represent the range of clearer than the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">From the below listed countries (which have also been connected together) several examples of abnormative use can be used.</seg>

<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who had been killed by Boko Haram, published by the Katholleisis Digital, has explicitly explained that the picture is not taken from the killings, but it claims that there is a "similar dschihadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture later turned into circulation with the Boko Haram massacre in 2015, the newspaper El Pais attempted to prevent it links to Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was twitched as proof for the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages related to this were not taken in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the target was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Portuguese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was allegedly written by a "Pater Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, it was translated into circulation, translated as this here in Vietnamese and declared it to the wrong message.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (montins) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the murdered victims of Christians or the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing does the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate how pictures are used in the context of these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers can't give these images to no longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there's a lot of people who have unintentionally inflicted the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of mismis- and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and lubricate the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of nonviolent pictures has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that this is receding from images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, concern that nonviolent pictures of readers and viewers disensitize and see them the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, the examined, how violent media contribute to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss the news media about violent representations in the news media, fact is that it is essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you'll have to mind thoroughly aware of the situation in which an image suggests, however, from context or completely misuse type.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. unmistakable) strives to offer language enthused a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in any language: they press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specifically.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others, which are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish swimmingesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, why a full explanation, and sometimes somewhat context are necessary to understand what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and Linguist by "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's VAT, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemüh to remember your parents in recognition of what we have tried for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the convenience or laziness that you feel after the sun has grown in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They disgrind other cultures, reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site want to publish more of this "unmistakable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now, despite a language barrier with somebody in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the stories of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported about another initiative of Steven Bird, the Untranslated blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get the language diversity of major cities and to appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or in Oakland, where TLS has already conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not given to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project is:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided, when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to be.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "during" "" "listening often to understand" "" "take these events instead" "" "to hear, to feel" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers choose their story first in their own language and translating or explain it to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their portrayal are that the auditing readership point out.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call up laughter and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language dafing. during this round, the story of history of Rassidatou will also take the opportunity to explain to their land typical customs of stories.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fable of Hoses and the Pavian in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he explains the meaning of his fable, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this that you speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide greeting he divides his feeling of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of the Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can operate with TLS in contact to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a reexamination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place at 72 million US dollars, took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017. the march was launched at the puertoria Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1158">This is their requirement:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico claims that politicians, banks and government agencies, responsible for the debt are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial inspection and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a solid, our working conditions, corresponding to the benefit of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will destroy and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt, which is not their own.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization, with a focus on socioeconomic development, a law for state responsibility, is an alternative to the existing authority.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Over five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has performed for an open network.</seg>

<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints' completed books within three to five days, lases out of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Instead (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and licensed here, contains a number of paragraphs that deal with free culture in the suppression of the repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the true cost is to which this is associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researcher and authors, who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to view over the nebula which surrounds our news feeds and to create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted by the Adra prison List in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us let us start thinking about their own destinies, actions, and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned this process of time-wise overbeliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the web developer of Open Source and Digital Activity has been in prison for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military setup to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military Police Bassel on the basis of a" strictly secret "had taken hold of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad government and used it by an alleged deaths against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in which access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologian and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes were predicting as the work that he started to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the trail of numerous civilians and merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS had everything that architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not yet close this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life to dream of freedom. he taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and talk to English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked others. he has taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also taught others as they use computer, at least theoretically, without having held a real hands in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a profiling which she wrote in the years 2012-2015 when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1231">That every one of the dangers is no matter,</seg>

<seg id="1248">According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) since the start of the protests in 2011, more than 65.000 people have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or sent under the regime by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organization Amnesty International has died in prison since 2011 at least 17.723 Syrians in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we are repeating our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: convicted of corruption and convicted director after dismissal release</seg>
<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mosambians responded to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workstation in the state apparatus, where corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This focuses on Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other defendants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for leaving over 54 million seas.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was originated from public funds of the Mosambik and its council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately requested his recovery in the company, which happened on April 19 then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic, who werved the application, there was no obstacle to refer to Cambaza, again to refer to his old item since the company did not perform disciplines after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people are not called the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to make the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clearly illustrate the absence of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, so CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know is that the company should have incorporate a disciplinary procedure against the contradicting trade.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company was silent, however, and caused no appropriate legal steps to use the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosambience social media, also rejects this behaviour as "resisting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has approved to be integrated into the company which he helped inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it's obvious: Cambaza will gladly be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradicted!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambians and Student of Political Sciences in Brazil says the director of no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded with such a way that the state has already been insulted so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morality to serve and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served herself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handy it was an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man, who was invited and finally condemned to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Makel, remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves also belong to Samora Makel's prison, not only as the first independent president in remembrance, but also as a sharp, single-cutting and - by side, prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he was more energetic, that "an ambitious human being is to be able to sell his own personal interest, too."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he doesn't change from its ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being is criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also backrest:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat 10 years old and freed.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network adopted its posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origins of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjectively "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or the delling (in Burmacy) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements have given an extremely abrupt connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism in this case, but the word addressed to itself does not appear automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that hosts, in which they discussed the use of the word, or have doubts about the use of his use, were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several burmesmical words with basic meanings, which have the same character sequences such as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spheres), 'Kalar Oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way, whether they might know how he could relieve his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase u la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin-win Htet is the opinion that it will be a radical nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook has to be analytical, before it extinguish all Posts who would like to spread racism in suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filter the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automatically will not understand what you write on Facebook users.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, is carefully researching and control the post by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spheres).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-minded nationalists, that hate speech language, will receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to complain nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is a powerful signal to all, which hate speech language, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">Social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of percussions are often a catch- and mouse game, with the user's social networks just start to use a new word or alternative editing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Kaat described how Facebook started to extinguish its posts when he only wanted to inform his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and told me the liken, post and sharing of contents for 24 hours, because the post "the Facebook community standards did not answer."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a wide variety of hosts of people who have no negative intentions or try to show their opinions against the speech-talking radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the mail, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook was supposed to have more about the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask Rat:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words become censored will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It also appears as if they have started this without any local context or technical support, and as words like "chair" or "inheritance curry" have forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they do not attempted to report the falsibly deleted poet.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a great turnover, this would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censor has provided for a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are doing so funny about Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts will be taken from the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that contained no hate speech but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and have an inheritance curry and watch a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just try to try, whether Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "post states" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious Fundamentalists, social networks have already used to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech is to heat violence in social networks in Myanmar in addition, especially in Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to carry out-out speech on his burmese sites under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of stimulating the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to stow on context than on code concentration initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The child's house is illegally illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country's parliament unanimously decided to ban this practice, so that the age of holier is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change of the heretic and Muslim religious communities held on practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersistent Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), a group that refused to mix representatives of various religious groups in the country, that the state should not interfere with the state that's not the maturity of maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This implies regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contract partner of the UN Children's Rights, the minors of younger than 18 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical agency confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitioning and social media movements which endeavoured to abolish laws for children's time, followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children before they should say, damned by their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition ensured for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts that the opposition would not agree to the bill of law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But early in 2017, the bill was decided against the child's health - despite 4 senators (including one woman) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree, and to proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators issued a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj therefore, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the famous Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Prior to months, Maharaj has announced his intention to make judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to resolve his pledge now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General of Paris Al-wi, a disadvocate of the law, it was quite legal if Maharaj wanted to proceed against the law, the most social media users wish to approach the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed to:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat if we, instead of speaking the discussion so general, in a way that can cause panic and wormness to talk about that the State, our daughters that protects them from great, hard-fed men who are against them in the advantage, would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children's before in different gradations are legally or still the norm, although there are laws which they say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, with the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopaedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and the fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques are used for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been locked out by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 was adopted after the Internet Act (Nr. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive Censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain locked, several mirrors are now mirrored (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updates).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform compiled all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (so that machine computers connections) was based on the system of domain name and therefore makes a complete censor difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is customizable in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (on the blocking of Wikipedia), we put it all to take snapshots of Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility of reading the content on decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the site www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was performed independently from the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia involved in other efforts to avoid the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni by Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansicyclope.org, an open source project that everyone can use to hold similar Mirror pages when locked in the country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as employees at Mozilla in Panigrahi's open Speak "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">It is accessing a different URL, which is not the original. that what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server guides the request on the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he saw around himself, never satisfied. they were blurred with poorly positionable motives and full colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry him a camera and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar devoted himself to the international scene.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home village right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that lacks attention to Nepalese wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook as this first-class situation in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could be better for a passionate game photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was wondering at home when he suddenly called Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river, where the leopard was found and I immediately started to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to achieve cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepalese nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he stood at face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb by the opinion of the sheep not during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately puts us down, we see you and he starred me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepals Nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of an content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women should avoid the greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even from older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronouns saying "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should violate the norm in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Oeva by a pseudo-court and from her family and the village community, after she had addressed a registered relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also does not exist in the name, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer assignments to fear if ever, they should not follow these practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health professionals and housewives, a unique club, thus became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone in which they discuss and discuss the beauties of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and settling for the mining of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas works for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices, such as child bribe up to the support of HIV- and AIDS infected, and runs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs were created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassador of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini shown in her discussion round, acted by women who do not call their husbands at name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands, not noisy, is an example that honors them all obligations and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this will be regarded as postponed as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made thoughts about this discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to try her husband so far, to try at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells you:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video had ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had heard the word "Patriarchate" never before heard. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap, Rohini displayed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women attempting to bring discussion with a exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, means that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on her lips," says Rohini Paa from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which women married the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells you:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise only kinsed, another decided to release all the frustration of frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In addition to the adrenaline round about, with an ancient breach, the women decided to actually try her husbands at home to call their husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days, Rohini received a wide variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, asking what ideas she put in the head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother in law urged them, she was afraid, and said that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini meant to do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of participating in was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as the traverse of the interest of interest in the forehead, which indicates the spestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show women that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinnoberred dot if he did it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I heard it to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not complete with that, but think that they are now in a better position to choose him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip at each review.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, she celebrated their own birth days with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never made thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">For so many years I have been working on this problems and yet I have been working on some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great, certain things to say loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we have talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne saris only since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, this is okay, but some wanted a Saleh-Kurta, a wide shirt for a trousers, they don't have dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of controversy and discussion on the benefits of your own wardrobe, morality linked to the saris and much more, smugable Rohini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa with which they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly getting into rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted a few times, but then again stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women bear in at every time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion forums know that the changes that they want to achieve in their life - like the line to navigate up more freedom of movement or its own dress code - at the end of a hard to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone the confidence that something is going to change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if each woman goes home in the club and other people about it, what we're talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in international community attention after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison because of "Subversion" (State partner), after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to record the salmon forces to China, as the exports had been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release and invited Liu to get his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to pay his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told me that Lius wife, Liu Xia, who could visit him every day, but the police always watched the room in the hospital, and that Liu is not allowed to speak with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum goes on to say:</seg>

<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished to a harmonious, more stable and wealthiest China, which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or land?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Singapore is a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly since Singapore is at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam should be considered a city as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It assists that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the minister of Justice," "" "to rotate logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country, we hear that we are no country at end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the ticket to escape from the responsibilities, a must infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The grounds were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', considering that he appeared unavoidable undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that become permanent from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the main point of the subject, the good old Leier appears on the authoritarian machinations, who pretended to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic since they fit into their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shancourgam had given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our dictative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tarried with non-answers rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls upon Shanamalgam to illustrate his opinion, because she didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, it is a city, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our werful K Shandis would take up the effort to clarify this point if he was paid up in order to be part of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog its commentary, he refers to the criticisms that you should start to read the entire transcription of the conference, so that you can understand the context of the statement by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was more of a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he stated, why the elections were so important in Singapore, even if we are free and righteous elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He died in Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was not a country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in that sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shancourgam, who as a leader of a growing generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Justice Minister said of Singapore has said very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - would I agree with them or not, but that's a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes, right, and aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review broke the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shanthroamalgam have committed a mistake or was it a while?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally countryside and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government of the government, the statements of Mr. Shandis are serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people share their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">In order to extend the magazine Journey of a Decade to confirm Singapore, it was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many Singaporean...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear" "" "the defense of the country above all" "", "but that's not quite right." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should talk about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there are few that differs us Canadians of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians will bring a Canadian flag well visible to her rucksack when they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, however,....</seg>

<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as "nice" means to be called "nice" means to be busy - as is good, gentle, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from "Die Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem exists that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless to be harmless and unobtrusive and no attention to earn.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, away from things that pass around one around.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A music video published in Thailand, which celebrated the Junta, which took power in 2014, and despite its promises to restore civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his friend to make his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video refers indirectly to the sustained military rule of the junta.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy, inparticular how it is capable of dealing with the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Have a look at these photos of the video, which relate to some of the political topics that have pursued the Thailand in the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, it is situated at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a coral pink Brillenframe and golden colour earrings in teddy bears.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather she herself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitian, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with grinding, crumble walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">There is a parrots in a cage in the anteroom.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to call it: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you on Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time this year.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medicines that they do not pay, they massage them with a balm that drew off from long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived before a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States to make it normal for the first stop in South America and move towards the North.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "mum Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel together the distance and that Africans already speak on WhatsApp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of its leader has lived Michelet before in Brazil and worked as a construction worker in construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy has been weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest since months on Mama Africa: he sells SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again," he replied smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells that their guests are often sending text messages when they are gone to greet them, or to report them over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught chicken, chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only sparking hope to travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The other end of the city leads a slackasse to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valencia and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman, and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them, having a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar's night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 people, mostly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert, and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula arrives from Central America, other residents open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to presses his money without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an all-stone, has offered it their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives, and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travellers consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother her album tells her in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair stains that you made a rin, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and elderly.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-Point for personal communication equipment in Xinjang from Twitter users to the end of the user.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users of the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile notification where it refers to the district government to install a surveillance app named Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message," "" "the app" "" "is said to have access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities must also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app shortly after they had replaced the app, messages with a private WeChat group had changed.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police informed that the app could determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists, and would follow together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic websites, of online fraud, Trojan and phishing sites to make users aware how much time they spend online, and to control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A app with these functions can naturally be used in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could manipulate state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements news about digital censorship in China mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often nosterous for those who live in remote, submerging ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often classify extreme interest and monitoring measures, as well as routinemless internet connections.</seg>
<seg id="1976">On Twitter based Media-Outlet "Images from Main Country China" (free-charge), the censored news in China published, showed photos of a checkpoint where police sent the residents indiscriminately, if they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure the people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a return for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (dammers) also released a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and therefore get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the statements of the City-party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government officials, authorities and related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office at the operation of their computer and communication equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published on June 27 in a district of regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs, until 1 August their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police register.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Intent is apparently any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible outcomes included, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2081">I decided to lay down myself again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed, which came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens up and the morning light meets the room ".Raus with you, asshficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I reply with the voice of an exhausted young people: "my lord, my Father has to worry about."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk away, you'll be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they always had released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photograph was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib is bringing the most of his time inside; sometimes he strokes to his canvas, even to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely, is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has heard them since 1967; the year that Israel was forced to complete his occupation of the West Bank and had to flee from their village in Palestine, where they had lived as felahyae (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activity that turned up to the conservative majority against gender roles, sexuality and free expression of expression through art and Rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often dispersed by topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian Refugee. all these issues can not only be found in his hometown Amman, but also in cities committed by Damascus in Syria to the whole of Sanaa.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not constrained in his thinking and may be according to people's participation, who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it does not exist openly, it sweeps a special circumstance against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who try to do in war zones, something with his identity as "Palestinian Refugeant" - so he himself was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own living circumstances," Hdaib is emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "while he shook in water, it is the holy month Ramadan; it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast to sunset from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also says that the public consumption is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for this to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sening hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slums are lukewarm coffee and the squadron of Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when you cast a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is therefore easy to avoid essential things - as in public during Ramadan water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Minister Jordanians had cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections support the Islamic State Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country, argue and the main reason for the concert is.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "in an interview with CNN, the members of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "had to be cancelled" "" "due to sexual orientation of the scary." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim also the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world, is dangerous activist, which imposes strict legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian nation as a "progressive supporters of human rights," which continues to use for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be easy to be fair rhetoric, but actually an increasingly challenging reality in Jordan, clearly reflected in the Hdaibs plant.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib made traditional norms to body, having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a manifest unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should have confidence.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, the number of 'Honorable' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outward.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch, according to its peak, the number of honors in 2016 reached its peak; however, the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women, victims of murder or domestic violence, to provide a reasonable kind.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on breaking control of the year 1954, women who are subjected to the danger of internalised violence, "and for their release, often a years-long bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music is very popular with great popularity and is known to repay even from themes in his country for long as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, dreamed that he is his music that is full of explicit accusations on sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was told politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib accepts the question of Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically at the heart can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and each other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words, "that can be what you want." be faith or not believe, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals still were censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineage program Roya to remember that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but it was only a working version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nubian, a poet from the eighth century who has remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nubian, who later should work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can't he do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemictic kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive votes are being silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teaching association with the grounds that they had expressed in social media critical to the problems associated with the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given that, the Hdaibs show is only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to act a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is an uplifting and take-out. Jordan gave Mashrou'Leila again for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - there is no slow, need and inner alterations. it is certain that these changes take place every day at the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs also dreamt, of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He has not only dreamt of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to live "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is thinking about music, art and literature a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, streumunitions and artificial type of democracies. at least he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, hdaib will continue to carry on, and consequently also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to the student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant war dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories to the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One thought that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory says that the drums, the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years were handed over, in the armies of Japan in the Northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab a couple of great seats, so we have a superb view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can imagine only how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gayoen, organised a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literal.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two fortnight cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only True and a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Sommerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18-meter high hill car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rare were external apparition and body care so important as in this history, because they help to maintain the Peruvian youth of crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser's hair.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus principal port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), has led to always more norms in the experienced hands of hairstyles that can be recreated with them.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of Friseure "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts predict each other to show who you can create the eccentric Looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found himself in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people against hair tools and instead of bad advice to get an apprenticeship in hairdresser art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the interested possibilities, dozens of young people saw that they can seize a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops in March of the school year and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district, whereon we are very proud, because of love for the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrillas</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the revised version of" "" "love messages" "" "guerrillas" "", "published the International online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important to bring yourself into affection, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went missing the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation. she inspired her to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people encouraged to write letters to their letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Just recently, their country was the place of an historic event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the FARC guerricist Movement (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be the signing of the Nobel Peace Treaty, as promised that the President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">There is a long way ahead of Colombia, until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillama, who had been living in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a war rhetoric, and around the clock carrying their weapons in themselves, now they have to integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company again, who had used itself to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply accustomed to guerrillas, must take them into their ranks, and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombia had to join together and would have to help integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former guerrillas to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The Campaign for the Campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrillas - who are then to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Peace Laureates, who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love to write on the Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those who forget it much unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told them to share his love with people this year, which needed the most urgent promises.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former warriors of the FARC. "the letters will demonstrate that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation in the camp to deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC found themselves as they had done earlier to counteract the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between," says the Manuela Jiménez Avila.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former warrior led me to the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of cabin where the guerrillas live), I saw a guerrilla fighting, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranator, a lethal weapon in the thorn nap.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I answered him, and said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I reply to a letter which someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before my life someone has written something like this, that's why I answer. "I suddenly set the tears on the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him, and sat down beside the pomegranator.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for war, was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions of this battles, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. the FARC was the only way to keep it and his six brothers in front of the famine. "I never thought that someone would be forgiven for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC met a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as a war, and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC, the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years have we experienced, as the social injustice by the State had been working on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves on a political party, we can contribute to design the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people, who had never heard the hearing and had no electoral law, and to know that the people, which I often seen as a monster, and even have learned people with beautiful feelings that were turned through their habitat and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality living in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and caused much harm, can give us a bit and a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the City Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Kolumbianists were made that, after disarmament, peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it inequality, hunger, and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be individuals who are ready to collect and protest to their rights, and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what breed, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all that dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, our contribution, and sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. among us that defend life as the foundation of existence, many difficulties are imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way, there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they grow up, it became aware that Chechnya was no safer place for them, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechnyan's gender equality, the hunt was opened to Sabrina.</seg>

<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transwife, who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he was a friend of whom I thought he would have been a friend, a copy of my documents and spread all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. so there are no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame? "</seg>

<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing just some shopping bags from the seat of my car I heard a men's voice saying: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a sentence, but this time at Chechen: "how long will you honor the family, you shout?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke last end in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had taken away everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had ventured two samples in my right lung level.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which ambulance you have been placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name. but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful to him that he was respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats of threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They cried to me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relations.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to send me to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me, I have to prove it up without the streets; others wanted me to open up in the official television in Grozy and I say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only bad things, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a rope around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened to the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends examine the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to pay their names, but I want to say that I don't remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">I left the country with her help, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought her, without registration without notice, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived at and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plug the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you warmest in safety, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know you know in which hotel you're on. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That really was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality. however, this is a table theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasus elements I still bear in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very much I would like to overcome this soul barrier I can't overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatting with camera, I give myself effort to see how the person reminds you of her past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had eaten a half month in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan had not been arrested and tortured, but also that all the Ramadan Ramadan could wait to wait, and he didn't lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Thus, mine, they probably invite the relatives, these are the problem with the affected people and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: even now gay men are held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it wasn't very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all those who have no rich relatives or that were dropped from their relatives to put the Kadyrows court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so you can present them later than terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim that they had attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply gone, they are targeted to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only an assumption or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Argun for a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have gone in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was involved as those people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not introduced as a bandits, so far, there were no reports yet. we assume that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would one shouldn't have this man allowed to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, had already been found in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already known in Grozny before 2003 when I still lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia was originally intended to lead us to the "Civilization" but finally cast us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were hatched; I had coloured eyelashes, wore a tube and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety ministry of the Scharia has never made me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like mine hit.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrasing: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "donot not on the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children, when they are doing so funny about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so just shut their eyes from you because they believed you are ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted, and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did it work?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on TV on morals.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us, but foremost to the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could sense how the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had laughed and laughed before, contemplating yourself with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation existed in the republic steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go to work now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waiter.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I have communere with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize tea, merging, I invite you to the hospital, helping them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself, when I cut off random variety.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you contribute to Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So, nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That's exactly the same as Chechnyan, who want you to do with foam in front of the mouth that there are no coils.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan who have the Cabardiners who have the Russians also have; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I am from there, so it is very pleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practiced Muslims, go into the mosque and fast in the Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about Transiidentity of men who love men, and they believe that you are changing his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a trusty.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact, different living adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not very sad at all - I just know I'm now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn an increase of self-morale within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi Community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there is a strong increase of self-morals.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27th came the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi Community in Iran, which is characterised by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed for his own assistance to stay inability for his family, so Ahwazi Human Rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">On YouTube, a video stopped the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people manage to delete the flames again, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The local sources, according to the local sources, were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which had happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists in front of the spot that more men might take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - has hung.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: these were all family ancestors, who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families and pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arabic Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where most of the Arab ancestor-Nazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to dispute its living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in the oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most experienced and valuable useful areas for Iranian farming.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continue to be slow, and the local population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and emptiness.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied involvement in the Ahwazi-Arabs systematically workplaces in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a wide variety of tribes, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian Gulf, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to destroy the devastation caused by dryness, and destroying local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate under the Arab Aciale-young people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian-General Director for Cooperation, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis completed a job that completed primary school, 55% completed a secondary school and completed a degree of 45%.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy..." aimed at destroy the spirit of national resistance "</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestral and human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," to a "high rise" of the number of self-moral among young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment has become worse since. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arabic discrimination in the integration process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefers Arabian workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aimed to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their lives outside their homeland.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their ancestor and surname to hide their belonging to Ahwazi, as even Arab names are not tolerated in the workplace, softer than speaking of Arabic language or the carrying out of Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must bear, human rights activists alarm, before the situation is explosives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, whether the world is wake up and knowledge.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was the object of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, so many women - especially white women who designate himself as an intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well through scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all Feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money in spite of the same education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation, if it is about what they are able to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still taking care of making women sooner or later in various sectors of life on a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender are still ongoing across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is conscious of me and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak of skin color, on racism, black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the diaspora; if I do not mention, as we have always been misused under rattling and discrimination; as well as outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they are all united that women - all women should come together to lift their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord', to get the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutional form of racist motivated violence that we are subject to black women.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spears and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On one hand, I want all women, all men and all men each have any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can't connect myself as a black woman to take into account the white woman who refuses to take refuge in their thinking, which refers to both the sex as well as to the skin color of one person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and won't fight over my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spies that always rejected me and countless other black women and again rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, sojourner complained in their speech: "am I not a woman?" and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised nature.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, to drive their egocentrist program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to define white women the importance of irritation of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revive them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to borrow women in different ways and bordered from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to dissolve myself fully and completely eradicate against feminism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever, that we define black women to our own ideas and give us into the Spare, which will be created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves), in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling, having read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement from which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognised because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither overtaken, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effects of pollution in his community.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article is part of the series # PorserMujer (# softer) that relates over the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">Ada Báez said that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become a non-violent man.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of its relationship a little time has passed and the police said, their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena showed nothing for abuse, the accomplient display of Ada Báez did not profit.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved back her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women are ever able to report, they generally don't receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse it. this also explains why only 20% of women who admit to be victims of violence at all in law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 Punishment and Statistical 2 Invisible Misabuse and a Legal System, which is not subject to nothing worse laws: good approach, lack of implementation, and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really harassed, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, at the district Attorney, 9600 ads were arrested for domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads were killed by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peacekeeping force. 86% of women came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, this statistics do not show the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen female minister Ana Baiardi only few of these crimes are also shown. "on any woman who are refunded in Paraguay because of mental abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "every woman who are refunded for physical abuse will be refunded, two women who do not do this," "" "stated at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is not their own criminal offences, law enforcement agencies can not be adequately documented, as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone there were at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence caused by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the solid friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning, it didn't want to do that, but then, however, it was to be regretted for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and nothing more with Carlos. but for two years she wore the psychic violence against women, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would have a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it before, I always thought that that only women happens to be submised because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, they wrote posts on Facebook where they described his insults and several attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, among them Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, whether he had ever raised the hand against her and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users ask Mariana, why they had fallen so long by Carlos and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mistreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te CREO network, which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias Fall, everything began with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their wealthy partner even managed to convince her, to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads in the authorities remained without a result and even from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a process against her former partner who developed into an inwardly judicial struggle between Paraguay and her homeland, in which it mainly went to money, power and influence of her former Partners.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also provides great problems in the application of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# Principal).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Unless) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law sees the Femizid draft to explain and harden harder as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislations in some point was altered to win even the MPs to win the law, who feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently forbidden in Paraguay, and will be punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to cost the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which have to carry the victims of violence at present, if they just want to report and receive a safe place to raise up the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for this purpose:</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law passed in paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been altered. among other things, one passage was canceled against the partners in cases of domestic violence towards reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than one year ago the oman authorities signed an independent Arabic newspaper Azamn because of their reporting on corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to prison, where he served a year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried to trial later.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had placed his father, Said ibn Taimur.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Defence, Minister of Ministers, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's dominion is characterized by the labour force of security forces, especially the domestic intelligence service, the public freedom, including freedom of freedom, limit and human rights, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, intimidate and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities protect peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hinder citizens, also activists, in order to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and closing three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) since its foundation in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor-in-Chief of Azamn, published an article entitled "High-ranking parties to the hands of justice." it went to corruption in the Judiciary and the interference of high-level officials in judicial decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both sentenced under other things because of the public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "underexcavation of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of injury of a public ban and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and fines in the amount of 3,000 omic rial (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year vocational ban on the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars), following the use of "a information network to spread the material that could pose a danger for public order."</seg>

<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also adopted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the court to regain Azamn, the newspaper looks after attacks by the oman government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On January 8, the Information Minister received a statement which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and putting the Minister for another time against the decision of the Appeal Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The constant closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the Press freedom was injured in Oman.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For further injuries, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercising of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to make its operation.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture will be done with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area, which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need of local medical research, there are two reasons: there are many medicines and vaccines, which cover the special medical demand on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread impact than elsewhere, and lack of investment for exploring these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research that is carried out by African scientists in Africa can be used in establishing its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the central control centre in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">When postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania he insisted on the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and on misunderstanding the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I supported the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also rigid a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB, and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we use only solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay recipient, instead of being movers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get, are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable researchers for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or come back here, because funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interesting, but only a very limited scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need for special academic education starting in any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, exploration of space, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the basic access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited to the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky appeared originally on the Ensia.com website, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been brewed in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company provides 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant produced by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work has been placed only by his own downfall and the question, how many salesars can get, limits limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more of such patents have been registered to more plants such as cereals or cartottensity. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmental protective and expert for food security provide the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still a salad, but he still needs longer, since its work is always worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like being a rock broil in a river, around which I have to paddle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it is a breach with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand before court, no one can breed more than new salesals because all features are already patented. "it thus makes as good as possible and tries to recover those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and endeavouring to use any material being protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It is also connected to a movement that is becoming increasingly bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">The astronaut of the International Space Station ISS have bred red comersalat the variety Outreddish in the "greenhouse" of the station and ate. there is being tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like that, as the movement from the IT field would come and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that offers alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and properties are not protected as intellectual property, and so for plant-breeders are useful.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders may also commit that others may use them desperate seed freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders allow only others who want to breed their seed, to breed so own sorts - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patente.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerized Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed is giving him a role in major interaction such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter, not or only little by using seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasizes that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement is not busy with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "for example, we want to buy control over the seeds," he says and takes care of the process of environmental sustainability, such as for example on farms markets, should also know the way that this vegetables is bred, threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereign wealth without seeds is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to make other their seed freely available. so, in contrast, it stands to patented seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi Supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, because the natural pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is always restricted to restricted, unbreakable.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, has been engaged in her thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the card features are protected as intellectual property, making it either used for plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are still no such estimates, but experts like Luby suggests that massaging plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Viswise</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants become so strong that they feature targeted features - of such, through which their taste or their color improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Adversaries of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders decreases by more patents. genetic diversity is currently unnecessary as ever before, as the changing conditions are unpredictable due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto's spokeswoman Carly Scaduto recognise that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos's activities. with a total of four Genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States, the company set itself the preservation of the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it does not contradict that intellectual property preserves other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of Plant variets innovations." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection is so uninhibited innovation, but promotes it to be provided by public more materials and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait until a patent was christened, they certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources are always a general good. it also should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetaries are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interferes with the concept of itself to patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the characteristics itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They originate from themselves and, as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "anyone breaching a variety, also curb its own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, in which cultivation of herbicides are needed, breeding in its varieties of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just gentleman. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some moderate-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they can also survive the most smaller seed companies, either reject it or hold it for too expensive and therefore do not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in its breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders is innovative by avoiding plant patrons: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a couple of years ago, "he says." with a patent, one has been protected for 20 years before the competition, making it easy for my opinion. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seem to be a leader in the open source "breeding, the concept is now spreading throughout the world quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as professional organization in the area of resources, an "open-source" seed program works with farmers together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization co-col works on an "open-source" license which ultimately has a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding themselves differ from land to country, essential for Ossi obligation not simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally farmed plants should not be patented. thus, it talks to the present practice of the European Patent Office, the patents are permitted to conventionally farmed plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not a law; now it is to the governments of Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to experience something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards the godentation of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "Open Source" seed systems explains that the organization currently has a worldwide alliance for "open source" seed systems, which is scheduled for the scheduled next year of the official start date.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, International Nonreturn Development aid) USC Canada and the Action Group to erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversität in order to publish a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - published a report. therein, they represent the possibility to exchange seed and improve seed policy, so that a stable supply can be ensured with food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection, by the Luby Ossi hopes that it will soon become more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological foods are particularly respected, where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "" "so Luby." "" "we are trying to clear the human that even more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still unlock the content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the "Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights abuses in Egypt as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities have sharply criticized and promised to continue their work and effort for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The whole Network for Human Rights Information warns: despite this attack and the mocking of the Egyptian law and the constitution to defend their goal, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities will be exhausted to overcome the blocking, and not admit. we hope to continue our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked the independent news page Mada Masr, arabic-language issue of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network in Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of website bullocks. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZMOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no access to the blog of Kolumnists and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the spread of columnist and articles he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, whom he set up in order to bypass the Zensurapparatus of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which Ziadas blog is located, on the other hand, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video, as the police executed physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article mainly focuses on politics and human rights conditions in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada said to the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">That, blogs to lock is very old, but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningless for the world, it is, however, for two reasons it is for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to convey the feeling of a siege artillery; An arrest, a attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, blocking blogs, and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to avoid censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave are the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) closed Egyptian authorities from 24th May to 06. August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on the network of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers, through the conversion of internet censorship and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we saw how the locking of Web sites that VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention to block the government to block content and filters to allow access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will also contaminert that the decisions are made behind closed doors, so the Egyptian population has no legal basis, so that they can proceed in court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The people are fighting.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day reports newspapers in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard designs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these lines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-old-old shot in school," "Every second day is a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Diebe's pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Marine and Air Force to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">Violence in Rio in the middle of the economic crisis, in the middle of the economic crisis, reached the highest level since 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice has even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So for the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio newspaper "Extra" on August 16 the Editorial "This is not normal," in which it announced, a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city will now be published.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for her decision declared the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world such as murder, robbery, sexual disorder, etc. everything, however, will be published by the civilized standard and what only happened in Rio will be called "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to make known as journalists not our eyes from the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes stated that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ruin in a country that doesn't know the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 countries, which are governed by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial the newspaper writes further:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used, atrocities of the police that only shoot and then asks questions to disguise.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption during the police, whose target is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argued to designate the violence as a "war." this is the opinion of a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to provide responsibility for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and an historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the Rio de Janeiro state is greater than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. published with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">"" "according to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" "" "22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most recent data available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">When we look at the murder rate per state, Rio is at No. 16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">The company Globo, the largest media company of South America, is one of the largest media companies in South America, which, like Cecília, has repeatedly stressed the policy of security policy since years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Among these security policy measures the foundation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one from the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to conquer a Favela police station and stationed a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this resulted in a decrease of nonviolent death. however, after several years the UPP was supposed to protect the newly created police unit, which should protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under fire.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page he cited the journalist João Paulo Charleaux from one of his article published in 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio are not defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the designation "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio will also have serious consequences for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls on the state to use resources and ways that are typical for war. to this end, penetration into the territory of a "enemy" is an unsharp point in the landscape and the object for "collateral damage" and "distorted balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War, or her, Fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continues to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police invoked the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho, to avenge the death of a police officer.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all of these violence, this incident happened: a fruit mischier died as a consequence of shots, which fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the PAX and the Research Institute, The Syria Institute, are in Damascus and surrounding areas of Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib, currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly strong, where an attack on chemical weapons resulted in hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition, are based on the basis of the investigation of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebels, controlled by rebels, have stood under siege outside Damascus, leading to that people to rely on locally, or by tunnels and inspection points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">By the years long blockade, traditional food stuffs like meat has become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>

<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnear and lead the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the common, planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, its nutritional value, however, makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, subscription Nabil, said opposite the French news agency AFP:</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that took part in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two-two people died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to that the government proclaimed the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, in Pedrógão Grande, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, which caused 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry system, which monitors the forest surfaces by satellite photos, in 2017 alone some 500,000 acres of forest are burned - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 boroughs.</seg>

<seg id="2851">Furthermore, construction permits in oil markets with high fire risk are demanded.</seg>
<seg id="2852">An extensive suggestion to the forest form, which brought the government according to serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005, was objectionable by municipalities which saw the new rules as obstacle for investment.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible war erupted between the various mujahedin groups, which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair.</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara, leaving the country in direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ahaaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coachwork. the work was heavy and made it ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left from its low wage, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and sluggish bags with mortar that were harder than he himself to make his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran is characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, which we worked as well.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open window, so we do not froze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ahaaf left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Ahaaf homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church that divided twice a day of food in needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seekers. however, it is true, however, that the conditions that the asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special admission centers" in the hands of improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording center, if it officially filed an application for asylum - which can withdraw for months after the registration of asylum.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf as well.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbearers of life helped Ahaaf soon coming from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of work in construction industry, Asharaf put his total savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that he opened a second hostel after a while.</seg>

<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, 20.000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of Afghans developed businesses, including cutting places, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiter and the kitchen staff mostly made refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
