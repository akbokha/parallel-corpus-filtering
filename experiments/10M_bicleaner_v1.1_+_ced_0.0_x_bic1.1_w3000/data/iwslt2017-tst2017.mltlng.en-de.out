this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times reporter .
long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA had illeg@@ ally owned by Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service operation in which the CIA over@@ threw his designs for nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter wasn &apos;t pleased ?
the US government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has identified R@@ isen for almost 10 years and sum@@ mon@@ ed him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became the symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and sp@@ ying journalists .
according to the First Con@@ stitu@@ ent media , media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media don &apos;t get these information and if they cannot protect the identity of the patterns they give .
so when the government was ank@@ eted on R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous repor@@ ters already did before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go to prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something exceptional happened .
suddenly , although it would have been essential for years that it would be essential for their fall , the government &apos;s demands were dropped .
the reason : in time electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and springs can always hide themselves less .
rather than to fail and rape to make statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so investig@@ ators , without his consent , would be worried by telephone ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , credit cards , and even travel references with the list of his flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA bo@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ky source , to condemn .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , Justice has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as secret .
almost every article on national security has been the result since September 11 that a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower fell to a journalist .
thus , we use the game work on the game that will be protected by the first constitutional complaints , because the government has more opportunities to accept all .
but just as technology of the government allows to avoid the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can take this from the moment in which they contact , instead of lying , in the witness .
today , there are communication software that has not yet been written than R@@ isen had written his book , and it is considerably more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transfer system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet tradition , which was developed by us by Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been developed .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server where the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot provide more information hidden , and many of the information they would like would not be available from the out@@ set .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments develop new spy technologies that are all dangerous to us .
it is certain to ensure that not only technology components such as Edward Snow@@ den have one way to bring ini@@ quities . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
the ab@@ norm@@ alities at the supply of soldiers should know and report of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm for the contaminated water of F@@ lint . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider that warns us prior to the financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rei@@ che and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous amount of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to form a statement . &#93; this week , we were asked by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama @-@ based Bar Association Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small gli@@ mp@@ se into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you judge this ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works , as it works .
this has already led to its first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister came back .
also , there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al @-@ Assad has admitted to control companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there &apos;s a lot of rich people and others , who are nervous about the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of a agency or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems , cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful in the location are to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few , to hide their assets and to kill -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years .
I think many people will seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is difficult to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine like a Mat@@ ry@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US .
probably because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revel@@ ations , this scandal .
now , it is not so that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states , less information needs to give less information to found a company than to get a library code .
this kind of in@@ action in the US has allowed employees of school@@ children to be drawn from school children .
it has allowed che@@ aters to off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent an investig@@ ator investig@@ ators in the offices of 13 legal firms in Manhattan .
investig@@ ators gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring the susp@@ icious money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that everyone could make suggestions to our investig@@ ator , as he could transfer his money .
these were all pre @-@ preaching . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , who comm@@ its investig@@ ator &apos;s investig@@ ators .
it &apos;s not about a single leading pole , implic@@ ated in a scandal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to tackle this , we have to change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound very much sen@@ sel@@ ess than if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I really see that a lot has to change .
in the past few years , we saw advantages to greater transparency , affecting the owners of companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the EU has recorded at national level regi@@ sters on national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is behind .
representatives of both parties have entered a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians but this does not do the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure in the US and globally for greater transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are mad if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that arise and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ clear is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recogni@@ zes the problem and use themselves by laws this kind of in@@ action .
together , we can finally finish the in@@ transparency , which now still makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I have been ab@@ duc@@ ted almost and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I had completed my design studies , I made an am@@ ho@@ ist .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he delighted to tell me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land off the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , like please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was then in bed , I waited for the ceiling , and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken up ?
a wild man sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sw@@ am ti@@ dy at the door , and shut up my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he had bought from me is today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view@@ angle completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood , actually friends who were waiting only waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air@@ mat@@ ur@@ age was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took air mat@@ s .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ate draws and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there were a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new fellow occup@@ ier Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think we could earn something . our apartment will stay in a designer bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on wooden floors for 20 dollars .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and fell the door into the castle , Brian and I was waiting for us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time , and pay our rent again ?
things came into rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
so we presented ourselves the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on the people public pictures of their private homes , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , their doors one closes when visitors come over .
on the Internet , they can invite their wild people to stay with them .
that will become the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket would burn .
but they do not act .
nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a shop that allows children to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because , as children have all learned , strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you can contempl@@ ate the things that you can good . we could design@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design@@ ate objects now , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never had met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create with confidence ?
I want to give you a taste , which temperatures we aim .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone for your left seat .
this quiet inc@@ iner@@ ary of panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they opening the door for the first time .
for the only thing , what more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell of a foreig@@ ner in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
just like that , who actually has Al Go@@ res mobile ?
could you tell Twitter that he can@@ di@@ eth for the office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor was first introduced only once with his name , if he had told how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 ass@@ essments , all say : &quot; he can really hold off the mobile phones very well ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well @-@ done feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to leave negative ass@@ essments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest were submitted before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined , how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are similar to age and residence .
little surprising , we trust the people most , who are similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social default .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
if one has less than three convic@@ tions , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation sti@@ cky simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
moreover , we knew that confidence is dependent on how much they are .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
when you say too little , for example &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
telling me too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted as well .
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; Great artwork in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design , to create this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which issues you should write something .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dis@@ close these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us the business is running very well .
of course , there are times if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who are not allowed to celebrate parties or homes .
the host have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front , when faith was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts , if I just think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the lawyer , and will also be our greatest motivation to improve us .
fortunately , a fraction of 123 million nights only had a fraction .
for people trusted in each other .
if confidence is working , there may arise wonder .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host ran to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to heart attacks .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real protection class that save one life , even though they don &apos;t know right .
you drive one in your own car into the hospital , when you dies , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they get books by .
they can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , it doesn &apos;t run any stay .
but these relations behind the pure cash transactions are just what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled across the term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of part with money transactions fit together ?
it is here about an economic trade .
but it &apos;s just simply the &quot; rental industry &quot; to call it , the thing is not just right .
Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships .
people put a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare it to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would be , if travelling a generous buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group there would be interested in a group there , to fill a thor@@ ough and one at a bar ben@@ ches district , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could cook from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to privacy .
what would be , if we would create flats of reason for sharing together ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have taken the idea of a common part ?
I imagine cities that allow us company and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and amor@@ tis@@ ation .
this project has already begun in South Korean capital , Seoul , many places that belonged to the government ,
now an@@ dwell@@ ers were offered . students who were looking for a stay , were offered ,
were medi@@ ated to people , whose children were moved out . they were incub@@ ated by In@@ cub@@ ator ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . today , over our platform , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries are being hosted by a foreig@@ ner or himself host .
so the idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why has just worked out ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the interests of confidence .
design can help us overcome a profound pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it , if a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
of course , we know that design can &apos;t solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use Design soon .
thanks .
what do you think when you see me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , a brain la@@ undering , a terror player ?
or simply a delay at the airport at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so , people represent the media , which look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know any Muslims .
probably the people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber riders .
for those who have never learned to know a Muslims : it &apos;s great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ al@@ ant fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to decide that .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ te me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to wear Hi@@ j@@ ab my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you supp@@ ressed yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , as opposed to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to suit me a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have added with the Koran .
I read it , thought after , asked in question , doub@@ ted , and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dev@@ otion to deep@@ en with any reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to weeping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever have the feeling that someone you perceive , you fully understands and yet somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began as all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in essence the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then that horri@@ ble morning was in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , gaz@@ ed at the end , looked upon the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jum@@ ped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical dis@@ ruption ?
my shock turned himself rapidly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do such a thing ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u transformed the deeds of others from a citizen into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to go through the Middle West in the US to move into a new city and start building studies .
I remember how to keep quiet -- as we keep silent -- so deeply it went into my seat , and I was afraid for the first time to be known as Muslim .
we moved in this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard , and I read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in well @-@ lit areas &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gathered to prayer .
and back the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who kept for Muslims in the open , and struck them .
there really was fire on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something was not feeling right .
because people who attacked this land , have attacked our country .
I have turned the rage of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people saying : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it &apos;s called Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and Mos@@ ques .
they talk of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumor was removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all the other Americans , no tum@@ ors in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , salvation , and Olympic risks .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to toler@@ ate people from other faith , and show greater citizens .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
during the radio process , one has found that he begins online . as a first person , the person is cut off from their community , so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists may be the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to stop people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group of the IS justified their brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would add to us in their imag@@ inations , if they recognise them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but when one thro@@ ws a look at them , they do not drive what they l@@ ases in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which they can read these things in writing .
an excellent I@@ mam recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because she is the high@@ ways to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she had spoken , brought them to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense for in@@ justice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that had given their anger to anger , it was a major goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation of extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke to their solution .
this I@@ mam set the connection to God and her church .
rather than acc@@ use them for their anger , he demonstrated their construc@@ tive ways for a real change in the world .
what it learned at the mosque , she kept it to join the IS .
this was an insight like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- indicate : if we fear ourselves , at least three things pass .
we will rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : when one reports trial news , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they agree more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of the American Muslims .
this is not only an academic issue .
if you look when the mood against Muslims were shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the lead of the war , and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to a Muslim terror , as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to mani@@ pulation the public to caves the foundations of a free society , the reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts to us all .
in terms of collective guilt , it is not only about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the dental Faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous people , whom they knew .
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was intri@@ gu@@ ed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did my father become such a sealed young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne with her brother and his wife , she murdered her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , which was in the afternoon . he did in her apartment , as with an execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ atism can not only be mor@@ ally , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it was because of the America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one that we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
we drove in silence with our son in the children &apos;s seat , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , and drew up my shoes , and went into the building hall , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the I@@ mam made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , for the half of the assem@@ blies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us .
in that moment , I am collapsed .
these people were there because they had compassion and compassion , and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ smus ?
are you going to go on safe ?
or are you connected to those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what to say that you say that you &apos;re holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk to work a memorial with deep , in a noble memorial factory , so an exception and not the rule is .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did so with the greatest of the study carried out to Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am an exception in all respects .
if people like an exception to rule , then usually the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ler , stands shortly before , to become a billi@@ on@@ aire shop .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ink@@ ers . it is possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air par@@ cel to our social consciousness , autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower in France for a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower in France . some years ago they began to fly with healing .
by connecting passengers reach high speed and acceleration on tight space .
you can also build autonomous structures , too .
they have learned to carry loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence , and in general to react to natural laws .
today , we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to sur@@ pass the borders of the possibility in autonomous flight .
so that a system autonomous works , it must know collec@@ tively , where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new location technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our lab@@ s .
there are no external cameras .
each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculated calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a plane , trying to beat two flies with a folder .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most of the star@@ ters , it can ho@@ ver , and thus large benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping page .
a lim@@ iter of hed@@ ge@@ sti@@ cker is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind b@@ ö@@ es .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t care in what position can be improved to the optimal position and improves performance by practice .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract issues , which turn to the core of the matter .
one such question would be , for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known for around as machines with a thousand moving parts that accum@@ ulate to viol@@ ate you .
decades ago , trained pilots couldn &apos;t fly tra@@ ilers , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ der .
un@@ long we discovered that flies only works with one .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest air device . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further actu@@ ators or controllers , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much , so it can fly stable , and moving in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it right away if all look , is low , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in in@@ geni@@ ous , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , one exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is just symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambitious in its alignment .
thereby he receives the outstanding capacity ,
to move in space to all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the fields of interactive rivers of the eight is@@ ot@@ ers .
some is mentioned in models , the rest being lear@@ ns directly at flying .
let &apos;s see it at all .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this revol@@ ves in clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ru@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can the machine fly further , if restricted .
we will demonstrate this now , making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration was examined synthetic swar@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with local technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine above Broadway wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us the wages in the development and the rh@@ age act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that creative , wise creatures allow it to form a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economical potential , the dot is on the i .
thank you very much .
a very far distant galaxy approximately 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galaxy , two black holes are always qu@@ icker , they turned the mixture three times in a t@@ enth@@ s of pure energy .
for this short moment they lighten@@ ed brigh@@ ter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big pop .
but they put their energy in the form of light --
finally , we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure themselves and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we first order the events in time .
just 1.3 billion years ago , just multi @-@ cell lives had emerged on earth .
since then , Earth has caused a lot to produce : cor@@ als , fish , plants , dinosau@@ rs , people and -- God stand up -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the C@@ alt@@ ech -- have a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational shells caused by col@@ li@@ zing black holes .
most held them for crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy genius so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ m Observ@@ atory Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o could significantly increase what the detection performance improved enor@@ m@@ ously .
therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the operation of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ant black holes throughout the earth through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector itself .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my to@@ d@@ ill father .
basically these were the fruits of my life &apos;s life .
all this , what I had worked for is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studied gra@@ vit@@ ation waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories , such as Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ ros@@ ary of space and time .
during the passing of the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched into a direction and into the other .
to illustr@@ ate lec@@ turers in courses for rel@@ ativity , often a correctly al@@ ber@@ ing dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ cks , stretching and du@@ st@@ ling . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ation waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and gest@@ ed by the hit of the waves . the strain of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1st year , the Lig@@ o staff declared for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of a nuclear program . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves in the way : &quot; the technical difficulties in construction of such det@@ ectors are huge .
but physi@@ cists are sin@@ c@@ lically and with the support of the public , all barriers will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott argued that Lig@@ o was more than an eye than one eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite convenient . because so you can make a picture or a map of things that you can perceive from several points coming light around you .
in the tones this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean you very much :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , to close behind the story behind .
&quot; now , Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ost Bob . &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make any simple pictures of objects in all .
but by doing changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , the frequencies are measured in the audi@@ ble area at least .
so , if we convert wave pattern to sound , we can hear the all literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been busy very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ ates simply : w@@ up@@ p !
rotate the two body very quickly , you hear the same circle with an additional sound change . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u
it is a sort of movement @-@ ch@@ asing , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- Hear@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Some@@ one who knows what he must hear , recognize this as a noise from -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun@@ mass , which rotate as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 sun@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 probe , revol@@ ve for a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as never before was possible .
on this way , we can listen to all and hear the invisible .
much in all we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not see .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why living stars in super @-@ nov@@ as explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we learned about all of them .
but the exciting physical approach occurred in the core that lies behind thousands kilometres of iron , carbon , and silicon hidden .
we will never see , since these op@@ press@@ ors are .
gra@@ vit@@ ation waves through iron , as if it would like transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them because the urine is covered by its own indul@@ g@@ lowing .
by gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we &apos;ve never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we are only discovering that we listen .
in fact , Lig@@ o was right in the first ascent of things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o Project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o they are observed , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are known as the sour cherries for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o makes us a completely different perspective on events in all , in the emergence of the stars , and ultimately , as we proce@@ eded out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as brave as only possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build magnificent det@@ ectors and no@@ ises the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now the time is great dreams .
have a dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago , I tried a experiment .
one year I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of that I was afraid .
whether it made me nervous , brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I like to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
would I start playing with the spectacle ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , when I was afraid , frigh@@ tened my fear .
my fear , keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Ye@@ ah that changed my life to an unexpected . it all began with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , called all &quot; sh@@ itt@@ ens , &quot;
she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ stick . &quot;
she asked them once I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Ye@@ ah was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from then on , I swear to play with them , as soon as you can do with them . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- each single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am eager to try .
it has a magic effect on me , on my kids , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently , I really understood that &quot; yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think of things , do you revi@@ ve for life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create television . I make television .
I have television , in large style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for delivering 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every show offers hundreds of jobs that do not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days , four TV programs , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes , which are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 episodes : episodes To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series will run one another on Thursday night .
around the world , my series of 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans on bon@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that will burn around the world .
do you know who is doing this yet ?
nobody , so I am a titanium .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I tell it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work as hard as you can , if you talk a company , a country or a class@@ room , to take me seriously , and it is true if I say : I understand that there is no dream about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything sweat - no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m g@@ rie@@ ve into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it is , when I set up troops , I painted a screen .
so as you dreamed a high clay , I delivered a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and maternal , clinical and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when working is good .
a sum@@ s start in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s hear , as an animated road , I could go for ever .
many people assume , when I tell them the sum@@ s that I would speak to my writing that writing is prepared to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with TV production , when I started working and work , build , create and collabor@@ ating , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
sw@@ um is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t stri@@ ve different to size .
the feeling , not otherwise to stri@@ ve to stri@@ ve for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic to be .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only say to you , I am a titanium , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask .
in order to clear one thing : the more successful I get , the more episodes , the more over@@ coming borders , the more fun there are , the more things the same time , the more ob@@ serves me , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the mar@@ es , the sw@@ men , the sw@@ men , the sw@@ men .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ taken , exagger@@ ated , burned .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth , that their mom is one single employee .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Don &apos;t want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
there are children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I don &apos;t loved my job anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 @-@ hour days , a weekly weekend , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeping is not available , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me it was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was I .
so , what do you do when what is doing , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
I know some might think : &quot; Heu@@ l you out , the author of Titan . &quot;
but you know , you do it , you do , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , one painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that &apos;s what sum@@ s feel when sum@@ s stops when the sum@@ s stops , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart stop , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Southern States &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poses a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will say no , I will be aware of two things :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
they call no more &quot; hat@@ s . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan bin and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes in my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special .
we play and their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of the sum , I cannot do anything but to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the screen , the high sound - they do not exist anymore .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender , wat@@ cht@@ ower and the song in which it goes wrong , or whatever the girl get into &quot; Die Eis@@ queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can &apos;t believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy cher@@ ub arrives in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something we forgot .
the sum@@ s , the working season , the Titan@@ ens@@ um , is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself , using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how working my brain is , I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no power and it is not labor specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the power , which comes from the lust of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which is to be done , expectation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
once my child will play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free me as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any debt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
if you don &apos;t play ans@@ at@@ as , how do you work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at home as home .
this admission is painful , because what a man does rather work than to be home ?
well yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them is .
we are flying around in the garden , and back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst out soap bubbles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always att@@ acker to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play , until I wonder : why have we stopped playing with playing ?
you can do it too ! let them say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a meeting .
there you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they want to make something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ ton or bis@@ cuit replaced me .
and my te@@ ens daughter speak with me for 15 minutes , I am Mother of the Year .
there are only 15 minutes , more need of it .
each can get 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes on a piece !
no cell phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , children have to be done .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my chari@@ ties , my world . it does not have to be the children . it applies to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m g@@ ging and I victories . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was playing a Titan in the training when I wanted to show myself more and more .
15 minutes at a track , why not rest for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
work does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens up , and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown tune , they met me and my soul . I am guiding me on new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my job again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... not anymore .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
that is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is mine that I am a titanium . I have never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to more games .
and yet , I have everything in handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires still burn .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country , which I create , the marathon , I run , the troops , the linen walls , the sw@@ men , the sw@@ men , the sw@@ men , the sw@@ men , the mar@@ gins of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel like this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think of things I &apos;ve got up for life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a bit toler@@ at@@ y .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very nice .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very low ability to self support healing .
after serious bre@@ aches of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability .
this is the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor , trying to improve nerve functions by various surgical actions .
safely , they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; deep @-@ hir@@ n@@ stimul@@ ation . &quot; thereby you im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered heavy trem@@ or and severe pain .
however , neu@@ uro @-@ healing does not mean ne@@ uro cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to that .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was conducting a Consult@@ ant and worked day and night in the staff .
often , I ordered patients with sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ trau@@ mas @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a will sh@@ ines the brain and is incl@@ ined to the cran@@ ial pressure .
in order to save life , one must decrease the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a portion of s@@ wollen cereb@@ ral mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen c@@ ort@@ ment , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
cells from a tissue can grow , comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve them .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean François created it .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you know from the bi@@ ology class that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they divided slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cellular population , which looked like stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide a brain running brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of brain , since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injury .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear , however , of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source , which allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells are exactly so cultivated as it did Jean François Hollande
and they are then far@@ med to mark them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the removal of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ plant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ plant the same cells into woven brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkey .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after some weeks , they were taken over again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we made an injury and im@@ planted just the same cells , and now the cells remained - they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in the culture .
we could not stop here .
does these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take feed pellets for one tablet .
they made it very good .
as they achieved a stable skill level , we ended in mot@@ orized Cort@@ ex .
as a result , the ap@@ es were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen at humans , it recovered spontane@@ ously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with plastic mechanisms . they recover at certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left , they see the ap@@ es , who recovered spontane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial power from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after stimul@@ ation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
since that time we found very much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later use .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant it when people im@@ planted too .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can take this . &quot;
I definitely want .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kind of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look further into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and evaluate it , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is certain , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake , as of course , to consider .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant they are in reality , but as the inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable things .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have clearly proved that it is possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy is van@@ ished with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- became clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not influence austerity measures that were realized in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , which would say to me that democracy would be abolished if she would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economical model for real democracy .
I beg you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group to have a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ensive democracy .
without democracy our societies are m@@ owed , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
regarding waste , I would like to refer to an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently threatened with our corporations .
I call it the &quot; twin peaks @-@ parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but few recognize his dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the ver@@ itable austerity and corporations , which could be too ti@@ mid to invest there where it could produce productive and in@@ comes with which one could produce the debt mountain and could also produce all the things that humanity need ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States , in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial facilities , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , gas , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds like a lot of money until it was compar@@ ing to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do except the stock ex@@ changes and real estate prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ old in the United States , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and therefore a low total economic demand that could not invest in which they could not invest . just like O@@ di@@ pus Father , who could kill him , that his son would kill him when he is grown up ,
un@@ inten@@ tionally , the circumstances bring about the circumstances that the oil will kill him .
this is my ha@@ dern with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely emb@@ ell@@ ant art should be used to develop our lives , develop human talents , and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial for salvation of the Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the company &apos;s form to control the free and poor as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally conclu@@ des too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to imp@@ ose the job value of ath@@ etic democracy due to these statements .
the decision at the ath@@ etic democracy was and is that she was involved in the working arms , and not only the right to free expression of expression , but more important and crucial that she gave them the right to political participation with the same bal@@ ances in questions of heads of state .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not have long been held --
like a candle that lights very bright , it is burned quickly .
however , our roots democra@@ cies have not their roots in antique Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ etic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling democracy .
for the liberal democracy did not begin when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible , and the democratic process was im@@ ited to politics during the economy -- so the world of the corporations -- a democra@@ tically @-@ democratic zone .
in our today &apos;s democra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ able struggle between the two where the economy gradually subsi@@ ded and deci@@ du@@ ed them .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are no longer like before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is because you can be in the government nowadays , and yet not in power because the power of politics are mig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separate .
I mentioned my ha@@ dern with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of rob@@ ber@@ y , that is so sustainable the animals , of which it feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated , that it is therefore hungry at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar is it with the economy that grows to politics as far as the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power of the corporations grows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power of the corporations grows , increasing ine@@ quality , and the managing director of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their enterprises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ever more successful capitalism manufactures the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour and prosperity of humanity .
if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we need to assemble the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; re@@ tains control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t work very well .
the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should have been to reg@@ ain the working arms only through a miracle as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low noise levels by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long business and politics are separate areas , the automation lets the twin peaks are higher , the waste is su@@ bli@@ me , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon , as I think -- in countries like China .
so we need to re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we will be talking to the re@@ unified segment , otherwise we end in a hospital &apos;s monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cra@@ cy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; to appear as a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism has brought forth technical achievements , which he has produced , will survive --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to those in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve the human and the human energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I want to give you a few examples .
in the field of companies : ask a capital market before , in which you earn money , while you are working and in your capital you will follow you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you &apos;re working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and income from income and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
no distinction between those who are the company , who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not part of it . no exchange between capital and work , no great g@@ aps between investment and spin , and ultimately no emp@@ oral twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : ask for brief that our national currencies had a free fluctu@@ ating rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest threshold &#93; , is being spent in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency - we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos . &quot; and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade balance of the country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the 1944 Bret@@ ton Woods Conference .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ united policy and economy .
the world I describe it is simultaneously liber@@ ating , in which they privileged people preferred , and mar@@ x@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
are we w@@ aking up in such a world
or are we reconc@@ iled to a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do better democra@@ tically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Mar@@ xi@@ est in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : when something of what I said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do that , the technological development generate such a massive decline in total economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transfer@@ ring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we will see it currently , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low .
if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m totally in@@ verteb@@ rates .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your lecture mentioned you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of Red@@ ner you have very clearly said what you think about the view of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the response of a democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of it play , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a certain way , if I may say the so @-@ pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is today resem@@ bling the England of the 19th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed in China , resem@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now , to throw what the West has done in the 19th century itself , sm@@ ells sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as finance ministers from the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , we say about the self @-@ confidenti@@ ality , and the per@@ ishing den@@ ial that a massive offset line ran through the Eurozone , and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity on the basis of Greek pron@@ oun@@ cing -- by the way , the first suggestion was to deny this den@@ ial --
unfortunately , the powers of the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if we try to receive an economic system which is not viable to receive through political will and author@@ itarian projects , it will be delayed until then , but if the shift enters , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive .
BG : what change will you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we don &apos;t change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in a so cl@@ amped situation , he claims no mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the parties of the leg@@ islat@@ ure to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to bring out our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with those who ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that it has been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there &apos;s worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
no one from the Tro@@ ika of the leg@@ islat@@ ure imposed on this policy , conf@@ essed : &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er error . &quot;
BG : despite all , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of the talks , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my cri@@ tique of the European Union and the Eurozone facing someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone won &apos;t survive .
for if they do not survive , the released tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have been disast@@ rous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 that it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans , as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we are hoping that you will lie in this point wrong .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
the majority of Roy Price have never heard , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company by Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a snack and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content that will produce Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are already so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose anything .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows which are located right on this curve .
this curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after having looked at a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- it should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not reflect on the left side of the curve , because I think you have a special intelligence to accommodate &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average out@@ lines , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they don &apos;t just delight them .
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is making something special , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk its price .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he will hold a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch each one for free .
and if Amazon is available for free things , you don &apos;t know , right ?
millions of viewers are viewing this episodes .
however , they do not know that they are watched at watching this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team to record everything .
they capture when you start the show , when you p@@ au@@ ts , which parts you ski@@ p or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and hence gives the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republican US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the true meaning of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House goes on average with 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time , another manager has a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of running a contest , he and his team saw the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x @-@ viewer , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a w@@ agon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 @-@ rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
they have two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed .
they connect these many data together , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
for logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years to statistics as a back @-@ up .
it optim@@ ised by very powerful computers .
the minus , what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is somewhat frigh@@ tening , because we are living in a time we experience more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond the television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in jail .
if someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al takes place or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of choosing whether a show is good or bad , it will decide whether a person is good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there are evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always creates the best results . this is not true that a company like multi @-@ health system doesn &apos;t know how to use data .
also the data of sealed companies lie in@@ correctly .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worse species , we can predi@@ ct -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news of news . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly wasn &apos;t working anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , it was once again a sensation including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data circul@@ ates in decisions of life -- on the workplace , in the legal framework , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized gene@@ tics -- an area where some very wise men use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer treatment
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ sem@@ inated .
do you need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
as a serious dis@@ assemble this problem in his individual parts , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place , put together the individual parts to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and set up .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool , and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , parts and pieces will come together again , even if the information is incomplete to hold a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and understanding where they belong to the process .
they use data to understand their audience better , why they wouldn &apos;t have been able to make up all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not included in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first in order to compete for TV ideas , then voted &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and not to forget that , this device is rather useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for choices .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; and it &apos;s amazing . to make decisions by an Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will become a demo @-@ demo later .
I have met some choices in my life so far , I should have heard in the ball to the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them through something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball &apos;s wis@@ er and smar@@ ter and wis@@ er . finally , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something unusual at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that , despite the great amount of data , it still pays off decisions to make decisions , an expert in which you are doing , and risks .
by the end , it is not the data , but the risks , where you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very nice .
