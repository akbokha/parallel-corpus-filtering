<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA had illegally owned by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation in which the CIA overthrew his designs for nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter wasn't pleased?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government has identified Risen for almost 10 years and summoned him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became the symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn Whistleblower and spying journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constituent media, media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media don't get these information and if they cannot protect the identity of the patterns they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was anketed on Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something exceptional happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although it would have been essential for years that it would be essential for their fall, the government's demands were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time electronic monitoring, reporters and springs can always hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to fail and rape to make statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so investigators, without his consent, would be worried by telephone,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, credit cards, and even travel references with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA bohistleblower and risky source, to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, Justice has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Almost every article on national security has been the result since September 11 that a whistleblower fell to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, we use the game work on the game that will be protected by the first constitutional complaints, because the government has more opportunities to accept all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allows to avoid the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can take this from the moment in which they contact, instead of lying, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that has not yet been written than Risen had written his book, and it is considerably more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transfer system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet tradition, which was developed by us by Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been developed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server where the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot provide more information hidden, and many of the information they would like would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments develop new spy technologies that are all dangerous to us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is certain to ensure that not only technology components such as Edward Snowden have one way to bring iniquities. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The abnormalities at the supply of soldiers should know and report of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider that warns us prior to the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data leck of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that Reiche and Mighty] have hidden [enormous amount of money in tax havens.] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to form a statement.] this week, we were asked by news about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama-based Bar Association Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosque Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you judge this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to its first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister came back.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has admitted to control companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there's a lot of rich people and others, who are nervous about the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of a agency or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems, cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful in the location are to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few, to hide their assets and to kill -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will seem very confusing this whole world, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a Matryjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now, it is not so that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which this tax havens work, Mosque Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states, less information needs to give less information to found a company than to get a library code.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of inaction in the US has allowed employees of schoolchildren to be drawn from school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an investigator investigators in the offices of 13 legal firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Investigators gave himself as an African minister, who wanted to bring the suspicious money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that everyone could make suggestions to our investigator, as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pre-preaching. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who commits investigator's investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single leading pole, implicated in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to tackle this, we have to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very much senseless than if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I really see that a lot has to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years, we saw advantages to greater transparency, affecting the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">"" "" "" "the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013." ""</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has recorded at national level registers on national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have entered a bill in both parliamentarians but this does not do the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure in the US and globally for greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are mad if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that arise and say:" "" "inclear is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognizes the problem and use themselves by laws this kind of inaction.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally finish the intransparency, which now still makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I have been abducted almost and in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design studies, I made an amhoist.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he delighted to tell me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land off the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me saying:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "uh, like please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was then in bed, I waited for the ceiling, and thought: "Oh man! what have I broken up?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild man sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, swam tidy at the door, and shut up my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me is today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my viewangle completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood, actually friends who were waiting only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my airmaturage was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took air mats.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate draws and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there were a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new fellow occupier Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think we could earn something. our apartment will stay in a designer bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on wooden floors for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and fell the door into the castle, Brian and I was waiting for us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time, and pay our rent again?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves the investors: "we would like to create a website, on the people public pictures of their private homes, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, their doors one closes when visitors come over.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, they can invite their wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will become the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket would burn.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a shop that allows children to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because, as children have all learned, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you can contemplate the things that you can good. we could designate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptic -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to designate objects now, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never had met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a taste, which temperatures we aim.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone for your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet incinerary of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing, what more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell Twitter that he candieth for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor was first introduced only once with his name, if he had told how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 assessments, all say: "he can really hold off the mobile phones very well!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well-done feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to leave negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest were submitted before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted with Stanford a study. we examined, how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are similar to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising, we trust the people most, who are similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social default.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three convictions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation sticky similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we knew that confidence is dependent on how much they are.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When you say too little, for example "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Telling me too much, as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request will not be accepted as well.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great artwork in your apartment! I'm doing with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design, to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which issues you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to disclose these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are not allowed to celebrate parties or homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">The host have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front, when faith was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than these calls. it hurts, if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the lawyer, and will also be our greatest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, a fraction of 123 million nights only had a fraction.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted in each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If confidence is working, there may arise wonder.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host ran to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protection class that save one life, even though they don't know right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car into the hospital, when you dies, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they get books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, it doesn't run any stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure cash transactions are just what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled across the term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it's just simply the "rental industry" to call it, the thing is not just right.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, it is easy to compare it to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, if travelling a generous buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group there would be interested in a group there, to fill a thorough and one at a bar benches district, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be, if we would create flats of reason for sharing together?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have taken the idea of a common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us company and relationships, instead of loneliness and amortisation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in South Korean capital, Seoul, many places that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Now andwellers were offered. students who were looking for a stay, were offered,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people, whose children were moved out. they were incubated by Incubator,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. today, over our platform, 785 000 people in 191 countries are being hosted by a foreigner or himself host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just worked out?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the interests of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome a profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, if a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design can't solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use Design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, a brain laundering, a terror player?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So, people represent the media, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people don't talk with their Uber riders.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never learned to know a Muslims: it's great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealant fitness fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to decide that.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to oute me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to wear Hijab my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why are you suppressed yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: then it was a feminist declaration of independence, as opposed to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old to suit me a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have added with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, asked in question, doubted, and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion to deepen with any reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever have the feeling that someone you perceive, you fully understands and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began as all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in essence the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning was in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, gazed at the end, looked upon the screen and saw the word "breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disruption?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned himself rapidly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"... "... in the name of Islam..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "Jihad..."</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu transformed the deeds of others from a citizen into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to go through the Middle West in the US to move into a new city and start building studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how to keep quiet -- as we keep silent -- so deeply it went into my seat, and I was afraid for the first time to be known as Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved in this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard, and I read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "" "be vigilant," "" "Be careful," "" "Stay in well-lit areas" "", "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gathered to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And back the warnings: "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who kept for Muslims in the open, and struck them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There really was fire on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something was not feeling right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this land, have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have turned the rage of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people saying: "there is a problem in that country -- it's called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumor was removed as a whole and a benign tumor only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all the other Americans, no tumors in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, salvation, and Olympic risks.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people to tolerate people from other faith, and show greater citizens.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radio process, one has found that he begins online. as a first person, the person is cut off from their community, so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists may be the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we need to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group of the IS justified their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">"" "" "" "but we would add to us in their imaginations, if they recognise them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers." ""</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when one throws a look at them, they do not drive what they lases in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality which they can read these things in writing.</seg>
<seg id="346">An excellent Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she is the highways to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy, with whom she had spoken, brought them to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense for injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that had given their anger to anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalisation of extremists who spoke to their solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than accuse them for their anger, he demonstrated their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What it learned at the mosque, she kept it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight like the Islamophobia and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- indicate: if we fear ourselves, at least three things pass.</seg>
<seg id="359">We will rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when one reports trial news, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they agree more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of the American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic issue.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims were shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the lead of the war, and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to a Muslim terror, as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to caves the foundations of a free society, the reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts to us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In terms of collective guilt, it is not only about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental Faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most generous people, whom they knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her CV. she was intrigued and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did my father become such a sealed young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, she murdered her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, which was in the afternoon. he did in her apartment, as with an execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be morally, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was because of the America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one that we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We drove in silence with our son in the children's seat, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and drew up my shoes, and went into the building hall, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for the half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment, I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had compassion and compassion, and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanatismus?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go on safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or are you connected to those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what to say that you say that you're holding a TEDTalk to work a memorial with deep, in a noble memorial factory, so an exception and not the rule is.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say you don't deceive. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did so with the greatest of the study carried out to Muslims around the world, people want ordinary things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am an exception in all respects.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception to rule, then usually the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for Bastler, stands shortly before, to become a billionaire shop.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drinkers. it is possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcel to our social consciousness, autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower in France for a six-metre-high tower in France. some years ago they began to fly with healing.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting passengers reach high speed and acceleration on tight space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build autonomous structures, too.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, to deal with turbulence, and in general to react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to surpass the borders of the possibility in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system autonomous works, it must know collectively, where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new location technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our labs.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculated calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available on the highest level, e.g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane, trying to beat two flies with a folder.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most of the starters, it can hover, and thus large benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limiter of hedgesticker is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind böes.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device doesn't care in what position can be improved to the optimal position and improves performance by practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract issues, which turn to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known for around as machines with a thousand moving parts that accumulate to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots couldn't fly trailers, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong we discovered that flies only works with one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically easiest air device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and Querruder, no further actuators or controllers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much, so it can fly stable, and moving in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it right away if all look, is low, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in ingenious, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, one exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is just symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambitious in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the outstanding capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">To move in space to all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the fields of interactive rivers of the eight isoters.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is mentioned in models, the rest being learns directly at flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see it at all.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrucopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can the machine fly further, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now, making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine above Broadway wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wages in the development and the rhage act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that creative, wise creatures allow it to form a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economical potential, the dot is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">A very far distant galaxy approximately 1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are always quicker, they turned the mixture three times in a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lightened brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big pop.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally, we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure themselves and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We first order the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Just 1.3 billion years ago, just multi-cell lives had emerged on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, Earth has caused a lot to produce: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stand up -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- have a huge laser detector to look for gravitational shells caused by collizing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy genius so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser Interferometerm Observatory Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo could significantly increase what the detection performance improved enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the operation of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliant black holes throughout the earth through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector itself.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life's life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked for is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studied gravitation waves from black holes and their observatories, such as Ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crosary of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">During the passing of the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched into a direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate lecturers in courses for relativity, often a correctly albering dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and ducks, stretching and dustling."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitation waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and gested by the hit of the waves. the strain of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1st year, the Ligo staff declared for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of a nuclear program. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves in the way: "the technical difficulties in construction of such detectors are huge.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are sinclically and with the support of the public, all barriers will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott argued that Ligo was more than an eye than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. because so you can make a picture or a map of things that you can perceive from several points coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the tones this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, to close behind the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dost Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by doing changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the frequencies are measured in the audible area at least.</seg>
<seg id="521">So, if we convert wave pattern to sound, we can hear the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circulates simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotate the two body very quickly, you hear the same circle with an additional sound change. this sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of movement-chasing, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- Hearo heard the following: [Surrender noise] Someone who knows what he must hear, recognize this as a noise from -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sunmass, which rotate as fast as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 sunnen, the other with a mass of 36 probe, revolve for a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as never before was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to all and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can't see -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why living stars in super-novas explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical approach occurred in the core that lies behind thousands kilometres of iron, carbon, and silicon hidden.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since these oppressors are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation waves through iron, as if it would like transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the urine is covered by its own indulglowing.</seg>
<seg id="541">By gravitation waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we've never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we are only discovering that we listen.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo was right in the first ascent of things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo Project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are known as the sour cherries for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo makes us a completely different perspective on events in all, in the emergence of the stars, and ultimately, as we proceeded out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as brave as only possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build magnificent detectors and noises the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Have a dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year I would say to all "Yes!" I was afraid of that I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it made me nervous, brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I like to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I start playing with the spectacle?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, when I was afraid, frightened my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, keep talking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yeah that changed my life to an unexpected. it all began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, called all "shittens,"</seg>
<seg id="570">She would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-stick."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked them once I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yeah was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from then on, I swear to play with them, as soon as you can do with them. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- each single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am eager to try.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magic effect on me, on my kids, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently, I really understood that "yes" -Sagen to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think of things, do you revive for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I make television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I have television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for delivering 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show offers hundreds of jobs that do not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four TV programs, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes, which are simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes: episodes To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series will run one another on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world, my series of 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I created myself, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans on bonfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that will burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, so I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I tell it because I know what you think if the word" "" "author" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work as hard as you can, if you talk a company, a country or a classroom, to take me seriously, and it is true if I say: I understand that there is no dream about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything sweat - no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm grieve into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set up troops, I painted a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as you dreamed a high clay, I delivered a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and maternal, clinical and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when working is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums start in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums hear, as an animated road, I could go for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, when I tell them the sums that I would speak to my writing that writing is prepared to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started working with TV production, when I started working and work, build, create and collaborating, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">Swum is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have a sums, you can't strive different to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not otherwise to strive to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic to be.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a titanium, and I know I don't want to ask.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to clear one thing: the more successful I get, the more episodes, the more overcoming borders, the more fun there are, the more things the same time, the more observes me, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the mares, the swmen, the swmen, the swmen.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overtaken, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their mom is one single employee.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says, "Don't want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't loved my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15-hour days, a weekly weekend, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan sleeping is not available, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me it was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So, what do you do when what is doing, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know some might think: "Heul you out, the author of Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, you do, one loves to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, one painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another and that's what sums feel when sums stops when the sums stops, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stop, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "Southern States" "" "poses a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mama, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no, I will be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no more "hats."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan bin and my sums, and here everything changes in my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and lack of the sum, I cannot do anything but to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the screen, the high sound - they do not exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, tender, watchtower and the song in which it goes wrong, or whatever the girl get into "Die Eisqueen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can't believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy cherub arrives in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working season, the Titanensum, is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself, using broadcasts and TV hours and how working my brain is, I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no power and it is not labor specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the power, which comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of history, which is to be done, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but maybe God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child will play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free me as a workaholic from any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">If you don't play ansatas, how do you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at home as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a man does rather work than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of them is.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are flying around in the garden, and back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst out soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always attacker to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I wonder: why have we stopped playing with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! let them say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive, for a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It's just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladyton or biscuit replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teens daughter speak with me for 15 minutes, I am Mother of the Year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more need of it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can get 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No cell phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, children have to be done.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my charities, my world. it does not have to be the children. it applies to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm gging and I victories. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was playing a Titan in the training when I wanted to show myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes at a track, why not rest for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens up, and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown tune, they met me and my soul. I am guiding me on new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my job again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums is not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is mine that I am a titanium. I have never seen a Titan, who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet, I have everything in handle. my brain is still working. my bonfires still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country, which I create, the marathon, I run, the troops, the linen walls, the swmen, the swmen, the swmen, the swmen, the margins of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel like this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am the author. I think of things I've got up for life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit toleraty.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low ability to self support healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After serious breaches of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, trying to improve nerve functions by various surgical actions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Safely, they have heard of one of the most famous, the "deep-hirnstimulation." thereby you implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered heavy tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuuro-healing does not mean neuro cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to that.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conducting a Consultant and worked day and night in the staff.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often, I ordered patients with skulls-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that skulls-traumas-traumata will shines the brain and is inclined to the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, one must decrease the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a portion of swollen cerebral mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen cortment, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells from a tissue can grow, comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean François created it.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked just like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biology class that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cellular population, which looked like stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they provide a brain running brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of brain, since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source, which allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then the cells are exactly so cultivated as it did Jean François Hollande</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are then farmed to mark them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the removal of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells into woven brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after some weeks, they were taken over again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we made an injury and implanted just the same cells, and now the cells remained - they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Does these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets for one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they achieved a stable skill level, we ended in motorized Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the apes were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen at humans, it recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with plastic mechanisms. they recover at certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the apes, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its initial power from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after stimulation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found very much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it when people implanted too.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know somebody who can take this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely want.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look further into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and evaluate it, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">It is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is certain, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake, as of course, to consider.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant they are in reality, but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable things.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing have clearly proved that it is possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy is vanished with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- became clear to me as the finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not influence austerity measures that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, which would say to me that democracy would be abolished if she would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economical model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I beg you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup to have a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy our societies are mowed, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">Regarding waste, I would like to refer to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened with our corporations.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin peaks-paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the veritable austerity and corporations, which could be too timid to invest there where it could produce productive and incomes with which one could produce the debt mountain and could also produce all the things that humanity need urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States, in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, gas, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds like a lot of money until it was comparing to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do except the stock exchanges and real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-old in the United States, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and therefore a low total economic demand that could not invest in which they could not invest. just like Odipus Father, who could kill him, that his son would kill him when he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally, the circumstances bring about the circumstances that the oil will kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hadern with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "" "" "his extremely embellant art should be used to develop our lives, develop human talents, and especially to finance the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are crucial for salvation of the Earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the company's form to control the free and poor as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally concludes too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to impose the job value of athetic democracy due to these statements.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision at the athetic democracy was and is that she was involved in the working arms, and not only the right to free expression of expression, but more important and crucial that she gave them the right to political participation with the same balances in questions of heads of state.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not have long been held --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights very bright, it is burned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our roots democracies have not their roots in antique Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athetic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling democracy.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy did not begin when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible, and the democratic process was imited to politics during the economy -- so the world of the corporations -- a democratically-democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an inexhilarable struggle between the two where the economy gradually subsided and decidued them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you can be in the government nowadays, and yet not in power because the power of politics are migrated to the economy and the areas are separate.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadern with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of robbery, that is so sustainable the animals, of which it feeds, decimated, that it is therefore hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "similar is it with the economy that grows to politics as far as the self-caused economic crisis itself." "" "the power of the corporations grows," "" "the power of the corporations grows, increasing inequality, and the managing director of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their enterprises." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">Ever more successful capitalism manufactures the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that's true, it is obvious that we need to assemble the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't work very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should have been to regain the working arms only through a miracle as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low noise levels by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long business and politics are separate areas, the automation lets the twin peaks are higher, the waste is sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is already very soon, as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to reshape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we will be talking to the reunified segment, otherwise we end in a hospital's monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" to appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism has brought forth technical achievements, which he has produced, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to those in "Star Trek," in which machines serve the human and the human energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like, how could it look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I want to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: ask a capital market before, in which you earn money, while you are working and in your capital you will follow you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and income from income and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who are the company, who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not part of it. no exchange between capital and work, no great gaps between investment and spin, and ultimately no emporal twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: ask for brief that our national currencies had a free fluctuating rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest threshold], is being spent in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency - we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos." and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade balance of the country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in the background of a reunited policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe it is simultaneously liberating, in which they privileged people preferred, and marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Are we waking up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we reconciled to a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxiest in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: when something of what I said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy... do we do that, the technological development generate such a massive decline in total economic demand, which Larry Summers referred to as "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we will see it currently, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is accurate, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and that's why I'm totally invertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said. BG: in your lecture mentioned you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of Redner you have very clearly said what you think about the view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the response of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of it play, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I may say the so-provocative, China is today resembling the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">"" "for --" "" "remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically." ""</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now, to throw what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers from the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, we say about the self-confidentiality, and the perishing denial that a massive offset line ran through the Eurozone, and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity on the basis of Greek pronouncing -- by the way, the first suggestion was to deny this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, the powers of the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If we try to receive an economic system which is not viable to receive through political will and authoritarian projects, it will be delayed until then, but if the shift enters, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change will you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we don't change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in a so clamped situation, he claims no mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the parties of the legislature to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring out our government, only because they didn't want to deal with those who ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that it has been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There's worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">No one from the Troika of the legislature imposed on this policy, confessed: "it was a colossaler error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all, and despite the aggressive tons of the talks, you seem to be quite a pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My critique of the European Union and the Eurozone facing someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone won't survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the released tile forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have been disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>

<seg id="1035">BG: we are hoping that you will lie in this point wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you very much that you were at TED.</seg>

<seg id="1038">The majority of Roy Price have never heard, although it is likely to be responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company by Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a snack and describes herself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy can't choose anything.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows which are located right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after having looked at a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- it should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not reflect on the left side of the curve, because I think you have a special intelligence to accommodate "Toddler and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average outlines, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they don't just delight them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is making something special, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk its price.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he will hold a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch each one for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is available for free things, you don't know, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are viewing this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are watched at watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They capture when you start the show, when you pauts, which parts you skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and hence gives the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the true meaning of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House goes on average with 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time, another manager has a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of running a contest, he and his team saw the existing data on the Netflix-viewer, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1-rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">They have two very competitive, data sealed.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">For logic somehow says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years to statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimised by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minus, what you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is somewhat frightening, because we are living in a time we experience more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of choosing whether a show is good or bad, it will decide whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there are evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always creates the best results. this is not true that a company like multi-health system doesn't know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data of sealed companies lie incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worse species, we can predict -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news of news. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly wasn't working anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, it was once again a sensation including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data circulates in decisions of life -- on the workplace, in the legal framework, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very wise men use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer treatment</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a serious disassemble this problem in his individual parts, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place, put together the individual parts to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and set up.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool, and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, parts and pieces will come together again, even if the information is incomplete to hold a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and understanding where they belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience better, why they wouldn't have been able to make up all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which was not included in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first in order to compete for TV ideas, then voted "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "we tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and not to forget that, this device is rather useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for choices.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball" and it's amazing. to make decisions by an Ja- or no-question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will become a demo-demo later.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some choices in my life so far, I should have heard in the ball to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them through something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball's wiser and smarter and wiser. finally, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something unusual at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that, despite the great amount of data, it still pays off decisions to make decisions, an expert in which you are doing, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">By the end, it is not the data, but the risks, where you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very nice.</seg>
