Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt , where people are supposed to meet you@@ ths today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers make the sole cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not current .
it knows that everyone who had to get exciting , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i had a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ at@@ gas , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , are everything else - but therefore very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
it is evident that cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century as towns and municipalities have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ r carpet , which one can &apos;t recognize as such .
in the large over@@ visible card , cities and municipalities were detailed maps , so @-@ called world leaders .
these were created according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing Administration between 1810 and 1864 and in the first survey@@ ing of Bay@@ erns .
their client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
in Napoleon , Napoleon wanted to find an overview of the occupied country and issued a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns on behalf - of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops moved with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9 , 1801 , there were today &apos;s neighbours that create the idea of a wide @-@ wide Bavaria card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian State council .
the certificate for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is found like all other sites on the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of Early / What is most impressive in the state capital .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown .
an example of this is sub@@ mer@@ ling that is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after creating the map , so 1877 , the Munich district .
today , the abdom@@ en lies in the middle of the city .
the houses were concentrated in 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : in the zoom , a small @-@ piece card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; primitive &quot; which was derived from the fundamental tax .
little plots there are no farmers there - but small hus@@ band@@ men of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterised by sub@@ mer@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 scene of the October Revolution , was in the 19th century still a lawn - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map is an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the opposition of today , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , there are not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the hill &quot; on the air &quot; - but also in great letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , man locked once with mad@@ ness .
there was 1858 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was created on the Au@@ er Lü@@ th .
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den conducted the facility - that psychiat@@ rist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time , and finished the purchase of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the staff to turn violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients first of all , it was extended to 500 seats .
eventually , this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ tice in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts in Germany since 2006 .
young people are now encounter in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the order bought the building complex in 1920 , and turned it into a youth @-@ house with training facilities .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , East residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; house built in an architectural re@@ jection to the reference construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 1856 as &quot; main square , &quot; the Kauf@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
the Second World War also caused a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allied forces in December 1944 had holes in the city centre .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a tomb of the Middle Ages were once more at the Mari@@ enhof during these days , and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground @-@ breaking ceremony took place for the second S @-@ Bahn family .
with the shooting g@@ lean , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial view of today and the hole in the Mari@@ enhof stud .
civil Rights Group Publ@@ ished Travel War@@ ning for Missouri
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the promotion of dy@@ es has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks in the state after Missouri . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the state of Missouri , which is scheduled to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to leave particular attention through the state , as a number of frag@@ ile , racial @-@ based demonstrations in the recent period and indicated here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes it harder to gain discrimination against discrimination , as well as the law en@@ forcement agencies of the state to release the un@@ respon@@ sive to minority groups , promp@@ ted the group to release the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have injuries of the civil rights that will happen to people .
they will be put together or killed because of their skin color , &quot; said the president of Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organisation issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist failure to black students at the University of Missouri and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year , after having no fuel in the country by the state , and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also refers to a recently published report by the Office of the Office of Missouri by Missouri , which is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff inform about what could happen in Missouri &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring it to the account or to know the relatives that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hate crimes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the latest figures from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hass@@ elt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program , which states the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the it@@ iner@@ ary is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had published travel warning for Texas and Arizona , having adopted the local prosecution authorities to arrested people because of mig@@ rant workers , which will benefit from AC@@ L@@ U to further racial abuse .
the travel warning are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , stakeholders have the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
fence project is elementary
the fishing net project is a success project , and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU Bundestag and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac took a picture in front of the spot .
in the right @-@ grave of the Sch@@ wen@@ demann family , representatives of the fishing industry came together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EPs .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ demann initially granted insight into its operation in which he houses 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many k@@ itt@@ ens and houses in five apartments .
the Black Black milk &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eters for him of the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ demann .
only regional . at the table of the agriturismo , regional .
since he is also called the BL@@ HV @-@ chair of Fis@@ bach , he described the fence project as &quot; elem@@ ental . &quot;
I can &apos;t grow in such steep surfaces .
green land care for a lot of work , much needs to be processed with the sco@@ re@@ sense .
&quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ demann stressed .
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ istic operation and ordered this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not lead to bio operation .
Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the significance of the femin@@ ist project and is glad about the leader of the leader . &quot;
the farmers are estimated at cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare .
we hope that the capacity of the areas could still be moved out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often standing in cri@@ tique
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the open space is 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ warded until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 Euros , half of the leaders was funded , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
consequently , the farmers were 12 610 million , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of electric f@@ ences .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac empha@@ sized : &quot; you do not do a good job without farmers and country women . &quot;
also for Peter White , the best food is being produced here . &quot;
the landscape of agriculture ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of Wei@@ de@@ f@@ ences .
the aim is the dis@@ closure of the Black Forest .
the pre@@ mise is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r reported conveyor lines .
moreover , the fenced area may not be to@@ g@@ able ( crossing a slope above 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the performance .
for the fis@@ her electric fence in 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build a fence about 16 kilometres of fence .
the open area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est character of a regime change is to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate these as well as every other - therefore the fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s place at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologist of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN on the proposals of the President to dramatic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have laugh@@ ed at him when he had done it .
but he attacked its importance , and in particular the importance of it was written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty ... a symbol of American freedom that enlighten@@ ed the world .
the poem you refer to , that was later added , and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively properly , but as he form@@ ulated itself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemp@@ tible words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your weary , your poor , and your bro@@ th@@ ron@@ ed masses , who lon@@ gs to breathe freely , and the w@@ ading trou@@ gh of thy rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ eventh waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly showed that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to do their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that she has completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American Republi@@ cans by presenting the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this importance : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and they themselves have a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the ge@@ al with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to move from the right wing already long .
the great scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty has arrived , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atory that bring the American flame into the re@@ covering world : &quot; lady Liberty goes on .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way to the United States . &quot;
rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is stum@@ bled on a bit .
the significance of the statue is quite and a matter of perception .
the great phant@@ asi@@ ly deed of Lazarus was to see them as they looked by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often hor@@ r@@ endous travel on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome , which they have to hear .
and that &apos;s not the perspective , Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
her tor@@ ch shall not give the way to shine , but the hatred that is the only source of power is infl@@ amed .
Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle re@@ members a time when only two Schot@@ ts belonged to the UK team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance of the Athletics Men of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of World Championship races &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will afford a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes will be selected for London 2017 on Friday .
black believes that &quot; Scotland has developed something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the road corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 square meter , while E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle was chosen from the team to the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
her chapter speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the passion and the genuine feeling that gave E@@ ili@@ ie quite naturally , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth Silver medal winner , who will compete at its fifth world cup at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it &apos;s &quot; incredible &quot; is that 16 gravel in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ stream Mu@@ ir leads this way back to five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Doyle reminds himself of her first World Championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was in the Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the teams say that they are &quot; enor@@ m@@ ously proud of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only among the team , but in some cases also at the medals and the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing to be part of the team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , making it something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ dien .
what concerns my speech as chapter ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home World Championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking the critics on Facebook : do not work for a public office if you don &apos;t want to feed your voters .
the Father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from the domestic policy up to its political principles .
he conclu@@ des with the cri@@ tique , for sure .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in the year 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we will be led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland by Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 people and have deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union comp@@ eted him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the staff of the Governor &apos;s rod dismissed the suit as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freezing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest consent of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has showed a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play@@ fully his hair @-@ out head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons , which come to the page of the Governor - which is a public forum , which is officially called officially and by employees working with public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily , and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the acts of the Governor and argued that the comments of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ ut or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ass@@ ure people who can slide the whi@@ p online .
the mail spoke to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who talk with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the parish quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
lawyers of Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD , was not h@@ ass@@ ented , but she asked for hate speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people in the same issue will take place , then it is rather regarded as a so @-@ called collective deployment and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the employees of the Governor &apos;s &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critics or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in the past time , when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conduc@@ tivities and to kill or demonstr@@ ators to silence .
but that just happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , which is critici@@ zed for him to compl@@ ain Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County was the last Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they named a elec@@ torate from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers carried out between 1776 and 1800 and anonymous letters beat on his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous consol@@ es .
people who used P@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that make Washington &apos;s decisions .
petitions which critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trading and navigation in the UK have overwhel@@ med his position , according to the historic documents collected by the George Washington Project .
but he did not make them silence .
freedom of expression , opinion of opinion , and dis@@ courses are part of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hoping for domestic convenience in Renaissance club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is hoping for the next three days , as the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost the links to the final round in Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the final year before being connected to Paul E@@ ales as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he met his praise with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job as he placed this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous war@@ ding of this game , and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels particularly , &quot; said the player in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because they won them in the year after I was taken out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories came back from last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came after his 50th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior Tour , returns to the action on the home floor .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it &apos;s always a bit more , when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel these additional pressure .
I really enjoyed it again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how far has gone . &quot;
with the trio on the field the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major champ@@ ions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish .
OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Schot@@ ts on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance is free , the parking fee is £ 5 per car with an insert and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passi@@ v@@ smoke
over the past two decades less people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Medical Center Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) results in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases attributable to passi@@ v@@ smoke is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hei@@ ko Becher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved with his own study on this issue in 1994 .
at that time there were 400 lung cancer cases of passi@@ vity per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house circuits tend to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and , &quot; reas@@ onably in time , &quot; says the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of home connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as the underground is much disp@@ le@@ ased , which is not noticeable in the plans .
traffic , which continues to hin@@ der the construction work , represents a major problem for the construction rate of the St@@ ump@@ p company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignor@@ ance of drivers in front of red lights and bul@@ locks are already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the line bus@@ se are entitled to the entrance .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z by the company St@@ ump@@ p has been working with the works on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite st@@ ress@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;

when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use stove .
they even rarely used a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of P@@ ani@@ ai shel@@ ters in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potatoes - locally as a &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the stolen buttons is taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also runs their daily work , e.g. dresses with cloudy water from the nearby mar@@ sh .
a bucket in a homeless area serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of their husband , their fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be too dangerous to work : most of the vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drinking hard , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one is dar@@ ing to around at 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hig@@ hl@@ ands of Papua New Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders were able to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta who maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
the town with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo sticks , and made of cor@@ ru@@ ble@@ ach , which were converted by r@@ ust in various yellow tones .
only very few Indon@@ esians lived here , for@@ ge journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian missionaries arrived , the Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans learned a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her pale rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s maternal and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but there is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high land@@ provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort increased gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua New Mexico &apos;s natural resources have an estimated $ 78 billion worth .
these riches , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for the coast to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military preser@@ ves a ch@@ oked presence .
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
today , Pap@@ u@@ anian demands thre@@ aten this golden G@@ ans and will be treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to the activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass graves in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tri@@ bal country in the 1970 &quot; s became in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will Under@@ stand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in a report of the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 where reports on atro@@ cities are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular according to another report - and brutal defe@@ ats peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have intensi@@ fied as Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes , as Muslim economic mig@@ rant originate from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning Cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pean@@ ut sauce .
local people strug@@ gling around here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua New Guinea , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ ai native native to work in the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has occupied the native coast - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua New Market . &quot;
the Indonesian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , said during his election campaign in 2014 , the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations in Papua New campaign .
the former Zimmermann assured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua New York , including P@@ ani@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua it has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai had only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers broke out on a motorbike by the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their spot@@ light .
one of the soldiers took refuge in their tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , struck the group with their defense , said sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so difficult to get that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby governmental Commission was set on fire and the things are escal@@ ating on the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military commander centre to demand justice .
they wore cereb@@ ral hunting animal and led the Wa@@ ita dance - continuously and a bird @-@ singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to to@@ w stones at police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , a command was sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TIM@@ E document that was not released in local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was to listen to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot down in my left hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball from the ranks of the soldiers came together .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who like many Indon@@ esians only bears a name , the TIM@@ E in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the che@@ ers spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said repe@@ ats that his officers only wanted to secure their station &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many injured .
the news about killing took place only on the following day &apos; after Jak@@ arta .
in three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i appeared in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ ware , the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case immediately solved , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Secretary of Security Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he uses an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling of historic human rights ab@@ uses .
but the pron@@ unci@@ ation started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we have committed us to tackle these things , but there are processes that have to run through , &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he said on June 5 in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said he had no plans in order to establish a complaint mechanism .
instead , everything is regulated , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , which accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were settled in Papua New Zealand , including P@@ ani@@ ai incident .
families of P@@ ani@@ ai victims met such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ers .
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es says .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I was buried , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the shooting houses have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a farmer who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ zu Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he fis@@ her in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
in front of the company premises prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw the stones on officers , re@@ acted by firing warning shots .
but native people say that the mobile Brigade ( ind@@ on@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killed one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the past here is delivered quickly , so the TIM@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to draw the officers to withdraw the officers and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ ff for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green land of Papua .
many closed the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua attacks by pushing up spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ apping of ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders came from P@@ ani@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response , thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua is P@@ ani@@ ai known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they reserve the most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold to the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a are only 10,000 ind@@ on@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities grew between the indigenous coast and the new migrants , which since the opening of new flight gro@@ ov@@ ing to the airport of Nab@@ ire in bigger number .
the few jobs that exist in the region do usually go to the better trained and weal@@ thy migrants .
Papua New Guinea rarely have the capital or the necessary capabilities to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of P@@ ani@@ ai &apos;s headquarters .
isol@@ ates the eyes of the world from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media are ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare auth@@ orization to the movies .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaigns were to raise the limitations of coverage to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report about Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Salom@@ on@@ - Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua New and widespread injuries . &quot;
since the same countries , the same countries have seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r showed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to disgu@@ ise the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people want to know more foreign governments to be aware of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura moved their silence and th@@ ron@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that took part in the meeting , but remain anonymous .
in 2019 , Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Papua will probably agree that they probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ shots , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants Y@@ ok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai nation , apart from that , lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poverty educ@@ ators and health service .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ people , like other Papua , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want just righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ment families , families of P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ Shi@@ fts led a last symbolic act of the Des@@ p@@ ite : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a site precisely opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps there will never be righteousness to them , but at least they don &apos;t let those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with her head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire Colle@@ ct the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire found on Friday in one of the highest residence towers of the world in Dubai through the book and forced hundreds of residents , from 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years by the high @-@ rise building , which is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , violations were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we are standing at the fire alarm and scre@@ aming people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor down , &quot; told a inhabit@@ ant named George An@@ ab , Reuters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4,@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooling down .
the government said she was working on the provision of accommodations for the suffer@@ ers .
the incident may cause questions regarding the safety of materials that are used in out@@ lines of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 found that the largest part of the damage caused by disgu@@ ise , the outer covering to decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police said , they believe that the system of records for isol@@ ating and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June is the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the next two @-@ third majority were supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup singles not only by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classic stay the traditional competitors .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work , to improve the rate .
not only at the vote , after many contradic@@ tions , the proposal has come to pay the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will continue to host the host in the first round .
in order to reduce the organizer costs , the requirements are facil@@ itated in training places , etc , and players will have to participate in the Davis Cup at less official media event .
more than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers offer forbidden objects into the aircraft , find a survey
a survey carried out under flight pass@@ ers found that more than 20 percent consci@@ ously affected or un@@ consci@@ ously forbidden objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration is s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , among them at least 6 percent , which stress the plane while they acci@@ dentally used knife or other objects with clin@@ ches .
less than 1 percent claimed that they had never been discovered that they were wander@@ ing with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 persons - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather desp@@ ise the rules .
of those questioned that they have tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common objects that were inten@@ tionally passed to T@@ SA agents were foods and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have applied objects with clin@@ ations caused by security check , while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents were confirmed that they deliberately had brought up drugs into the plane .
the company said it has advised trav@@ ellers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dental mu@@ g@@ ing@@ ware were brought by the airport safety and how many would have done it inten@@ tionally .
it is no surprise that people who wear the most s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or ignor@@ ant , those who were most often flying .
however , the company points to the fact that the T@@ SA direc@@ tives are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are uns@@ afe , which liquids they may take away , or how much of it .
there is no surprise that the biggest crowd of the T@@ SA were seized or prohibited liquids .
for a long time , the people thought T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla @-@ customers cancel orders
electric @-@ thou@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k will be happy with the huge number of reservations for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 .
so far , he has so far suggest that some of the customers have withdrawn their un@@ binding reservation already .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant numbers , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k also claimed another , less smooth figure at the announcement of the recent quarterly survey : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k was often recruited with the more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose extradition is just starting .
now Mus@@ k was dre@@ aming : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3.000 have been withdrawn .
critics have always noted that there is only in@@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the € 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in Great Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are currently under analy@@ zing in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the cancellation of some twelve percent of all orders may be made to the problem , however , the Tesla boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the past year , Tesla supplied 8@@ 4.000 vehicles .
2018 - all models are to be merged - 500,000 , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who ordered today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; may be ordered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new , never in practice tested production lines without further inter@@ rup@@ tions .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the dis@@ comfort of the reservations can be made for Tesla .
for then , the Company can &apos;t hin@@ der customers , get away in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to reducing emissions from the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew its earlier decision to delay the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g caused air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , as his agency proved to have the needs of state environmental authorities against respon@@ sive faster than previous administration .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous post in a Federal Appe@@ als Court .
it is a deadline that ran off on 1 October for states to hold the o@@ zone standards for under@@ floor zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt told in June that he will not hesitate to delay a year to study the plan , and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interv@@ ene in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was arrested by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s prosecutor in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time for a long time more reliable environmental protection .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block or delay regul@@ ations , to which the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuel has resi@@ sted .
the sudden turn of Wednesday is the latest legal response to the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA publishing house exceeded his authority than he tried to delay the implementation of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane output .
in a on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ce suggested that his turn @-@ up in o@@ zone standards just struck the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of the tim@@ ely fulfilling of the new standards .
&quot; under earlier administ@@ rations the EPA has often not kept the dead@@ lines for the implementation , and then to be charged with activists and others to establish an appointment for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in government regulation , and we take me@@ kins seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also accept the law and authority , which gives us to serious . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually will use his &quot; satisfaction to delay and to all other legally available to their disposal , to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
in the last month of approval bill , the implementation of the rules of 2015 will be delayed by at least eight years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure has not been put to vote in the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the National Coalition led by the EPA in this week , said the Group intend to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the Smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said dres@@ sm@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York settled in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sylv@@ anian , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ Oz@@ on is created when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the resulting Smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups , and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists jubil@@ ated over P@@ ru@@ itts course of course .
&quot; it is worried about how much pressure it takes to receive this reasonable step of the responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .

750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16 at 4.@@ 30 pm .

the visitors from the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chant for this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and promot@@ er of tum@@ ours to their inten@@ tions .
Walter Martin@@ i emphas@@ ises : &quot; it &apos;s a unique beautiful i@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle had been mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ ical Lutheran Church , Count Hermann von Sul@@ z , and the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; on mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document , according to the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church , a splendid farm , to which the church or the patron was belonged to and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 1858 , alongside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still to recognize today in the village of Tum@@ our , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent sett@@ ling centre of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 are Moor@@ ish these historical practices .
the patron was created from the early medieval Memorial .
a master built a church , and occupied with a priest , remains the owner of this church and was able to inherit it .
this was supposed to be the right to master a priest , or to the bishop a new priest .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two crum@@ bs to Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was then released in 16@@ 92 , but subsequently had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the shut@@ ters were wrapped and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in the year 1796 , French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened by 1809 .
by 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ary Church was demolished .
only the steep@@ le left .
in the New Year &apos;s eight , a storm split the steep@@ le and the half collapsed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was abor@@ ted .
only the existing tower @-@ value was still existing today as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; creative pension@@ ers &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
as organis@@ ers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , at the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Kepler High School of Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.m .
for the long @-@ length of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk take place in front of the cemetery .

the ser@@ en@@ ade is only taking place in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters to the ob@@ taining of the historical St. Hil@@ arius system , which is important for tum@@ ours and horns .
the friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours feel particularly committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Martin@@ i .
Club wants to check out the permission of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim hurt himself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned on the coun@@ cil@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is encouraged to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal to take place .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen , only on the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind power concentration zone .
in this concentrate , construction and operation of wind power plants are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration zone also causes a exclusion of wind power use for the other urban area .
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had a few days earlier , a second wind turbine @-@ zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette decided - but it was not approved by the Düsseldorf District government in Düsseldorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the missing legal requirement , the authorized auth@@ orization of approval was un@@ lawful and therefore to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an approval of the District government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the issu@@ ance of permission for the creation of wind energy plants is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle uph@@ olds the entrance fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received at the circle of Vier@@ sen since the past week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to re@@ examine the matter again .
however , they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view on ongoing procedures at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express itself to the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines .
last year , the company had already been involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen has been involved in lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of four wind energy plants , the electricity demand for around 11 400 households should be covered , equivalent to roughly one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ adult households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Fourth Coun@@ cill@@ or gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cra@@ ck@@ les together : woman dies off horri@@ ble accident
a terrible road accident has occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ w ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was wounded .
two other people were slightly hurt .
the state road remained blocked over hours .
following a police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman came from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their car in passenger car with their 53 year @-@ old mother as an esc@@ ort by the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel .
city and retail@@ er plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will be re@@ discovering shops in the city center in September .
the commercial club and the city authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract inhabitants for shopping in the city center .
as the chairman of the commercial law , Christian König , announced , the &quot; homeland sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend should raise the customers for this , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
according to this , a market with regional providers , similar to the market market .
in addition , native companies are to present their apprentic@@ eship .
moreover , the shops of the city centre will invite to &quot; mit@@ re @-@ shopping &quot; shopping center .
the action is not only based on residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , advertising spots on radio , a web video and printed bag , refer to the action weekend , so Christian König .
the city administration and commercial club cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the commercial club and the city go to another stage of the &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City &quot; project .
these include new offers as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ fest and sold on Sunday , talks with all tra@@ ilers and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the authentic@@ ation on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
customers should also be re @-@ re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
they belong to the guests and tourists .
but many locals have lost the downtown shopping at the sight .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city center - up to land@@ lords , farms around the city and clubs .
he sailed with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , which had spread out , had said King in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities participated in the nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
next to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ y@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Abi@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for appreciation of local trade and its meaning for the community of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action among the I@@ HK &apos;s lead in the I@@ HK and with many partners is also obvious that each citizen can influence his direct @-@ ordin@@ ated environment .

Tr@@ ump bet after teleph@@ oned tran@@ scription of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone conversation with the Mexican President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to stop publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US President refused him because he had den@@ ounced the wall , and said to him , &quot; This allows you to say the press &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall in the southern border of the USA , and to pay for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first attack with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turn@@ bull has also been released and revealed a decent exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Gy@@ ump said that a trade for the USA hi@@ ves to take over &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; that the existence of the trade which had been convey@@ ed by Obama as a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; would look like a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the phone call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford Mass@@ acre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ spe@@ c Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in the rural retreat , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver , a group of white men with guns came out to block his path .
the leader of the M@@ obs - a man middle @-@ aged woman in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside in@@ doors the occup@@ ants were in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man is ro@@ aring .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scar@@ ves torn the silence , when a young black man was distor@@ ted from the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 was only a reproduction .
but if a loop will be thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all of them were very genuine si@@ gh in the audience .
since 2005 Citiz@@ ens have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an was gel@@ ding in 1946 .
nobody ever was indicted for murder .
&quot; it is truly in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years no one person was arrested , although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization .
&quot; it &apos;s a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizenship .
it serves as a dramatic call for action , and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that a in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want the ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can not get to healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a place of court lays a towel on the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files , who received from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody ever was indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot in decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 made a decision of the Supreme Court to release the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote their voice in the summer .
about the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI &apos;s black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly due to a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore it , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to jail .
but when they were then approached by the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des this from an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , elimin@@ ating evidence and has denied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is going to form@@ ulate it yet .
&quot; it was a constitu@@ ent massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; you were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register , and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual demand by Moore Ford &apos;s Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe he doesn &apos;t exist in America .
it is difficult to look , and even more difficult to see , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are confron@@ ted with its hem@@ or@@ ality in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot establish a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to listen to what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - in a room and lau@@ ert when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the pieces .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ C@@ lan@@ member for years , but he said , the role never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story back because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room check the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester ex@@ ams and pressed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ asted away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a bl@@ eth the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the loud .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still ch@@ uck@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot;
&quot; yet , &quot; one of the other black actors .
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos;@@ R. &apos; .
and exactly there is the energy in the space , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy doing this correctly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed men .
the scene once again begins .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends non@@ violent and fast .
there is terr@@ ors , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a funeral dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and will take advantage of the praise &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sc@@ ans sweat and tears off the eyes .
the audience is divided equally between black and white .
a couple travelled from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many get down just the street .
you have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as impressive moisture almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the kill@@ ings remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one took place in the same country , where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air will be donated .
if the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene loads the amount to come closer and to insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ bs to their heads , register the fake blood and the breast@@ feeding bodies and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy , as he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the amount - and suddenly it is over .
actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch away and wi@@ pe out their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a surro@@ unds two of his co @-@ player and then dra@@ gged along in her arms , and finally breaks the emotional burden of the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sit together with the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair from Atlanta plays a white pair with a black pair , which she had just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski tried to find words , which feeling the performance left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear this terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you yourself and those who do what they look like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks courtyard keeps on his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning a performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspired in a certain way , because she describes the terror of what we bear , but there is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we did not learn anything , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever doesn &apos;t know his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own history is convicted to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ h@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf presents a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging of a gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop .
the rotation stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) can be found alternatively a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo made of GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine is pos@@ ing as a rock group , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
pil@@ ed oil barrels recall Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ leit@@ v - Money , Power and Gi@@ er - draws up through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhine @-@ pop@@ es - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ izes as &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
they run Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , crushed in Hollywood @-@ style a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give T@@ ie cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weights .
brutal the scene when he performs Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe on their turn .
the audience ow@@ es the ensemble with powerful applause .
from stor@@ my , Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who dec@@ ei@@ ves themselves and deep@@ ened the hands of the Merkel @-@ rob@@ bing .
there is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat back in empty leisure clothing .
the appearance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam .
in 2013 , he had to have a more hil@@ ly concert concert in 2013 , five years later , in which the &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went underground .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said just before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of whose visibility has grown .
I prefer a positive res@@ ume .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work at several sites in their volunteer year .
where to everywhere ?
amount : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once in the week I can help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in an open full day .
what are your experiences with this ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
now they are 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does it come from ?
quantity : I have taken high school .
and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I realised for me that it is wrong for me , and I want to do something else , working with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
get a social year , since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the burning , maybe , really is .
and was it like this ?
crowd : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I will be dual to study , probably in Ju@@ er@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual during the volunteer for several different applications ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to point where to make his FS@@ J .
you can do it from home @-@ home to youth work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon .
for me it was just the right thing I was irrit@@ ated .
I could realize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in construction studies ?
a lot : well , here it is not about to calculate st@@ ati@@ ken .
you always have other people in front of each other , which each have a different story behind .
if a refugee , if a youth who has been taken out of the family - you must always go out individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have contact us ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life .

due to un@@ confirmed local reports , there were also three civilians during the incident in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a position of NATO , the explosion occurred on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army attacked impro@@ vised explo@@ sions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injuries are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the Airport B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby b@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city has killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the troops invaded the Taliban by force in 2001 .
violence under@@ scores the pre@@ valent security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in the past few weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies , and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns to the delay of Smo@@ g Rule by Kl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a government regulation of Obama , cancelled which the states are obliged to de@@ file the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the step@@ ping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the agency &apos;s commitment to collabor@@ ate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA , which should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions in which one part of the country have to be established to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint against Tuesday on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re @-@ raise a wide range of environmental impacts , former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that will boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have caused the decline of demo@@ cr@@ ats and protection groups , which concerns about the effects of larger emissions in public health .
the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains , &quot; reducing the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and intensi@@ fy respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
common plan wants to be common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts the municipal council of Flu@@ orn win@@ ks decided to establish a common room in the future of the retirement homes .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining lack of land was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports .
while it is still going to last until now , until now the church &apos;s church is owned , there is no planning factor for the project of a private investor to st@@ em@@ ulate project .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and a neighboring terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council , such a common room , are not seen as a meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ est living space but open to the community .
as an example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the lap .
the decision made by the provision of funds for the running budget has already been decided in the last autumn .
construction is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a shared room would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision looks to sign@@ alize the investor , that in this regard , there will be no p@@ ushes between the legs , the ar@@ tis@@ ation is le@@ aned - as well as pulse @-@ roof , which reduces tr@@ inity level and the construction of economic power - would be possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried sole , is this addition .
if it helps : unanimously he happens the panel .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
Daniela call refers to the many own buildings , with which you don &apos;t come so right now , because they are now on the common room with the window , says : &quot; I am so hard for me . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks to the common room - but absolutely against a public participation .
it sees behind it a covered sub@@ sidy of anyway total assets or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the floor you don &apos;t give an allow@@ ance , but get a real , in doubt that is in doubt , the counter @-@ speech is .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers petition to ple@@ dge the resolutions , finds three advoc@@ ates .
so it remains in two counter@@ parts at the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes as follows : &quot; if we put the decision , we make a huge step into our infrastructure . &quot;

in the Har@@ z of Stern hiking
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will emerge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the place of the association Observ@@ atory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; come to meet the information needs of many har@@ vest@@ ers , named it .
it combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
members want to wake up the planned route tablets and inform about stars and star pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase of 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ att@@ ain@@ able installations plans to reach five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets are to be updated on the Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception takes place at the site selection .
accessibility is also a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star train station is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star section the viewer admi@@ res a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
moreover , they learned why stars could have different colors , or why a star stronger than another , although he was much further away .
also , in which constellation is a chosen star , and when he is best to see .
the club has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg on the highest located constellation of northern Germany since 2014 .
the site in the middle of the national park of Har@@ z is one of the Federal Ministry for Nature Conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently there are from the Mil@@ ky Way Galaxy and even the Andro@@ meda Galaxy with naked eye clearly .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt has been on the initiative of the sponsor@@ ship Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen since 2003 , something similar to the planned star@@ dom - the planet road .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , the planetary road leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Equ@@ est@@ ries ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ alls with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ based plug@@ to at the end point - are exactly positioned at a distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , the sun measures 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
the total distance of the planetary gear is a good four kilometres .
while the light takes about eight hours to the Plu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ akes with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fixed star , however , would last half a year .

I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 19 o &apos;clock to ES@@ PN .
as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko Manager Eg@@ is Climate , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; remembered Garcia .
&quot; I have risen to Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to get on light @-@ weight .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand this .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this struggle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans have asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia and pushed back later to fight with the network that the best financial package offers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .

both said they could feel the moment@@ um , which , for their own struggle , might sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that needs to be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle generates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured tire block@@ ers
on Thursday afternoon , four people were seriously wounded during an accident on the A7 .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost 16 : 30 shortly before the connection of the market , the control of its vehicle is expected to be over by a vehicle .
the car s@@ cour@@ ged to the right into the ar@@ gues , where he survived and then lay down on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
whereas the emergency service provided by the emergency service , the A7 toward the north was closed for an hour , and afterwards the traffic on the left strip leads to the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ aming chain works better &quot;
And@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener in Braunschweig for the end of the season op@@ ener , that the optim@@ isation of def@@ ensive information is in au@@ e points .
with the first seasonal game , And@@ re Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , if not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents to be too much , and we have to fit in au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the thresh@@ ing chain should also be optimized .
and a gate after a lift , the Fort@@ ress would not influence themselves anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be that no longer turns out to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better righ@@ t@@ ted after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how we are working in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Radio , but Hoffmann is safe because of the three @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build on well , said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that we are still harmon@@ ious and we do not afford such a lot of errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t have to talk about a mis@@ erable start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the trop@@ hy , we will certainly be able to talk of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his train@@ ers wanted to know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start in the season I am just after six to eight game days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony was broken in Hei@@ den@@ heim due to a we@@ aker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can quasi start the season with a home match , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player from Au@@ e maybe even a little bit more fresh , since she had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una on the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 per cent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ending of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a little favorite on Sunday to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium in Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we blow them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is just a positive defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one must strike from pre @-@ start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to do his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine has started the test of tests last year .
they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) for defects in ass@@ essing the correct age of several refugees was critici@@ zed at age .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 880 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency was informed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly constant during the past months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases , in which the person was evaluated as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has to be over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the examined person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet paper published the 5@@ 81 results , it noted that in 243 of those cases the person had said that they become 18 years old .
the method of medical evaluation at the X @-@ ray and MRI images of kne@@ e @-@ joints have been analysed , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist , Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work constitutes the assessment of the biological maturity of people , to see if they went earlier or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we can &apos;t be sure , we shouldn &apos;t do that , as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of testing : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being a child as an adult is easy to judge , low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
working on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are coming well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part of the bridge was installed on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of road traffic and transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , working at the same time began working on all three refurb@@ ishment bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure to keep the timet@@ able .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch @-@ stretching bridge from concrete that is lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
like the two other bridges , she has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead about the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cover on Wednesday morning .
this is a boundary that is also used as a run away .
the southern part of the bridge is supposed to be a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cover on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should be run .
the particular concern is that it concerns manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berg company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge .
the handling of lines provided by the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach ( Lau@@ ter@@ bach ) .
because there is also a glass fibre cable attached to which many companies are connected .
local residents were informed of the project in advance by hand@@ outs .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be caught .
for the bridges between the building of the building and the collection in direction Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic is covered in a lane by a traffic light .
for the construction of the bridge on Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher &apos;s entrance , the road is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three cen@@ timet@@ res are 700 000 Euro .
it is funded by the country .
Af@@ ol@@ stein in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t come so often that parties go on a strand but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , there is something difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties of the parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a wide alliance , which shows that day peac@@ efully , because the Af@@ ro in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell invited to a poster &quot; large election campaign . &quot;
and famous names at the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forming the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chair Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are before the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ re@@ actors , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ro @-@ Event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the Forum One World and one of the decisive organis@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and a lot of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , who could also eat Af@@ ro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence , mainly at the train station , which is just a few metres away from the event locations .
so how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
he reports Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ ro volcanoes , he has been trying to get an event and get a surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was wonder@@ ing at the Dau@@ n in Dau@@ n , but there was not a cancellation because of the Lau@@ ren@@ tial Church , not enough parking spaces are available .
so now that Ron@@ dell , hom@@ eb@@ ox is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peac@@ efully . &quot;
it also does : at 20 o &apos;clock there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate Af@@ ro @-@ Chair@@ woman of Uwe Young .
in the hall are about 200 listen@@ ers that wait for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chair Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch will hold its speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour is the Af@@ ro @-@ Event , the guests at the fore@@ court have a longer breath , but there is also short after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can pull down - no special inci@@ dents .

both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European leaders .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a solo orchestra of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the lust , not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments , but also merge the limits of different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new look at the two such as in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; World Music &quot; combines with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz cup of jazz , mix classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating world art .
this piece of the program was first performed in Freiburg &apos;s huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ake wrote it specifically for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its special acou@@ sti@@ cs will be deliberately imported into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart has openly openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I sat in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most famous relationship of Hollywood @-@ stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally broke out bitter .
despite all , the brunette she as@@ sures against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I noticed .
or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten gave birth to be bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I &apos;ve always lived and believed the du@@ alism .
so it never made me confused or hin@@ der me .
I never liked it never to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially among them they ri@@ dden it according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; but in the school period , as they rather disgu@@ ised as a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was 11 , the children , I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed .
now look back and think to me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they don &apos;t love to live her love : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me .
and perhaps some are regarded as und@@ am@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot;
West Virginia Governor , announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether you like it or not , the Democrats got away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayer and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play a different game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a major announcement on the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t miss the Democratic Republic of Hillary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire according to Forbes , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes states that he has inherited carbon@@ em@@ ines in five states , and has inherited a carbon store from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
meanwhile , the Republican National Committee on Thursday evening announced a statement in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , which would rather move forward to making our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 g@@ ou@@ ghs and control of the f@@ ew@@ ashing bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice only is the last ref@@ usal of a party to find out from top to bottom without guidance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ NC @-@ Chair@@ person R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for d@@ oping scandal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a d@@ oping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said in the eve of the World Athletics Championships on the eve of athle@@ tics World Championships , that the ending of his country from the sport was correct and that he decided to fight d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes with gold and silver medals in competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining the ban in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) was found on government @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that Russian Federation must have experienced some kind of hot times , and everything possible to do to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accept the criteria for his re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think progress were made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to reg@@ ain Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ete from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the World Athletics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setup .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden train@@ ers are still working free , he said repe@@ ats in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral funeral for Mali lam@@ inated soldiers
some 1000 people of the two during a funeral celebration in the North American Frit@@ z@@ lar have thought about 1000 people at a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
to the un@@ explained crash , Defence Minister Ursula of the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
they described the two surro@@ unds pilots but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their expert . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday before a week in West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death force of the Bundes@@ wehr to the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .
at noon , only the relatives of the Church participated in the Church .
then the funeral celebration in the family of the family , closest friends , representatives of the army and politics .
among them also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
sad@@ ly laid ro@@ ses , the relatives stood in arm in the arms .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
Defense Minister from the Le@@ yen called the converted soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and disman@@ tled .
the Stab@@ sch@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the fighter helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regim@@ ent .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , the commander of the regim@@ ent , said : &quot; if this crew did not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali showed no doubt about the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , by which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried in his death by his death .
this shared the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish king &apos;s couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen was to agree with her husband &apos;s decision , it was on the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he is not int@@ ent to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a dog out of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the Thr@@ ash of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , he retired to reti@@ re , and also entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Jun@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not receive the title and function that he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by declared boss of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old was ultimately un@@ clear .
but he is not int@@ ent to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native @-@ born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ ese , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik , in his almost 50 years , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 years .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , sei@@ zu@@ res instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of soccer .
even for the Gau@@ ge , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco , and that the reputation had the reputation to be the mark of corporate critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for night .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two errors ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Premier Weil wants to re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP before the majority in Lower Saxony
expert &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is due to the loss of red @-@ green government shar@@ ehol@@ ding for a rapid new election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the Parliament spoke to the dis@@ solution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a Green Party in Lower Saxony had collapsed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the country code , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their scar@@ c@@ ely one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
El@@ ke T@@ life@@ has founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination of the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( deser@@ ts ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained in Hannover on Friday .
CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record them .
in this way , CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Dutch national day , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relation was inver@@ ted .
the new Land@@ tag is regularly elected on the 14th of January .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government had to decide whether it could continue to rule in this situation without majority .
however , Stephan Weil holds it to indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides to compl@@ ain his self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on further orders on Tuesday .
the national constitution also provides the possibility that the prime minister of the Prime Minister c@@ utt@@ eth trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
these options must be insp@@ ected legally , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all questions when they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ West &apos;s step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ sive . &quot;
the politicians himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very well . &quot;
she described himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the back@@ sliding of the parliamentary elections on the return of their country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course that they received their agricultural trade show , which has received over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed the president of a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the background that there was no content differences , we can &apos;t recre@@ ate this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD @-@ Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ coming of the European Green Party M@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ tors and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is supporting the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag .
the outlet T@@ we@@ ens is red @-@ green in Lower Saxony &apos;s majority .
the political scientist , &quot; in her past E@@ it@@ el@@ essness and in her fru@@ stration their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zing the SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus of salvation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ fusion game and tried to strike out political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
expert &apos;s CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his MPs to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CDU .
the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ jack@@ ets , with a personal career direct the result of the 2013 country code .
the CDU was the strongest force in the SPD at that time , but the SPD and Green had a very thin majority in the country .
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ vers , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can the consumers protect themselves .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Lord Schmidt , how can consumers protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers who just check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
on the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ goo@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states introduce the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all , we know what we are currently knowing a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
do Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs come out of the bid - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
despite this , my house has immediately been re@@ arranged , and it is since announcement of the afflicted in Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk evaluation are available to consumers .
trade has just like the manufacturers to worry , that the sold products are well @-@ able and harmless to health .
when the resi@@ due ratio of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not fit .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the local units are to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the actual knowledge , the production plants will not be immediate fault .
rather , they must reck@@ on due to mut@@ ually illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always , there is too little effort in the harvest .
is it missing only by the staff or on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls which have revealed the process .
however , the truth is also heard that food fraud and criminal energy can never be dis@@ bur@@ sed up to 100 percent .
therefore , a consistent education of such happening and hand@@ over to the coun@@ ties in the cases where crimes can be presented , of crucial importance .
I have already made some time clearly , that I expect from the responsible authorities to expect a mis@@ chi@@ less explanation .
is the regular alarm system really necessary in food scales ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively secure and market@@ able food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de in the food industry is used , consumers and consumers are entitled to right .
by the deliber@@ ated funds , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ xes is not acceptable in the attitude of life @-@ safe animals and must be immediately ended .
it has to be consistent on all levels and work with high pressure .
I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is grown up and tre@@ ach@@ able .
how the financial rules of the football player on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent enormous expendi@@ tures of European foot@@ ball@@ ers will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA yet , for the leading organisation that the European game supervised the power to prohi@@ bit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched by the UEFA in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G has to point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without any major losses .
Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( $ 262 million ) in order to buy the Brazilian market from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G may make the money loose with certainty so N@@ ey@@ mar writes and put it into a galaxy of other stars , considering the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to contribute to legitimate income sources , which enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
he was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations , who had taken tremendous debts in their quest to success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ked to ru@@ in when banks or owner moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P from concentration on the liabilities of the club rely on monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ mo@@ vich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - had a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the crew and build a global mark - becoming a tough@@ er matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FF@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidency in the Un@@ gn@@ ade , UEFA &apos;s successor continues Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in to ensure excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount paid for the invoice over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , allowing for the next five years amounting to € 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( back then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million , and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to over@@ list their financial vision by connecting their income by companies that are associated with owners of a club .
while a Hungarian company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of the sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not be considered legitimate income .
it was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of PSA by Qatar Tourism Authority was pu@@ ffed up by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments in N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar over payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have fought that N@@ ey@@ mar WM am@@ bass@@ adors will be to be an ambassador for the UEFA Reg@@ ulations authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA will be more attentive to consider each attempt to b@@ ypass the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke of the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not committed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated revenues of € 54@@ 2.4 million with a turnover of more than € 10 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot .
the club assumes that revenue after the signature is at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was definitely ir@@ ri@@ fied , one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by saying that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Kat@@ ars last owner to PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations from La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of the ball over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country owns an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial fair , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major actor in order to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new ch@@ og@@ gi@@ ate supplier
in recent years , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y board has made chocolate for Swiss .
the association is now facing a possible end : the airline writes the mission new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request by the news agency S@@ DA to a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west schwei@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will close a new contract during the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; she said the spokes@@ woman .
around 17 million small rot@@ ated chocolate panels at 14 grams are distributed each year before landing at passengers .
Swiss did not want to make any information about the cost .
industry insi@@ der estimate the order volume according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros subsidiary is achieved annual sales of about one billion Swiss francs .
but more import@@ antly , the advertising effect : for a barrier producer it is a prestigious order .
how many Can@@ did@@ ates exist in the new call , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y Swiss .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y will ende@@ av@@ our to make a renewal of the Treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .
for S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for an opinion .
chocolate bars spread the Swiss Life on board their flights since 2006 .
before Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has been built in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss began two and a half years with the start of collaboration with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers .
clients of the First Class are p@@ am@@ pered with treats of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi von Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y in the business Class n@@ ags von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi .

the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost its ma@@ i@@ bility .
and there is another crazy @-@ malign@@ ant plot , included in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) that is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as usual , the courses are the best part of the franchise .
it makes particularly good fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ illons Mal@@ li@@ ppen@@ che from &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is looking to feel like an old dum@@ b .
it &apos;s the moments of random mad@@ ness that could start this franchise , like a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches this what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang from &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
in the meantime , &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is reminis@@ cent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with East @-@ West Ring@@ ed I@@ kon@@ ography .
the comedy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created a comedy by R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director , a Romanian drama of eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main tro@@ ut - a hard @-@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ el@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a comprehensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice gig to look at ( the police force the time to watch chess on television as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ af Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - cares for an decent match &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama . a mur@@ derer who carries a Reagan mask is included - that it is often like a single one .
with six long episodes , it attracts attention , and the comedy is not fast , or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was placed on a less@@ er length , could visit his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p Sati@@ re better because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef once again occupied the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick males .
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that western culture can do everything for food .
the fic@@ tive Romanian creator weren &apos;t wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with them .
impact on Drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police have a blow against the Italian m@@ afia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , a couple of objects in the Black Forest , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart were searched for numerous objects such as the prosecutor &apos;s public prosecutor .
15 years were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 . arrest war@@ rants had already been issued against this alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the officials appointed larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same time Raz@@ cia in Italy two persons were arrested .
on the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans were issued on German arrest war@@ rants .
these two are therefore likely to be shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the members of the Mafia is accused of drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 the public prosecutor &apos;s public prosecutor has been determined against organised drug traff@@ icking in the South German space .
between the territory in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contacts with their colleagues in Sicily .
so the big deployment on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the Vis@@ ier of the investigations , mainly Italian citizens with respect to the Italian m@@ afia .
a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen as well as several shots were fired in the morning at the early morning , could go to the bond &apos;s account .
ways compl@@ ains large g@@ aps in foreigners register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who shouldn &apos;t appear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report the foreig@@ ner register shows significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly engraved mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
the Federal Government &apos;s representative for refugee management in the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made a media report atten@@ tively to large g@@ aps in the field @-@ country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings of the data registered data could lead to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in an analysis that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the register , ten million people with foreign citizens are collected , including 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are thus managed by about 600 foreign agencies in Germany .
because the data were not sufficiently maintained , data quality in parts have not been good enough so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are data from 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who have long been no longer in life , or citizens who have become a German citizen , and in the register &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are not able to emerge in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ correct dat@@ ors were able to slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on foreign people , the EU citizens are covered , who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such false assign@@ ments were , however , &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with exclusion . &quot; therefore , it is said in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government began to rec@@ ap@@ point refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy if they have traveled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this go out from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it is said that B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures for families with children - except for infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically not possible anymore , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant ship travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the arrival of the trav@@ eland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason the office is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recording capacity for families with younger children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have delivered for recording and accommodation from Famili@@ es .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold this commitment to sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokesperson for the government in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening due to lack of acceptance in Italian asylum system and a endanger@@ ment of child poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result obtained
a total of 220 liters of blood in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already ordered the blood donation to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens , which were excellent on Friday .
in all , Jürgen Gre@@ ens , who had now 100 liters of blood , has now distributed 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the Municipal Council comm@@ ends the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our body is created and we p@@ ollen the don@@ ors respect to provide their blood for foreigners , still un@@ conventional , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the power supply manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger corn enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents .
thus , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported the actions that will be carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K circul@@ ator manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently the change to the theatre was led in a few years ago to higher participants .
before before Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Schö@@ ck , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le , and Meta Um@@ ber to the multi @-@ multi@@ ples and were awarded for each 50 years .

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later , that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation would damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; when they continued interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened pressure .
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) voted to maintain interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby in this month less members em@@ bal@@ med a rise , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that pressure on household income would continue , although inflation is likely to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , Zin@@ ser@@ vi@@ ations would be necessary to ch@@ urch@@ ase the inflation of Bre@@ xit more than expected to go over to the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mamm@@ ut stimul@@ us package that was published a year after Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will require time for financing the financial plan to provide cheap financial aid for banks in order to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of M@@ PC , the GDP will remain weak ( GDP ) short @-@ term , because pressure on real households will continue to reduce consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the rates of interest they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain amount of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to cooling down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets are expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank however emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s revised growth forecasts for this and next year will rise to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the next year .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages by the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures have been reduced to increasing expectations and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected in the third quarter at 0.3 % , although it is likely to recover from the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by increasing inflation and mar@@ gin@@ alised sal@@ aries , because the sharp@@ ening becomes even worse before they will improve then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years could not prevent the income quar@@ ry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of her three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate for a part of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ dus .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
before the last decision of interest in interest rates , the call increased after a interest rate because inflation increased the pressure on hard pressed households with three political decision makers in July caused a rise to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has decreased from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that over@@ flows in relation to their goal of 2 % would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ t , director of Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive again because the len@@ ders are looking forward to shops and end the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly well for those in which the existing De@@ als run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages include , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should prop@@ el HIV drug 10,000 people
in September after a fight against the drug in N@@ HS , patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV prevalence treatment in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual intercourse recorded pre@@ position di@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risk of high risk patients by around 86 percent , now being delivered by the health service on a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he was willing to finance the process after the Court of Appe@@ als in the last year confirmed the ruling of the Supreme Court ruling that N@@ HS had to pay the findings in spite of the claim that local authorities should finance him .
the Chess campaign announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in England in April 2018 .
Pre@@ extern@@ ally sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP was significantly reduced to HIV transmission in Inf@@ ection .
Pr@@ ison before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .
for those who come to question include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified primarily by the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not familiar with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered with a doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexu@@ al@@ clinic .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medication in this week after an international competitive collection .
the study is expected to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by being collected and implemented in a large scale , as it is implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention was to gain far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and over@@ take .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in managing one of humanity &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted towards needy and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September to people people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be accomplished that the study is quickly held throughout the country and that no one , who has left an risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the Pr@@ EP @-@ test medicine was pro@@ cured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the Pre@@ EP @-@ process is welcome after months of delay and delay , due to the government and over@@ due . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection can end .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they contribute to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I lived with my ex @-@ Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ anne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed and over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
originally a one @-@ room property with a covered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne reservoir and a mezzanine to best use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home , not just a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms in each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking to solve the awar@@ es .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were cra@@ mmed in each other without hes@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not only that a simple platform to build , but to put the steel so that he had the right height above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with an additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light windows of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down via the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
a mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents , and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting place the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatres , space and light .
on both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to allow him to work longer .
in the kitchen the reflection feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , pi@@ red units offer space for all the bri@@ bes and glasses by Jo@@ anne .
by the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of steel @-@ reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ ated MDF @-@ Do@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that if you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate agents will enter and carry out a calculation based on floor size . &quot;
here they made it to enlarge and use high @-@ quality materials to use the space its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and that are therefore helping to create emotional ties in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you do not forget to electrical plug sockets in the walls .
they are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a slightly standard design and increased square met@@ eor , which can be transformed into something completely unusual .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them not .
brothers fighting for a 500 million US Dollar bill
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate empire in the worth of over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors of his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confron@@ tation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 properties in worth more than half a billion dollars , collected since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , bought .
the West@@ co je@@ ans family established there and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in town @-@ rum , development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ men and shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Colin - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; was described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the business year and Paul approximately one @-@ third .
a jurisdiction says that Colin &apos;s property has valued at a value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth $ 176 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved for Paul as a professional point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colin proposed convic@@ tions have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in the first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , the first hearing at the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday .
the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - which Colin , as Paul claiming that it was excluded .
Colin argued that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent .
in an early affair that was submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case with hundreds of sites with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the Bar .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants that operated dairy bars and delic@@ ac@@ ies of the late 1950 @-@ s and in the early 1970s a shop in Bruns@@ wick bought .
they used the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Li@@ egen@@ schafts@@ betrieb , in which Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
Colin says he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hopes to pass their property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis company group , but Colin claims that Mark was paid by the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
either Luke and Mark , Paul says , &quot; talked about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin rejected himself very well , although he was a former AF@@ L board member , and after a biography of Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took in touch with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t really say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me , and put our family name through the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not desire that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he was still waiting for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
m@@ umps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have attempted and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
pol@@ tico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a steady course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ters Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , commented on his first day of working with senior employees , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wants to repair : bad information taken into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would get better choices if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnos@@ ing makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by watching his meditation .
President Tr@@ umps related to television for decades - and now , where he &apos;s in the White House , his television is still strong .
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs , &quot; said the former prime minister of Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite a poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ umps Twitter habits are under control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps has ever been &quot; under control , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ umps Twe@@ ets without their interventions would have even more spark plugs .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets , which has not sent Tr@@ ump .
when his staff already made it a few times , trouble the trouble of him , their efforts paid off .
but nobody else has to prevent Tr@@ ump controversy .
a part of the problem exists that people in a White House , which are composed of competing parties , are always trying to present their own agenda by promoting dr@@ ump material which may potentially support their views from the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors to dou@@ bt@@ ful information on the pre@@ ference for strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example of being described by repor@@ ters Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former p@@ umping officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press lines , especially those with con@@ di@@ gest@@ ing le@@ aks , and that he will find out to find out where these come from .
exactly that happened at the end of February , when somebody accused the president of malign@@ ant a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of being at the White House .
although Johnson was banned from Twitter or that he has been offered no specific evidence , or that he expresses false evidence in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tries to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to prove more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors still stri@@ ve to influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make the Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Mei@@ y@@ requested crimin@@ als receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the people will pray and hoped .
the police assembled throughout Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards of dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the memory crimin@@ als are not known in accordance with the population , notes from the population will be hoped and pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion , which follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences showed that many fle@@ eting to travel destinations hide , called it by Euro@@ pol .
we have compiled 21 postcards for requested crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ers , has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online search could have been arrested , at least eleven of which are due to publication based on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ating over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some de@@ but@@ ted trav@@ ellers on the foot of war , which have acted one out of the mun@@ itions left by the church in order to rec@@ la@@ im a field before their man@@ sions .
the trav@@ eler have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside of a weal@@ thy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports , after they were forced out in May without being deported by the Council of excav@@ ated gra@@ bs , to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section , which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
angry residents drew the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous owner said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to the Bentley Heath , where they threw a stone on the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced by shame to the implementation , since it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the travelers were there in May , were moved and are now back .
more happened yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to circum@@ navigate , by taking long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live at Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my group &apos;s dest@@ iny when the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
an natives that would not be called , said : &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this trav@@ eler , only to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the figures have increased this time and one even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of a dirt camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our scholarship collection , it is very important that as many local residents are to report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior during the police , calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to prove when we advance in the case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is now renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
they are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambi@@ ence of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then ambi@@ ence of the company mbH , on April 13th , 2014 , some 30,000 nights were lost each year and also revenues from the local fee .
in autumn 2014 , given dramatic increase of numbers of refugees who came into the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed in the community at that time .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Ober@@ bürger@@ meister Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of re@@ mn@@ ant interested in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director , Birgit Sch@@ erer , headquartered in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter monastery .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s al@@ b .
hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have a long time building container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive reconstruction works are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to be disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer talking with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Dance style .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input area is transformed , there will be new windows installed .
everything should later be &quot; beautiful , &quot; when Thomas Sch@@ erer goes out .
&quot; we want to make a je@@ wel . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
you don &apos;t want to position on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher downtown level , Sch@@ erer is empha@@ sized .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would be wide and explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business people are supposed to feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already led his talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Krau@@ se .
the performances of the city are covered with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
following the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to define it exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outer comple@@ xes are also transported to fore@@ man , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant that is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. special judges to Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s affairs around US President Donald Tr@@ ump is alleged to have made a special Grand Jury report by Robert Mu@@ eller after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel has recorded work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to the business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper praised the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the station CNN reported that there are already first charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , targeted in the presidential elections in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether they were talking between tr@@ umps campaigns team and Moscow .
in the investigation of the investigations , several men are supposed to participate in the election campaign as consultants of the Republi@@ cans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also increased more and more m@@ umps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a couple of weeks ago that the Special City Tr@@ ump personally touched the center and seek the accus@@ ation whether the president is perhaps disabled the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide if the charges shall be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called the purchase chambers .
mostly they are switched on , if there are larger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to charge people in relation to E@@ id .
according to the channel CNN , demonstrations have already been issued to turn the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ umps were also consultants and mother @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ aging campaign director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort on his conversation .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the one show that Mu@@ eller should not leave itself in his work , and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the suspension of the committee on the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday night used a speech in West Virginia to represent Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic give the Democrats a way to feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about that they can talk . &quot;
his special advis@@ ers T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion that he is ignor@@ ant of a Grand Jury .
but this also works usually in the ear , he stressed .
the White House for@@ ci@@ fies any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent on &quot; fair . &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times , that not against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this R@@ ump accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he had hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to make an investigation of the investigations against the former national security adviser Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after a presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special en@@ quiries and its employees .
that dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether tr@@ ump mu@@ eller is fired .
unlike an independent special interest of the Congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , in order to re@@ lie@@ ve the President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller said a position in which he could be fired on the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republican and democratic sen@@ ators , on Thursday , were reli@@ eved on Thursday , after which the Special City could no longer be released .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the Western Antar@@ c@@ tica , a gigantic ice@@ berg of the nearly seven @-@ fold Berlin Berlin@@ s are solved .
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the giant f@@ lowed over a trillion metric tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres of large colon@@ ists now drive to the north and will probably take two or three years until it melted .
it is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice @-@ ants who have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in the break@@ age of the ice , is un@@ clear according to research .
in total , there has been a series of unusual co@@ ag@@ arri@@ es in the region around 30 years in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in an fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
so far , the col@@ ander was a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ong@@ s .
sm@@ el@@ bows swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aciers .
it is still growing into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this fe@@ el@@ ight was the balance of wa@@ xes and dis@@ rup@@ ting some years ago .
a full swing will be tra@@ ced there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ sh@@ el@@ hen &apos;s Lar@@ sen was in danger , because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and could crum@@ ble , if there is a piece of scra@@ p on a key .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and I@@ ce@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water and ice so much water , as it is done after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the bill leads to the gl@@ aciers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level , but only in a small degree , the British research project writes on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI @-@ informations with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ largest bell @-@ cra@@ ck@@ ling of Antar@@ c@@ tica .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural happening and not direct connection to climate change , the ice plate now comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; that &apos;s the wid@@ est withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists , it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C loop will grow back again , and possibly fall together , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this trend will take decades .
even though this researcher break the break of this gigantic ice age not on climate change , so in the past few decades the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have collapsed .
this long walk of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature increase has contributed .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have passed around three degrees in the past 50 years , so that the temperature at the fastest increases in which the temperature is fastest .
CDU wants a front @-@ rate at the staff
because it becomes more difficult to fill @-@ out places , the CDU , from the employers association , calls for more attractive to become more attractive .
just shortly before the summer break , the chal@@ k &apos;s Day has aver@@ ted 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the management administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind .
the apprentices in the circle are apparently very desi@@ rable .
around 620 of the applications were to be listed for this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still lacking personnel to tackle the A@@ sc@@ ended requirements and tasks .
at the moment there are some 50 non @-@ occupied positions at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers are looking for general administration .
the CDU wants to join the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG running the initiative and meeting skilled professionals in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is intended to work as a concept for identity and recruitment development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demands of skilled workers but future @-@ oriented of application short@@ age .
the overall concept should be orient@@ ated within and extern@@ ally orient@@ ate concrete measures for cross @-@ level operators and include a training offensive , call for CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds even after a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which you did not know sooner .
other cities are good servants and employees , offering more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease or age caused by the ministry .
so su@@ preme time for action so that it would not remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter races , president of the CDU , and the leader of the CDU , continues with his party .
he had long been in@@ scri@@ bed in the delivery day for a fine , surprise when he put the public parking coverage in the public and start@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want to check out that all possibilities will be checked , which enable an exit from the municipal employers association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come in the short term to a satisfactory solution , the round@@ about should aim with the trade unions - perhaps in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hu@@ stle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the CDU , employees and officials are trying to pay better , as it actually fore@@ sees the rate of tari@@ ffs for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently being prescribed , increases or more money only if you are changing in a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have been growing ever more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be established , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone of NGO &apos;s migrants rescue boat
in Italy , NGOs , the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue to continue their new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs have not signed a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said interior minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came a day after Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat to the German aid organisation &apos; adolesc@@ ence &apos; because their team worked effectively with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that lighten@@ ed illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation only since one year , refused to express itself as a detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian government Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we can not operate in search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all the accus@@ ations which are currently collected , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ather &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is believed that its crew members take place on board ships , which can be delivered directly to men &apos;s vend@@ ors , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the law of the prosecutor , whose contents of Italian media was published .
the occupation is suspected of susp@@ ending on the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the lif@@ egu@@ ards in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must be aboard a Italian police officers , who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been ready to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter spoke on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , since they would not have &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; of their rescue actions .
among the ones who refuse to sign is Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate Organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy in the last weeks had strongly declined , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libya &apos;s Coast Guard and the cooperation with local side@@ walks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tun@@ nels , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left these countries in hope to reach Europe .
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berliner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in the North pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and sights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley turned out to be a good base for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ ress and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour went on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed look@@ out spots , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre@@ valent planes .
in between , there were repeatedly longer att@@ achments , for the long tri@@ b@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ market .
again , look@@ out spot on look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate stro@@ kes .
on the last two days , many al@@ timeter were already said .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and mar@@ riages made welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ ker held a healing in the open @-@ air content in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporting and cul@@ turally speaking .
console instead of grass - Bundesliga gl@@ ands for e @-@ sport
does the Sport @-@ stars sit in front of computer consol@@ es , instead of swe@@ ating in wind and weather about the stadium bubbles ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages inclusive .
they also recognize the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ an , that increasingly engage themselves in this area .
the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which started an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Bureau Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
he is certain , &quot; that on this train some clubs are still rising . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organized FIFA &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the gam@@ er can compete in different clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified .
Robin D@@ utt is also great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now offering a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football team has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people go into the stadium even in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , one could be present far more often in these markets than just once a year to send the Federal Republic to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
when the e @-@ sport will play computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the FIFA simulation of FIFA at the competition .
long ago , as in the normal sport , Li@@ gen was established , in which the pros can compete against each other .
and in the Asian region , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a proper sport ?
for many , the idea is absolutely necessary .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ atic has also been dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because he is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions , which one also find in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress response , hormon@@ al changes .
I also need cog@@ nitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; the itte Player is a good player . &quot;
f@@ rob@@ atic now sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more a topic . &quot;
controls are hard to be tra@@ ce@@ able in online games , and in the scene failed the structures of classical sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively , the scientist raises the high @-@ inclusive effect of E @-@ Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players are on the way international , which is like a great global family , since there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association &apos;s Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport ahead of fast growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .

Michelle Carter , because of the texts , put Conrad Roy to suicide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encour@@ ages her boy@@ friend and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years have been abandoned .
on 13 July 2014 , Carter was sentenced to life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free .
it was confron@@ ted with a maximum of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a psych@@ ic illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a creamy bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down@@ wards eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the public pro@@ secut@@ ors to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she has not taken over responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ rier &apos;s lawyer said that it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they are completely un@@ fortun@@ ate . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he didn &apos;t find out that her &quot; age or Rei@@ g@@ eg@@ rad or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a Prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day that I would not enter the loss of my beloved son .
I would like to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will bear for eternity with us , for his sisters there , &quot; says it in it .
Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never be persecuted by the knowledge that she would never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother , or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this only person to have been together with whom I &apos;ve been together since my birth , is a pain that I will keep my life for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to place a right preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime that makes it a crime committed suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case moved to national attention after Car@@ ters text@@ books revealed that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; join you up , spring from a building , I do not know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent to his death in the two weeks before his death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the eyes of his hom@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything that you must do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter found attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few that Carter defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted of murder on her British fel@@ low@@ lives in Italy in 2007 , was acquitted before she was acquitted two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment on Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua had allowed me to go to the Audi Cup as captain , no coincidence .
the FC Bayern looked at the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm .
what was different from his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra piece was very small , very small .
but since far and broad@@ ly on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups there was no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and neither Manuel New : he made himself the hur@@ ried Bin@@ de simply to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the level could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also suggest Kim@@ me .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was not one of the eight years old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal , who had been chosen as a game leader in youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and straight from the holiday .
you would like to be able to give sugar to those who want to hold a lot , you want to keep in mood .
so if you have chosen the inheritance from L@@ ah@@ m , you can only use a small extra motivation .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to do : responsibility to take over responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old heated over the field .
at the right behind , that &apos;s his position , the white bin@@ ds in the arm did the rest .
and at all , Kim@@ me found myself in this starting formation as the one that the Ru@@ der can take the best into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had a look at the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal making his missing fitness to play ( fol@@ ate hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on the devil , come out on the performance of the Asia trip ( as well as only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as sweet to fall in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
all this was fol@@ ly .
in addition to Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y ran in front of the ri@@ f@@ le , both ag@@ itated effort@@ lessly .
the nam@@ ing Nap@@ oli @-@ storm is often extremely difficult , in addition , sweet@@ le tried again in the play @-@ building a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y gave the fact that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also he showed an ordinary performance at the debut .
playing cards , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
as usual , this Bavaria @-@ world was still standing for new operations , one looked to the game .
for instance , Rud@@ y gave no one or two or two or seven interviews in Kat@@ ak@@ om@@ bs , for example .
Kim@@ me said after a few cris@@ p statements on his new recording .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting phrase there : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Bavaria you just need to win any game . &quot;
nevertheless he does not have to teach the New anymore .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate ministers : business pra@@ ises knowledge pace
it often proved un@@ promis@@ ingly , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , still economic minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and ad@@ missions at the same time the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ er Enterprise ( V@@ TU ) says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke all blocked them . &quot;
the biggest swe@@ eping face sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ en@@ sion of the Highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the priority list of the country now .
this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure , until 2021 should be right .
the country &apos;s role in the country &apos;s plans are also reflected in the country &apos;s v@@ ord@@ inal demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to take the route in December 2020 , says Minister of Foreign Affairs Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally un@@ competing enterprises .
the industrial and industry of commerce ( I@@ HK ) , Trier , aims to increase the production of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label , in order to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing also has an open ear for people who want to establish a company , the I@@ HK pra@@ ises .
in the new master bonus , the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional inc@@ entive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
it is intended to make a premium of € 1000 for the comp@@ uted master examination and 2500 Euro if graduates within ten years after the master education is self @-@ constantly .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned road construction are quick facts to create , at the same time , according to the necessary personnel , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer says the main business leader of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers , you want to adjust the Wis@@ dom in the country operation , only 29 positions have been occupied .
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to external offices .
in the CDU faction , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the host country , the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of state roads as proposed by 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to fix the lack of skilled professionals in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the previous broadband construction in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in a I@@ HK survey ( note 3,4 ) .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ding Internet connections and abor@@ tions .
ex @-@ economic minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left the Green Party in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they already cleared out the field after four months of dis@@ agreements .
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confron@@ ted with a counter reaction
a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in over 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW leader said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving limits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to be sold or limit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance with regulations for carbon emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are regarded as carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to install exhaust gases , also take what it is difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful automobile companies and signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switching devices that could regulate emissions if a car was tested , but back at normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former leader of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany &apos;s motor development .
former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected by extradition and could be placed in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi , to b@@ ypass the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could have been heavily polluted : the luxury car manufacturer is proportional to the gain of Volkswagen .

mor@@ dil@@ los b@@ oll@@ es and the laugh at the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most published Carto@@ on Dra@@ fts@@ man , the Kn@@ oll@@ ards of his figures are his trademark .
with 85 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean still stands and works in a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he hit himself as a character for greetings cards - which was fru@@ str@@ ated by him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the 1960s , he achieved his breakthrough : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artist , inspired by the cities again .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo , cav@@ orting in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
on the early morning he is sitting according to his own data , even today , almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches are still finding a lot of distribution throughout the world .
he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los of a popular animal in his drawings - that has a thou@@ si@@ le as a def@@ ender .
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is scheduled to arrive in 2019 at the Kin@@ ol@@ ein@@ wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying , it is strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore , he sets out more on the TV series , which is produced , like its original drawings , wor@@ t@@ less .
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the Lav@@ ender is remin@@ ded of the conditions and because of the diseases transmitted insects backward , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effective , because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years , and in fall much more .
this has imp@@ lications for the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf zi@@ k@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
lav@@ ender oil does not only stand for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than long plants with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either weak@@ ened or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered considered are a better water distribution and slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration out of the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce will usually take wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what will feel safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the goal of a attack with gren@@ ades , or to leave them at home .
security experts have three words written on a board at the front of the room : ad@@ versaries , Neut@@ ral , allies .
they ask repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , per@@ cep@@ tions and stomach feelings .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being suspected of standing by the government , or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make chaos dangerous by Mexico .
there are no resting periods of violence , and throughout the country the bodies are frequent , more and more journalists have taken place : at least 25 , since President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto held its position in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are after the attacks and threats of federal government and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries .
among the latter is her publisher and her in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake it is to be living in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply felt , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , that shows his middle finger on the front of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ ah@@ em .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a prob@@ ands of the Federal Pro@@ secution were built in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , this was only led by the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murders , which are linked to drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed on trial .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they are still looking to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a while they are in@@ tr@@ in@@ ous and although the terrain is still dig@@ ni@@ ated .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting of the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so long as we don &apos;t know the Why we are afraid of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was shot out of his car and sentenced to him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelve River . &quot;
the shooter drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but about Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and the surrender in the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a to become one of the most bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
there is nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the road or that the grav@@ ey@@ ard is full of consuming , two @-@ story Maus@@ oleum for drug Royal , which are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes two mis@@ understanding has contributed to the murder .
in February , the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lopez , a leader of one of the rival map fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the children , susp@@ icious ga@@ it bought each copy of the output as soon as she was shipped to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez not to force Val@@ dez , after the capture of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country to its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he served as experienced repor@@ ters for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without pushing the noise of the d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
at the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and the turnover and advertising took place .
repor@@ ters loved it , hard tre@@ ading investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were intri@@ gu@@ ed by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria - Mo@@ ors &quot; Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for its reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican drugs history , wherever they did .
he voluntarily gave himself that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task of giving you a journalist - either it or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to ask : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do with such a lot ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird @-@ bird , who could fly like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and ratings , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted on his routine .
he always would carry his hat .
he always would go to El Guay@@ ama , the bar towards the office , and there always will be sitting at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine to his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death too has forced them to ask their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work on the best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it , if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret start and landing ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ care and self @-@ keeping .
his own inst@@ inc@@ ts trust .
when it sm@@ ells wrong , just stay away .
the anger , said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier happened . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ rou@@ tes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no cell phones were allowed . days earlier became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in the outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an area .
half in scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who were the governor himself as not trusted .
it is months ago since the reporter went into the mountain landscape , where the drug abuse are under control .
for this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce passed on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending which concentrated on the home town of the Governor .
and there was a group called in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Office C@@ ep@@ ort , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who has been kidnapped or as it happened , so be careful when everyone in the city knows what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug dealers and authorities .
a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling In@@ stitutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost all political levels throughout the century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption cases of corruption .
in fact , Vill@@ ar@@ real asked repor@@ ters to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , among them one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went into a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers used the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body keyboard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers who prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists because the employees had become something that she never expected : activists in the name of the press .
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ult disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the Western State of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists have become more lou@@ der throughout the country by making them in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on Geh@@ rig and Construction .
on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone out in Washington and tried to collect international support for the justice in Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and kill them because they have said the truth .
she has therefore asked that she is again devi@@ ded by the government because she is concerned that their rage has viol@@ ated its objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , taking part in government officials and a Gender Equality . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug abuse , but also on orders of politicians and security forces which were using organised crime under a ceiling .
last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; took part in more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , you die , because you want to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the kill@@ ings have a terrible effect .
no one forget the death of the Blo@@ g@@ inist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was signed by the etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones besides their se@@ per@@ ated head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dents MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug card with an editorial office in front of the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their homeland , or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , the 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay returning and continuing work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , indicates that the drug traff@@ icking was troubled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became reporter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was sitting on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and drinking beer , than once all their teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ s up .
a series of shooting vessels with band@@ ages and security forces near the swimming pool of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
she has published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on the mobile web site .
the front page had to be updated on the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ els close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who held guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid of all , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the folded founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day , when Javier was murdered , the intern@@ ship asked me to send them to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ oufl@@ age to retreat his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue once a terri@@ fying .
now researchers found out that the first insight of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even notice that his gro@@ wer &apos;s skin was brown - and they said they had had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report published in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preserved dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has ever been found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered Art of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ kept state has researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic is the bre@@ wed plant bre@@ e@@ aters the best preserved fossil its kind .
it was found by Shawn Radio when he was dug in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
he met on something that appeared on the plateau , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth pump .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only blind with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creation is seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Dinosau@@ rs pieces - Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found out that this plant e@@ aters , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably threatened by carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs .
the heavily damaged dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ oufl@@ age to hide itself from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to mix well into its surroundings and retreat to his enemies , experts say what was threatened by greater dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one from a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to exp@@ ose it carefully .
the amazing conservation of copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the confron@@ tation , a common defence method in the animal rich , meaning that the head of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the eligi@@ bility is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals survi@@ ving today .
it suggests that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , hun@@ ted by the evolution of confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who use the sha@@ dy sha@@ ding - think of deer , Zeb@@ ras or belts - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey , what signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real battle for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , strong ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs dat@@ ors have been of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales are also showing that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal on his life , including he &apos;s fourth performances , to find out what it was eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river and driven into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .
at that time Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with contra@@ sting skin , but remains in three dimensions and re@@ tains the original form of the beast , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal still looks like in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ design it . if you are only a little with the eyes clos@@ ers , you could almost believe that he is at sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when gigantic thermal periods , carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the Earth went through .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the pan@@ de@@ fied dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus one 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , their latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been sank after the death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Shawn Radio when he was dug in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum it is the preserved dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hips .
the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es which ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant e@@ aters has been shi@@ fted through Western Canada until a flooded stream in the open sea .
but the underwater control of the dinosau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquis@@ itely detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the hood always covers b@@ ump@@ y tank plates along the dinosau@@ rs .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ vation is as rare as a profit in lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the confused it becomes .
clo@@ aked remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates that wear the skull of the beast .
his right front foot is on its side , his five fingers crossed over .
I can count the sheds on its sole .
in the th@@ under@@ storm : massage am@@ bol@@ age to A8 : many injured persons
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a massage lock@@ out .
there are numerous injuries , kilometres long , and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , some 20 people have been injured during the late Thursday afternoon .
after the first data of the police there were against 17.00 between the connection places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Landkreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm . nearly 30 vehicles , including trucks , trucks .
there is no information about the exact number of injuries at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was critical for light to moderate injuries , a police officer said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre retreat was formed .
as an AZ reporter reports , it also occurred on the counter @-@ track to massive disabilities - by numerous guns .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ched the mark of vehicle watches , which now have to calculate with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock there was another second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was too a coll@@ ision between a car ran@@ sport@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced once : nothing remin@@ ding you in the train and sleeps .
or one is ver@@ ti@@ led in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ ered .
the Schaff@@ ner comes and w@@ akes a uns@@ hi@@ ft or ri@@ ps the driving direction in the middle of the work@@ flow .
driving control .
but the times of breaks are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tested the most @-@ made driving control .
one is confirmed by mobile phone that is taken in its place and evalu@@ ates the map .
currently , a test mode runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer we are far off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected to be available in many other remote locations in Germany at the beginning of the year , &quot; said a train speaker .
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train ticket price without Schaff@@ ner .
to use this , however , some pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator &apos;s app , which is the most convenient type of the ticket booking .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works : you get up in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
with the test accounts , a button to the electronic de@@ stand@@ ings appears .
the train conductor get a message to their mobile devices a message that Pass@@ enger X is located in the train and taken the booked seat Y .
comes the train conductor at the speed@@ card control at No. Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ fied online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to relax without a ticket control by our train companion , check out in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables the passengers to make your travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing executive board of DB remote traffic .
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
those often de@@ parts , knows that in addition to delay and missed trains , the ticket checks are among the largest off@@ ences .
because often , in any case , one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to get into the exploitation of online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card is either missing , or a document that is required .
the result are endless discussions between train direc@@ torate and driving direction , which leads to bad mood in part or large space and del@@ ays in control of their own tickets and take the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked .
as an activist came to study the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to their core .
just one day after she had arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment which rented and sc@@ roll through fac@@ ebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled upon a post of someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it still lies on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused when nobody posted on their feed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly praying at its tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , stretched out on the street and stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing for them and their community nothing new .
she made her cell phone to return later on the evening to Twe@@ ets of people on Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , the scre@@ amed , and by a man who claimed to be a Brow@@ ns father , who carried a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , she said , assured another polic@@ eman , his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have used to call ourselves and we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she got her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinemas from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell ran with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had lots of times in front of this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed an 18 year old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take it , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be re@@ ared .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is to free to free us .
even if I have the luck to give you an experience in which she has not experienced a de@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not unlike the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would have a bad service to hold them away from it . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ ground as activists on the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson waited .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business partner , who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped them to pass prot@@ esters .
slowly , a new species of activ@@ ism began to accept form for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black con@@ greg@@ ations .
&quot; I had no experience in the organisation .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this scep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless cases of people , often from white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We &apos;ve heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , a artist from the area that is known for its activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct Insul@@ ations .
his commitment brought to Fer@@ rell the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we talk , &quot; Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are presented , because I &apos;ll be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ re@@ lls - to show that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not about a Messiah leaders , but to a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participants of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ lls how she loves and marry her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be a certain degree in this work and in the realization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ lls is repe@@ ating the role of black gay men in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have influenced the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried out the movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are fighting for different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women have to carry the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; follow Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is no affir@@ m@@ matic type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no coincidence , although she was in front of the front , because in a life at this cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the municipality and the police have still continued .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway with a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area they called her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
however , she cl@@ amped on a singing and she feels committed to this memory ever since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; Meg@@ al@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss over Bit Gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves people , although they are not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the Sü@@ ver of the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ ct since the first presentation in 2009 , the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
the theme is hardly any cold .
the theme is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while they say a bit of the bit @-@ gallery , &quot; This would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real @-@ class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ose ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery has more customers in the city , which also benefit from the rest of the business , the ad@@ versaries fear that then the pedestrian zone ble@@ eds .
the gallery will be added : the gallery will offer exactly on the grounds on which the farmers market stands , offering 13 direct marketing products .
at the beginning of the construction work will conclude .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Bed@@ a place with possibility to sit outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been selling almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the country women always happy again .
we have discovered the but@@ chers of but@@ chers .
we would like that during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there are also .
the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing can be posted in a market hall in the gallery , comes at the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this should probably not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what are your shopping venues in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you see how many stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekend market , it is more important that the market hall will remain at least .
for all , the goods offered are fresh , mostly offered by the producer and is ob@@ end@@ able .
as you see , shop stores are rented in a shopping center only from larger firms because the dor@@ ous r@@ ents are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special transactions are almost no longer and what is left , will then disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit me together .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market place during building time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA is the solution - even in duration when the bit @-@ gallery has actually come out .
or does it already create a bit @-@ bit @-@ gallery before , to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will just not work .
and a shopping center that is empty , nobody needs .
according to my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market , rather than this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant market , it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - how I find - sensu@@ al construction projects in bit@@ burg no more space .
when the Pe@@ asant Taver@@ n is made , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , almost un@@ wei@@ ght@@ ful - which hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 Por@@ traits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen Tu@@ pipes and hair@@ cut sections , which were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analyst dem@@ on a 35 @-@ year sentence after she had publicly initiated diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is a Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline had their expertise in technology , computer sciences , and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and sign@@ alling dis@@ si@@ der@@ ation , whose sentence had been transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which could look up from the 30 portraits , such as someone can look like with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many wise men as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Bradley Edward , but has been talking openly about the identification as woman , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the spy law , computer and theft .
by the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so very that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , where Mann@@ ing sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ in@@ blonde hair - with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 @-@ Project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
therein , the artist portraits of strangers made from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cig@@ ar gum and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were re@@ mot@@ ely finished by several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o &apos;s illustrated comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which would predi@@ ct a future in which the President Chel@@ ating would not be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually only received a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing would release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , a welcome type of happy re@@ union was given .
there is also at the opening of the exhibition a little deep and Star@@ kes , because Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ t from government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to get the rigid sp@@ ies which he actually should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg wondered after the strange timing of all of these things , she said that &quot; things happen out of a certain reason . &quot;
in a wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in its family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic collapse , its foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ ght@@ ful@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia of the artist ) , such as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take away , is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , can also be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so are the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic nov@@ els .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she emerg@@ es with a free hands of hands from the disciplines of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she ch@@ ill your speech , then they won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greet you from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ som@@ ed when I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was pre@@ looking forward in the comic book - but if it was to do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , by their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ations which were assembled as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
it was also targeted as all in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ sack was written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , by the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed in Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
University of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for murder
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who had been sought after susp@@ ects a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday the arrest warrant were issued on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest war@@ rants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents tell that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several p@@ ses .
a legal warning system found by the Chicago police authority that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ective the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 L@@ ath@@ em is professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University , North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , the vice president of the university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was right in ur@@ no@@ isy and excluded from the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal thing that is investigated by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co @-@ operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man at the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in every conc@@ ei@@ vable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want he turned himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ects of susp@@ ects to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have a not@@ ion of her position , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip that happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as much cru@@ el@@ ly .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team from Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the zeit@@ geist and the background of the victim , and investig@@ ates a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will close the W@@ A@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vi@@ bic@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vi@@ bic@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) will be implemented for the recovery of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the W@@ A@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko announced on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ A@@ DA plan to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ implementation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko he does not contain anything that could concern for Russia in Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the W@@ A@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list of criteria however , states that Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities issued the reported results of the W@@ A@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer , Richard McLaren to con@@ greg@@ ated government @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russian sports .
referring to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the examination as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has got a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we won &apos;t admit that which does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales catalog R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report lists controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was exp@@ elled from the W@@ A@@ DA in the wake of d@@ oping control in Russia in November 2015 .
however , it has been allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , W@@ A@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved in the right direction , in order to be used again .
Al@@ di is not selling eggs any more
this shared the business groups .
it is a pure precau@@ tionary measure , it could continue to be gone out of any health imp@@ air@@ ment , called it in the message .
from now on , only eggs are delivered to Al@@ di , which have been tested negative on fi@@ du@@ ous anti @-@ sh@@ ov@@ el .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency in its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company , not to become the next p@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls were not working .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - more worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers do not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply no consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ rett , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from outside .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is at the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through creating and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of staff commitment , it allows companies to conduct surveys , specialist groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow the C @-@ suite managers to handle and directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lint , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used to measure employees .
Er@@ rett said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lint .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ P@@ olls and surveys from certain teams , it offers a high heat map of the company , which shows the majority of the complaints and which senior executives have low @-@ compliant results - so that you can drill out why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so you won &apos;t have the next generation that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since then a former employee has published a blog post office , which has been accused of punished by those who have spoken .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lint , this wish is an overview of lu@@ cra@@ tive business possibility .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth by 2020 according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ t , the company helps to prevent bad behavior , and saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ tible has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber was recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lint , Conver@@ tible Company can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; p@@ olls , collect confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that can notify the employees of bad behavior .
and when the main business leaders agree , complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regulations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ tible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that its employees are po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ ethical , it can experience co@@ stly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has been used to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures , and have a simple way to achieve its headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to sign a problem , he had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail to corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel that said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company Conver@@ tible , there are problems that were previously found of executives that were hidden in offices in cities , or states - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or ir@@ lu@@ ci@@ er inter@@ ns .
&quot; I can be closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take eth@@ ics , values , and employees in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed because of eth@@ ic violations caused by the Enron scandal , Quin@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their law , &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor the eth@@ ics , people used hopes for a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lint and Conver@@ tible also offer your software as a service , and burden the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors which have supported both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ t received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ it@@ ters secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought up his entire financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the net@@ worked nature of enterprises , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect from their jobs more than before .
there are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley .
people want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated , and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten , when its portfolio enterprises run well . businesses are good when employees are standing and engaged .
if the Analytics Tools promise third @-@ promise , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is us@@ eless when the company &apos;s ste@@ wards take no measures .
in fact , when a company asks people after your feedback , there can be an anticip@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if the shift does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can motiv@@ ate appointments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 questions , you have to be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ter International , the company who has seen himself very much to collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to lead action on the same day if a problem has been reported about G@@ lint , so Er@@ rett .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated staff , it was re@@ alizing through the speed of decision @-@ making and quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
on Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights by the staff , and it hopes that long @-@ term perspective , which leads to a better commitment of workers in a industry , which is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose your business .
the N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it &apos;s about 23 o &apos;clock to enter@@ tain a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise areas of the team on campus .
some have drawn their triumph@@ al parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break .
players who are in@@ scri@@ bed to the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return at 6 : 30 at the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A are beginning at 19 : 15 to meet the players &apos; complete periods of time .
the journey away from the two days is more than a day , where the brood had shi@@ fted nearly a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time Mor@@ as performed six times in West@@ wood action .
they are planned to hold 18 exercises during August . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said he is supporting the control change of the N@@ CAA support , even if they add a further point to the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just squ@@ ashed it , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the Camp is finished , what was reached in view of the clear Si@@ zes of its fields from a adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class that is already covered with foot@@ balls , which will be a slight task behind the door@@ way .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched that people rent a room there and then take you up there to record a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and exercise of a practice , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I &apos;m not worried too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential items with counterfeit detection to fac@@ simile and their findings at the original fee then , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a review on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible detection , and it may indicate fac@@ tor@@ sional checks out of the original review from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main topics for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe that they also influenced US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters to be flooded during the presidential elections in May with wrong stories , and Germany will support a plan to quickly eliminate the social media networks as they did not succeed to eliminate h@@ ass@@ ure post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook was told in a separate statement in German , that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be started .
&quot; in addition to knowledge , what stories of fact are listed on the third parties , people want more context to make profound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for fac@@ ebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was a can@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has lived 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat in the Cas@@ ent River valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look for someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos;s sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it &apos;s not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agents in the 1700 &quot; s he worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters always smell of smoke , because it was kind@@ led a fire due to light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as if he himself is there .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who was sm@@ itten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council , England , and almost four months living in a castle ( &quot; To be honest ) , this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ än@@ s on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he emigrated through the grounds , the ruins of the ancient castle and spoke with land@@ scap@@ ing , gar@@ dening , and sometimes with the artists , who worked in the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only received full access in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
as a Rho@@ des of a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years in which arist@@ oc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent what had : &quot; one could mean that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families .
guys , let all go to the course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection are using the castle as a starting point to en@@ roll on the wider basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who re@@ built the newly built castle to join the farmers of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a recording of an u@@ pro@@ ar that occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Fam@@ ous of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pe@@ asant resi@@ sts began in this field and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , which hid the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the British Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , depicted in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell was portra@@ yed out of the 18th century , which filled his own funeral ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the actors are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &apos; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite pleasant to be , and will spend money for things that could not afford to afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men del@@ etes their school@@ crises , having married ancient women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to get hei@@ rs . &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ ams
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ ong@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind , the grounds of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has since been called back by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to finish with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : covered by over 300 years old Mari@@ an Chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ en@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f was launched on Friday their campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .
by Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team will be dedicated to Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and slogan .
at the end of August , a celebration of the campaign will be held on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the promotion since yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their last page .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to win your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm conviction that we know as bad honey@@ s citizens in order to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in action , there is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a distinctive characteristic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she is in the competition with other municipalities .
the town Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can make its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year in the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es over retirement and transport operations in the Offic@@ ers Corps .
so this week too .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
under the presidency of the government , the Prime Minister now also took part in the five Vi@@ ews &quot; s , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
there@@ with , the civilians were killed in the Y@@ as in the number .
the government draws the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and Navy were removed .
since the failed cou@@ p , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan , as a wire of the put@@ sch .
against 4@@ 86 people , who should have been involved immediately at the coup attempt , is negotiated in Ankara since this week .
on the day after the put@@ sch , Erdo@@ gan had referred to the overthrow of an attempt as a &quot; god , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to complete the armed forces . &quot;
but is Erdo@@ gan really a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ fixes in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in general , concern for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests in the repe@@ al of the head@@ room for sol@@ dat@@ ers , wrote the newspaper .
anyway , the big pur@@ ée near the army and the security forces continue .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent another 73@@ 95 constitution , among them 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers .
it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan is t@@ amed the military .
gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual men of the country .
three times she put@@ sch on her role as the sent@@ in@@ els of the world@@ ly State Rules .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan th@@ ron@@ ged the power of the military step by step back to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is committed to targeted a Islam@@ ization of Armed Forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who sought after the coup attempt of fear of fear abroad for asylum in a few years , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
if this is true , NATO could not allow Nato to be cold .
anyway , there is no doubt in the alliance according to the cleansing of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational skills be &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looks to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 a year , more str@@ ingent regulations for the creation of vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and limitations for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and will save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by way the U.S. will change the way as citizens from other countries green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit from our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate track for race @-@ platform
over the past months , over the future of the racing platform sh@@ utt@@ les have been disputed - now it is supposed to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year , the north @-@ west travel route is scheduled to be built .
in order to secure the future of the racing platform for the long term , according to the traffic ministry , construction work will start on the track that year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order to order and re@@ sign the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Il@@ men@@ au race track &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the country conf@@ esses to this important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained by public prosecutor Klaus S@@ üh@@ l , Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the amount for the over@@ h@@ aul of the route amounted to approximately 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent .
the contract , based on the shuttle , should also be ordered in the future of the country , will currently be coordinated , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the southern rail@@ ways are already familiar with the technical details about the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the timet@@ able to tra@@ ded the vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this should be ordered to be ordered for the race on December 2017 .
the race bike shuttle is one of the popular rail link between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ sti@@ g .
during the last months , the course of a pilot project has been tested if a sufficient amount of sufficient people will be used to order them in the future .
the route is also very con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought it can &apos;t be re@@ acted in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ zed Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start to take their ascent seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; people are doing so fun , but the companies deliver lots of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ jah in the publication of his new report .
modern sex dolls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon that feels warm - with consci@@ ously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust its robots according to his beliefs , &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot about the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples until the type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is more wor@@ r@@ ying because many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would look like a step@@ ford woman progressive .
modern sex dolls have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the real b@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are attractive as for example .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous figure . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Comp@@ an@@ ion .
so , what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
during the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
it can be tired , be fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in the mood ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the under@@ p@@ inn@@ y feminine properties , the accumulation on rape if you go one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( here : resi@@ sting ) Far@@ rah is worried about most .
on his website , true True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a Vi@@ br@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a Vi@@ br@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish , just another sex toys .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement indicate a little dar@@ ker and ti@@ pping in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal equality of the sexes , to a desire for sex with under@@ taking as an optional addition .
most men of course will have no sex robots , and while FR@@ R not@@ ices their rising popularity , however , they remain temporary on the edge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ ak@@ eth out of the Rand@@ om zones , can be in terms of the Spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or offensive , until them the free market gives permission to this .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that this highly sophisticated sex robots are in a time to emerge in which the women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there have been a pre@@ sidents in the White House to have attacked women sexually .
the awesome aspect of the TV series &apos; The hand maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn @-@ out body and the och@@ es eyes , but how realistic this vision seems .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind this sex robot is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their peas want that they feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robot is not a real women .
you can not separate or go away from their companion or go away .
they do not have a medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that could inter@@ fere with independence or anything that could inter@@ fere with the imag@@ inary under@@ taking .
expressed in other words , you are fake slaves .
or to express it in phr@@ ases by 2017 : maids
Tr@@ umps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a binary era that has become political sp@@ ies that have polarized US elec@@ torate , even families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and harvest than@@ ksgiving , there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with suggestions about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump sel@@ ectable relatives .
we strict take care of all to leave our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ umps , families assembled .
I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ wing di@@ chter@@ er who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visiting me this week in New York .
it remin@@ ded me that the unit can have a powerful effect on a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone knows whom she knows , including republi@@ can relationship , with whom she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
in order to find the dining table this certainly is a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resol@@ ving effect of his presidency has the power to move us all right to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sm@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that his m@@ itt@@ ens will not be rep@@ uted to one day .
however , there is a more difficult long @-@ term scenario , in which tr@@ ump republi@@ can of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in relation to its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of irrit@@ ability .
I find myself today of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s comic version - the dog on the car od@@ ach that looked 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax expl@@ aining ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur in a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of re@@ public@@ ans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an un@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to the Car@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ uss@@ ells of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the Fi@@ ber@@ glass @-@ designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ ck@@ ling and the animals are turning to look at full fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ at music convey@@ s this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a town dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are getting old , the Sky@@ lines are familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not be just a dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ th years to go on and all have a great time .
if I could have done the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one was asked about that .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to get the rating with a 15 % tip to purchase - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is meant to be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation , which is not necessary .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ous , while I felt tired of the experience , to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital for the second time .
last year , he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of his hand to the hospital , according to his prison authorities , according to a case in his prison cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after a ple@@ a of the pro@@ secut@@ ors for murder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he killed ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of the Friday 2013 , by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der , hidden in the cabin .
the pro@@ secut@@ ors announced their intention to hire this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of whom they say they were indul@@ g@@ ent .
the National prosecution authority said that it will raise the claim during the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold a strange egg finds
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the quad@@ ri@@ val@@ ents from F@@ üt@@ zen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen was released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the Ab@@ and@@ rop@@ es are going to school , four at the high school .
on Tuesday evening the school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed parents and representative of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for the school@@ ing , the 29 pupils of the four classes picked up the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eag@@ les , which grows in the poultry farm , but then released to freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Malt@@ ese Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to hat@@ ch it from his chicken .
instead of a h@@ owl , a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken , sm@@ ashing himself , the eag@@ les spread out its wings on a high hill .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank a hen .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cy@@ linders , around the bet .
the Adler is standing for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young may be different than the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to this .
he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wish everyone four@@ score that he feels at his new school .
it followed thanks to the colleagues , former school director Michael Mu@@ eller , who always jumps into classes of instruction , and the parents representatives .
the kis@@ sing period was now over , declared school teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their pup@@ il for two years of teaching only very much , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four@@ teenth vessel .
to conclude , all students would sound a song of summer time and holiday season .
this broke great joy with the children .
the new school year will already be applied for the new school year .

software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software have offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission behavior of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or bad are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anine at ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously applied only for the vehicles that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schumann software &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their re@@ armament has ordered the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced one @-@ day implementation in the coming months , but has no exact date called .
I have informed Daimler of writing all parties concerned .
if anyway , a inspection may be due , it will be done in their frame .
how long will the change@@ over move into a total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anine writes .
the hang@@ s from the commitment of the manufacturer , as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen voluntarily , the car manufacturers are not acting on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should this update take ?
re@@ armament itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming could it be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car of BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
presumably , foreign producers would attract , so S@@ met@@ anine .
is there a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but even in the regions where passengers thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is no value @-@ loss for older diesel .
the ACE advis@@ es , to be still waiting for sale .

we make the city li@@ ve@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement in the coming year .
the place is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
since 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been .
and the work still makes it great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press talk .
it reports varied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it admi@@ red him that no application has to fulfill the requirement profile .
the town is looking for a next time a architects or construction engineer .
so - under respect of regular dis@@ miss@@ al periods - have to be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach has been used as an under@@ statement authority , the applicant must show respective lines .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they don &apos;t want to fill this anymore , citizens would have to travel to Offen@@ burg .
but for the proximity to the city and itself is important , W@@ ack@@ ers , who reported from a good company climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office some important projects have accumulated , looking back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city li@@ ve@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is talking about the building and his staff certainly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Dutch park@@ ing@@ site are similar .
the tiny bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium san@@ itation is still subject matter .
the latter alone will strike some 1.5 million euros . &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
st@@ aging is available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of great playing room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener can be respon@@ sive to many , and flexi@@ bly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will often be comm@@ end@@ ously mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town stands under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have what it fits &quot; when re@@ constructions are approved , st@@ resses the out@@ going Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during a long @-@ term employee , he can count on many long @-@ term employees : Markus New@@ ai@@ er ( high @-@ construction ) has been doing since ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been in existence for 15 years .
also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified themselves and remain with the place . &quot;
continu@@ ity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if the city of Roland W@@ acker would like to focus on the city of Has@@ lach , he would have studied studies as a diplom@@ at or Bachelor &apos;s degree of architecture and have good knowledge of knowledge in the fields of construction and construction plann@@ ers .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ stand high @-@ construction and civil engineering , building planning , Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ b@@ san@@ itation , urban property management , urban property management and under@@ mining authority , including monuments protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : locked in the train ride
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators brought the blue bike from the railroad track in the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged , that the her@@ on freight had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male hands and look for them since night hours after them .
a ros@@ ar@@ oter roller and a bike @-@ driver had been observed near the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators brought themselves in danger of danger and end@@ anger also the train traffic .
in addition to the loss at the Lo@@ k and the plant and the delay @-@ minutes and the costs for rail freight transport could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages had been fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the train route could be guided without disabilities .
almost ten people were visited on Friday afternoon , two of them considered the correspondence .
freight trains failed , however , they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 metres high pipes .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help re@@ lie@@ ve IB@@ D ( Dec@@ ision disease )
red meats and chocolate can sound as a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could re@@ lie@@ ve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and bl@@ ur@@ ings , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhoea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers normally come to avoid meat and dairy products to re@@ lie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that contributes to the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the conducting researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immun@@ ity cells in the gut have to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide in food , do not enter into the body .
cells that are capable of destroying inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without damage to sensitive tissues .
when balance is incl@@ ined towards inflammation , it can result of inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , it was found that a type of tolerance reli@@ ve immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ate .
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of protein - to destroy the cells &apos;s appearance .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - that is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich nutrition can be toler@@ ated , less inflammatory bo@@ wel , if the same system also supports people .
the post@@ doctoral researcher in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan is a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it took out that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of them that had been separated , but had not been separated .
it susp@@ ects that the distinction had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that usually live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells , but were missing in mice .
mice were mounted in a sterile environment so that they l@@ acked a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed these kind of immune cells , and they received the L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers left L. disper@@ sion in a liquid and then carried small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ating cells .
as an active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabol@@ ism known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells decreased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells declined by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us L. disper@@ sion protect us in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ products from L. disper@@ sed the cells in humans such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially , high levels of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
in Manchester United , he signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pounds of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game , before the UEFA Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday and im@@ pressing in the cold role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira were to mar@@ sh@@ ed .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the blues and only managed to improve the Mour@@ in@@ ho in 45 minutes before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mour@@ in@@ ho said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready later than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va stadium , as Mour@@ in@@ ho could shape the start XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed that in this week , Mour@@ in@@ ho still wanted another new commitment , but it insi@@ sted that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic work , &quot; three of its four pre @-@ ordin@@ ated new@@ sl@@ ings to fulfill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , thank you for the club , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action took 18 hours and one minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole thing was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising previously .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new low@@ case for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is about , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was a leader of the SPD , the Prime Minister @-@ President continued with a certain concern after Berlin .
just not a stor@@ k from the party centre , merely no head@@ winds out of the League - so the most important desire of the electoral struggle .
since Martin Schulz has changed the party , the fundamental change has changed .
since then , the employees viewed from the Willy @-@ Brandt house with an alert horror the events in the SPD @-@ gover@@ ned state capit@@ als .
what Martin has got there since the beginning of the year , the head@@ winds would not even be described in the approach .
there were deep env@@ elop@@ es .
and one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal Party sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions from the SPD and the Green Party .
&quot; once more : red @-@ Green can simply not reg@@ ain , &quot; CDU Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber said to the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fac@@ tion@@ ist of a Green Party had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the country code his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Party executive leader Michael Kell@@ ner urged the El@@ ke T@@ wel@@ d to return to its mandate .
the transition to the CDU means a clear de@@ for@@ gery of the voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ets must immediately return to her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal business@@ man and election campaign of the Green Network in the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ ting a SPD suff@@ rage , when on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ scene reaches the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the survivors of the Green Members of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU without their own government .
it is the provisional climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD @-@ state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , calm down the comra@@ de s@@ und@@ y .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was then , too - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the deaf , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite breath@@ ed the party smoothly .
mu@@ d@@ ful sur@@ ged the comra@@ des in the weeks later .
then , when they had exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit from Hamburg arrived .
and with him came the next blow .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was kind@@ led .
and as he did in crisis communication so pretty much everything was wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz has been fighting for political survival .
so now Stephan Weil .
due to the VW @-@ exhaust trade and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony @-@ Prime Minister has already faced a country &apos;s criticism since longer .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures were added .
nevertheless , or maybe just that , because in recent weeks , Weil was getting stronger in the Con@@ federation of Ak@@ z@@ ente in recent weeks .
the Order &apos;s funeral in the former Mayor of Hannover , to display its power in Berlin , was also not hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s environment .
they let him grant him , as they spoke of a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite may occur .
because of this , because of the party &apos;s internal origin , the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on gre@@ enery is no blame .
and Martin not at all .
sometimes , the comra@@ des make an effort to keep its own ranks closed .
her anger focuses on the green , and here especially on the back@@ sliding par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic changes , such as Mrs. T@@ ets her own career regulations on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party emergency in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not because of its person as a direct @-@ candidate , but on the state @-@ list of the Dutch Gre@@ ens in parliament , the Lower Saxony Parliament continued .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; in@@ democratic maneu@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters aged four years ago was clear : people have been Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the European leader of the European leader in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career in terms of a future CDU MPs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; negoti@@ ates the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he requested to clari@@ fy the backgrounds .
I want to know if more has been more or it has given further comm@@ it@@ ments of the CDU Niedersachsen .
funding money for city centre III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years , can get support from the country soon .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative St@@ opping Urban Development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of what happened before .
since 1991 , there are in sens@@ ing regions .
back then , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation sector II from 2005 to 2016 , the allow@@ ance was at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous san@@ ings are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it was finally important to promote internal development , and not only new construction areas .
on 4 April , you will receive information from the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe , that there will be a san@@ ction area III .
the total funding amount to 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the commune sens@@ ations .
how do we develop a san@@ itation zone ?
one will continue to examine &quot; sh@@ ind@@ ler , &quot; where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it plays a role as though in the planned territory of all interest , to renov@@ ate .
if necessary , the territorial limits could also move again .
the jet@@ on at Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the content of the &quot; social city &quot; program , which would then be carried out in the context of the refurb@@ ishment .
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of interior designers , the improvement of living and employment relations , and distribution of infrastructure .
the measures would object objects , that is , per property , carried out .
the san@@ itation area would then be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for the promotion has been running since January 1 , 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the inventory inspection would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment area , to fill a questionnaire .
in November or December , the purpose of the sentence is expected to be started in the next year with the sanctions .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann said that every Commun@@ e had to perform the discussed advance tests .
it is therefore to assess the urban@@ istic ab@@ norm@@ alities and decide when it is rehabil@@ itated and in what extent .
for the respective property then a refurb@@ ishing property is also registered in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again go to sensation and make themselves a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel said , an essential success factor for the project would be the participation of participation .
therefore , it will be fra@@ grant which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and land@@ piece &quot; in which it concerns the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; Hou@@ sehold and Cab@@ al &quot; , information on size , distribution and residents can be made .
the blue &quot; branch bogen &quot; is only to be bott@@ led when used in the building business premises .
however , please note that Got@@ zel pointed out that a ful@@ fill@@ ful questionnaire is not simultaneously an application of funding .
moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler empha@@ sized that the distribution of funding is functioning after the &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; - who first comes , m@@ ild@@ ed first .
you can &apos;t make any funding for later . &quot;
as a result , photos of the &quot; village core II &quot; were shown to make the attendance of a renovation . &quot;
British inventor uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his office door , and can even start his office with a hand@@ movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and index finger and now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy life with technology through its company Bio@@ Be@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , an advisory an@@ aes@@ the@@ tist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a micro@@ chip and it takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the cost of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the decision of the White House to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn to an event that resulted in the American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the military , which was left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft truck from Mississippi , the helicopter was manufactured in Connecticut .
the White House Office demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter he landed on the South La@@ wn , after records of the Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only wanted you to be aware of that , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event its superior , Deputy Defense Minister for aeronau@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7@@ am on the South La@@ wn at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if depar@@ tures from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be needed .
the original circulation system was during the event at the helicopter , while security personnel remained on the ground during the period during the time .
out of the TIM@@ E , records were not clear , if a second flight @-@ system was ultimately required .
the Hatch Act also prohi@@ bits federal government to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 is asked whether the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was named as an official event , and would not be covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President announced a violation of reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to penetration the governmental regulation .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump led an investigation as the presidential plane in front of his first Kamp@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of announ@@ cing about the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Assistant Press report of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 Occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to dep@@ loy the U.S. President in the White House with precise Zen@@ ec@@ ers@@ aul@@ ts .
as a b@@ ump in July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise laboratories in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted on the training requirement of the plane for the month , an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units have an additional 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not last for any of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the conference .
a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved to exp@@ ose the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to static rates of the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D accounting for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the flight as a 30 @-@ minute flight from the Navy Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below the rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of valu@@ er estimates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , accounts for DO@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contrac@@ ting .
at this time , former press pre@@ ten@@ er of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go away that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment used for the so many Americans .
of course , it is appropriate to empha@@ size that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acts with the helicopter , when he entered his tour about the South La@@ wn to the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and captured with the media on its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen hel@@ pers
the city organis@@ es the Kit@@ a lunch@@ table again .
with firm contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back into the city &apos;s day@@ care centres .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the supply of food in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , Deputy Head of Youth Aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked is still cooked except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh boiled cooled .
the city runs in the Kre@@ fields region 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the kids get a warm meal for lunch time .
last year , 2,@@ 800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing constantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are not only children who are looked after 45 week@@ days in Kit@@ a at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time workers from 1 September kitchen service : they are warm up the supplied food , add them to salad , raw food and fruits , Por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , clean the food out , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; employees will be assigned to a kit@@ a , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance .
the size - there are two groups , as well as seventh tro@@ op facilities - decides about the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now fixed to the Kit@@ a team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier for the put@@ ties easier , educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children shall help to prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the Kit@@ a , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the Kit@@ a rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will soon be done by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of the kitchen capacity , also the charm that it has shown on the cost of self @-@ gover@@ ning and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical city , it says from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time workers are hired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at all about 750 persons in the education field , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative when all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , reig@@ ning head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are can@@ di@@ ct in the provinces . three women are can@@ di@@ ct for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible , if women are unable to participate in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban issued threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ ded with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time passed the power peac@@ efully from a democra@@ tically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
one union wants to make Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s managers on the long term commitment to production in the Glasgow plant .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company changed over the future of investment at the Toll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which offers other products hob@@ by@@ bs and rich tea biscuits .
for the last years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s manager , the company called on the president of the M@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s , &quot; concerns about the modernis@@ ation of production lines not being driven . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Toll@@ cross , concerns our members .
generations of families have worked here and the labour force focus on the local community and the big room Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social discrimination .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and before the background of Bre@@ xit , the increasing cost of life and the chronic output of production , the eastern end of Glasgow strongly ur@@ gently needed a thri@@ ving production essence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of plaque said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at Toll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to that , since we appreciate the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Toll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed the employees that we operate like all enterprises that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business is constantly checking out - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of Toll@@ cross as a production facility fully and entirely on . should our business processes change at the location , employees and their union representatives should be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned about three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League likes her interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti repent
in her persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave after a cost of £ 189 million in order to dissolve his free@@ wheel cl@@ ause , but have warned Barcelona three years before the world record .
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , and Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way where N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out on the outside , although a source in the neighbourhood policy insi@@ sted that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival of Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G pre@@ sidents in front of this view ?
when Manchester City were interested in the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club to sign up one of the best player of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they touch one of our players then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players to sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club pl@@ anting interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest in having lost one of its price for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ ot@@ ers throw and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , a unknown perpet@@ rator has cul@@ minated in the Königs@@ felder street in front of the estate market before the estate number 30 and so on the cl@@ adding of the vehicle is caused by more than 200 euros .
the Police Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , telephone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for evidence .
an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ cen@@ au and Le@@ ese are looking for the police witnesses .
because a car had to drive on its lane , the driver had to devi@@ ate from a VW Tour@@ an and touch@@ down the guiding line .
on Thursday night , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW , at 19.@@ 55 on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au , was coming in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of pride of Stol@@ cen@@ au there was a passenger car against him , so that he had to turn right to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver touch@@ down the head of the Tour@@ an .
non @-@ damage was originated in the passenger car .
the driver of the forth@@ coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued its ride , without care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident , it can be good that Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ kins did not notice the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police now asks witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the ren@@ dering war under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 with the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ cen@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report Collec@@ ts Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report about the abuse of pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the same author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the miss@@ al scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ , spokesperson for the reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regret about their own under@@ ings or at that time it would express the wrong evaluation of the processes .
the Vatican Chancellor &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that during the coverage of violence in the domain spar@@ rows are measured .
regarding the problems in Regensburg , I doubt that it would have to be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; did not need to be punished , but the &quot; degree of media mani@@ pulation , &quot; such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habits , the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; one likes to go on the church and it is a gre@@ enery fres@@ cos . &quot;
moreover , they pointed out that in their youth , &quot; had been a normal educational tool , &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one . &quot;
they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards on earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
totally in@@ justice , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who , with R@@ atz@@ inger , wrote the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg by the En@@ lighten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows have been sexually viol@@ ated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high impact victims .
in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who had been active in Regensburg , Germany from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summar@@ izing , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence were applied .
with high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , punishment for students could also fall heavy .
however , in contrast to numerous other not@@ ices , many of the victims were valued at R. estimates , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot;
in the interview Hes@@ emann explains why the final report for the mis@@ use scandal at the &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger won his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the &quot; inci@@ dents of non@@ violent exercise at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for a lift up many students to stand on &quot; humanity . &quot;
to the other , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ection that the econom@@ ist was handy , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz had no top performance .
how do you analyze this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you are doing the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask ourselves why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all ahead at all .
he is dedicated to eight sides , and he is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or fellow workers in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the violence at the pre @-@ school took place outside of its sphere of action .
you can &apos;t throw him any case , too late , or have the first to be taken seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was felt as literally as &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his students &apos; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provides an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sin@@ cer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understand@@ ably , &quot; as extremely good teachers who supplied the guys regularly with cakes , biscuits and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always turned from grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , which led also to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ed .
that he did not only scar@@ c@@ ate with chairs and threw the key to@@ l on the ground , but also ear@@ ns to the hair and ears , he has already been given to hair , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
however , to its honor of honour , however , such educ@@ ating methods in the fra@@ y time , the 1960s and 1970s were widely used , with parents like teachers .
do you still know such bre@@ eders methods ?
of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what it is actually stated in this report , namely , the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and violence at the pre @-@ school are the free Bag@@ at@@ ella .
as you wonder if it is not more to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media over@@ threw himself on him .
in the Bavarian Pope , there are many who never understood him , still eag@@ erly .
but the truth is : the report un@@ loaded Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , the report was reported much about the subject of mis@@ use in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also applied any handling or complic@@ ity in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have committed to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were con@@ se@@ cr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never shared myself to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the suffer@@ ers for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happened to me all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem at the En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was , and yet is that most victims are silent .
if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... not a case in which he had had legal knowledge ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had tim@@ ely knowledge and had the respective perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is equivalent to him ... b@@ ben ob@@ tru@@ sive , or rather un@@ clear , as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ors , confidenti@@ ality , etc .
that man speaks about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the run , affected students and / or whose environment confi@@ ded , could not be confirmed in the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as regards sexual abuse , George R@@ atz@@ inger is exemp@@ li@@ fied by every fellow worker .
so he cannot be accused of having prevented him , or brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to get his good name with these contradic@@ ted crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
in the media , there was much of &quot; violence food &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is indicted in the &quot; junction &quot; report .
do he have to live with this alleg@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in coverage everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is , in turn , is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is also clean separately : between the school and high school of the cathedral spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other pre@@ ul@@ cers .
furthermore , the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had not been ch@@ oral leader of the domain spar@@ rows .
the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of sa@@ unas were right and mal@@ ted , and were all amazed at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to have ruled .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do with them , because he got the boy first to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um .
it was , as most of the most witnesses empha@@ size , the subject &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
it was just happy to be able to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline there , but not sa@@ w@@ ling violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases believed even positive memories with him . &quot;
at most , the accus@@ ation still remains .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods , in which it was reported from the conditions at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he had not worked and responsible , ( as the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
swallowed by George R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the ranks consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , who even re@@ produced the report .
therein he refers to this point , &quot; that , in the pre @-@ school , the tests will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
he was even more urgent in view of the danger of negative pres@@ sur@@ ing public relations .
this was of course , of course , as legal clarity , as a test of investigations in Bavaria had long been banned in Bavaria .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us knows .
there was also difficult to estimate for him , where the victims are perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the allow@@ able limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is just not right .
only in 1980 the test of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis alleged that it was unfair to apply the standards of today &apos;s education standards at the time of time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we &apos;re talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger , the past to today &apos;s moral measures .
the prin@@ cess has quite right .
but that of course , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to all times and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of withdrawal and violence against innocent children &apos;s children , which is already familiar beyond that time .
that &apos;s all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it is finally re@@ worked .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for the disciplines and punishment , so ear@@ chers and to draw in the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment then he was forbidden to hold himself strictly .
which picture of his reg@@ ens@@ burger period is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
did the topic test also go to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , telling of his perspective , then the Dom@@ spar@@ rows played only one side role .
nevertheless , I failed by no means that he led a str@@ ingent regim@@ ent there .
but that must also be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without having un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible to form a national cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition , which went away twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , they only make no great singer and before every success , right on what territory , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people do you have to have George R@@ atz@@ inger over the conversations in their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : in addition to the work on the book and beyond , I met George R@@ atz@@ inger very well and ever experienced as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , faithful and heart @-@ good people who could not imagine that he could only harm a fly a fly .
I get regularly with how many former domains are still alive today , 23 years after his embar@@ go , regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and to treat him like a member of her family .
those who didn &apos;t forgive him today , that he was very strict to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the domain spar@@ rows are grateful to him today , that he enriched their lives and brought the world of music .
and that he always is a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly which may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ son , to whom they still see and honor them .
and please , once again distinc@@ tly : everything that you acc@@ uses , are correc@@ tive methods that were on the agenda .
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin@@ c@@ ass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the evil purpose that stands behind it , only too obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the report that has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now the app@@ rais@@ als , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great services and without the outside of Bay@@ erns and perhaps Germany &apos;s probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ aine Spar@@ rows , finally in peace .
