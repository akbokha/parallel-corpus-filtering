<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren Anstalt, where people are supposed to meet youths today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftkapelle, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers make the sole cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">It knows that everyone who had to get exciting, because the Auto-Navi had a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-atgas, an offer of the Geoportas Bayern of the State Government, are everything else - but therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is evident that cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century as towns and municipalities have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickr carpet, which one can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overvisible card, cities and municipalities were detailed maps, so-called world leaders.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying Administration between 1810 and 1864 and in the first surveying of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Napoleon, Napoleon wanted to find an overview of the occupied country and issued a topographic survey of Bayerns on behalf - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops moved with the peace of Lunéville, February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbours that create the idea of a wide-wide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian State council.</seg>
<seg id="19">The certificate for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is found like all other sites on the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / What is most impressive in the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is submerling that is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was born 21 years after creating the map, so 1877, the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the abdomen lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses were concentrated in 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: in the zoom, a small-piece card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called "primitive" which was derived from the fundamental tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Little plots there are no farmers there - but small husbandmen of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterised by submerling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the October Revolution, was in the 19th century still a lawn - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map is an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the opposition of today, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, there are not only the street name "at Gasteig" or from the hill "on the air" - but also in great letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, man locked once with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-Irrenanstalt "was created on the Auer Lüth.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the facility - that psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time, and finished the purchase of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the staff to turn violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first of all, it was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">Eventually, this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrentice in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists in Germany since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people are now encounter in the Munich Salesianum on the area of former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The order bought the building complex in 1920, and turned it into a youth-house with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, East residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the "Casa Don Bosco" house built in an architectural rejection to the reference construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was in 1856 as "main square," the Kaufstraße was called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also caused a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allied forces in December 1944 had holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a tomb of the Middle Ages were once more at the Marienhof during these days, and on April 5, 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony took place for the second S-Bahn family.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the shooting glean, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial view of today and the hole in the Marienhof stud.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group Published Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the National Association for the promotion of dyes has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks in the state after Missouri." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the state of Missouri, which is scheduled to come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and missourians to leave particular attention through the state, as a number of fragile, racial-based demonstrations in the recent period and indicated here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination against discrimination, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state to release the unresponsive to minority groups, prompted the group to release the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of the civil rights that will happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be put together or killed because of their skin color, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organisation issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist failure to black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died at the beginning of the year, after having no fuel in the country by the state, and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recently published report by the Office of the Office of Missouri by Missouri, which is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff inform about what could happen in Missouri" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring it to the account or to know the relatives that they are travelling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">"" "in 2015, Missouri recorded 100" "" "hate crimes," "" "according to the latest figures from the" "" "Hasselt" "" "program, which states the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place in the country." ""</seg>
<seg id="64">The itinerary is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had published travel warning for Texas and Arizona, having adopted the local prosecution authorities to arrested people because of migrant workers, which will benefit from ACLU to further racial abuse.</seg>
<seg id="66">The travel warning are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing net project is a success project, and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag and Kordula Kovac took a picture in front of the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the right-grave of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fishing industry came together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insight into its operation in which he houses 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many kittens and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The Black Black milk "is for him the alternative marketers for him of the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regional. at the table of the agriturismo, regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also called the BLHV-chair of Fisbach, he described the fence project as "elemental."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't grow in such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">Green land care for a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the scoresense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the elteristic operation and ordered this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead to bio operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the significance of the feminist project and is glad about the leader of the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers are estimated at cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the capacity of the areas could still be moved out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in critique</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open space is 40 hectares, which may not be forwarded until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 Euros, half of the leaders was funded, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers were 12 610 million, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of electric fences.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac emphasized: "you do not do a good job without farmers and country women."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White, the best food is being produced here. "</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape of agriculture (lpr) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of Weidefences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The premise is the presence of one of the lpr reported conveyor lines.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the fenced area may not be togable (crossing a slope above 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the performance.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisher electric fence in 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build a fence about 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest character of a regime change is to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate these as well as every other - therefore the fall of Saddam Hussein's place at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologist of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated battle with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President to dramatic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have laughed at him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked its importance, and in particular the importance of it was written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go on a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, that was later added, and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively properly, but as he formulated itself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemptible words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your brothroned masses, who longs to breathe freely, and the wading trough of thy rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time in which the" "" "eleventh waste" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly showed that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to do their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that she has completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicans by presenting the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this importance: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a completely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the geal with the picture is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to move from the right wing already long.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty has arrived, but rather an early Neoconservatory that bring the American flame into the recovering world: "lady Liberty goes on.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual, Limbaugh is stumbled on a bit.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great phantasily deed of Lazarus was to see them as they looked by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrendous travel on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome, which they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that's not the perspective, Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch shall not give the way to shine, but the hatred that is the only source of power is inflamed.</seg>
<seg id="128">Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two Schotts belonged to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance of the Athletics Men of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of World Championship races" "" "will afford a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes will be selected for London 2017 on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "Scotland has developed something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand and we will continue it until we find it," "" "black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"" "" "" "I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done." ""</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the road corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 square meter, while Eiliie Doyle was chosen from the team to the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her chapter speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"" "" "" "a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very motivated." ""</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling that gave Eiliie quite naturally, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete at its fifth world cup at the 400 m hurdles, says it's "incredible" is that 16 gravel in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-stream Muir leads this way back to five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminds himself of her first World Championships, when the only other Scotsman was in the Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The teams say that they are "enormously proud of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only among the team, but in some cases also at the medals and the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special thing to be part of the team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me, making it something special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to Podien.</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as chapter?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, since we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking the critics on Facebook: do not work for a public office if you don't want to feed your voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from the domestic policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He concludes with the critique, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in the year 1783 Washington said:" "" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we will be led like sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland by Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 people and have deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union competed him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the staff of the Governor's rod dismissed the suit as" "" "freezing," "" "and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with" "" "Well," "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has showed a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playfully his hair-out head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons, which come to the page of the Governor - which is a public forum, which is officially called officially and by employees working with public tax dollars - unnecessarily, and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Amelia Chasse defended the acts of the Governor and argued that the comments of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trout or spammers or hassure people who can slide the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who talk with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyers of Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD, was not hassented, but she asked for hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I said politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the message" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people in the same issue will take place, then it is rather regarded as a so-called collective deployment and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the Governor's "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "intercede."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critics or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in the past time, when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conductivities and to kill or demonstrators to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials, which is criticized for him to complain Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County was the last Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they named a electorate from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers carried out between 1776 and 1800 and anonymous letters beat on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous consoles.</seg>
<seg id="201">People who used Pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius, and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that make Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions which criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trading and navigation in the UK have overwhelmed his position, according to the historic documents collected by the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not make them silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of expression, opinion of opinion, and discourses are part of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept this.</seg>

<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the shutters were wrapped and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In the year 1796, French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs, and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened by 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">By 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilary Church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's eight, a storm split the steeple and the half collapsed.</seg>

<seg id="884">The recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine has started the test of tests last year.</seg>

<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases, in which the person was evaluated as over 18 years, does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has to be over his age.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have attempted and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Poltico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a steady course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporters Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, commented on his first day of working with senior employees, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information taken into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would get better choices if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosing makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by watching his meditation.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps related to television for decades - and now, where he's in the White House, his television is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs," said the former prime minister of Sam Nunberg in February opposite a politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter habits are under control, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps has ever been "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets without their interventions would have even more spark plugs.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets, which has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">When his staff already made it a few times, trouble the trouble of him, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody else has to prevent Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in a White House, which are composed of competing parties, are always trying to present their own agenda by promoting drump material which may potentially support their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">"" "politico - very busy with this story - reported on the preference of advisors to doubtful information on the preference for strategic reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example of being described by reporters Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former pumping officials say that Trump can react to negative press lines, especially those with condigesting leaks, and that he will find out to find out where these come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February, when somebody accused the president of malignant a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap of being at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned from Twitter or that he has been offered no specific evidence, or that he expresses false evidence in the past and revoke it in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tries to implement a system to manage and document the trump" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to prove more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors still strive to influence.</seg>

<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the suspension of the committee on the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the Western Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of the nearly seven-fold Berlin Berlins are solved.</seg>
<seg id="1520">The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar- and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The giant flowed over a trillion metric tons and 5800 square kilometres of large colonists now drive to the north and will probably take two or three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice-ants who have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change has played a role in the breakage of the ice, is unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, there has been a series of unusual coagarries in the region around 30 years in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in an factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">So far, the colander was a part of Larsen-C-Schelongs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Smelbows swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is still growing into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this feelight was the balance of waxes and disrupting some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A full swing will be traced there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-shelhen's Larsen was in danger, because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and could crumble, if there is a piece of scrap on a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Iceberg increases the sea level, as they swim on the water and ice so much water, as it is done after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the bill leads to the glaciers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level, but only in a small degree, the British research project writes on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI-informations with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth-largest bell-crackling of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural happening and not direct connection to climate change, the ice plate now comes into a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"that's the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, it is disputed whether the Larsen-C loop will grow back again, and possibly fall together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this trend will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher break the break of this gigantic ice age not on climate change, so in the past few decades the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long walk of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature increase has contributed.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula have passed around three degrees in the past 50 years, so that the temperature at the fastest increases in which the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effective, because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years, and in fall much more.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce will usually take wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unaudible drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what will feel safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the goal of a attack with grenades, or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have three words written on a board at the front of the room: adversaries, Neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being suspected of standing by the government, or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make chaos dangerous by Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no resting periods of violence, and throughout the country the bodies are frequent, more and more journalists have taken place: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto held its position in December 2012. 589 are after the attacks and threats of federal government and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake it is to be living in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, that shows his middle finger on the front of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahem.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a probands of the Federal Prosecution were built in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, this was only led by the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they are still looking to treat the violence of Sinaloa while they are intrinous and although the terrain is still digniated.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting of the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "so long as we don't know the Why we are afraid of all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was shot out of his car and sentenced to him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelve River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But about Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest in the past year and the surrender in the United States in January was Sinaloa to become one of the most bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">There is nothing that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the road or that the graveyard is full of consuming, two-story Mausoleum for drug Royal, which are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes two misunderstanding has contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February, the publication of a interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rival map factions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have annoyed the children, suspicious gait bought each copy of the output as soon as she was shipped to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez not to force Valdez, after the capture of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country to its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as experienced reporters for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without pushing the noise of the dowry problem," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest coverage, and the turnover and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard treading investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria - Moors" Cabot Award "for its reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drugs history, wherever they did.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave himself that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa, "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October.</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to ask:" "" "what did you do with such a lot... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce Team missed Valdez, the fun-bird-bird, who could fly like a dockworker, the friend who was generously with hugs and ratings, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He always would carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He always would go to El Guayama, the bar towards the office, and there always will be sitting at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine to his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death too has forced them to ask their own assumptions about how they can do their work on the best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it, if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret start and landing ways." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggelroutes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed. days earlier became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">In the outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in Culiacan area.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who were the governor himself as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporter went into the mountain landscape, where the drug abuse are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For this week, Riodoce passed on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending which concentrated on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group called in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Office Ceport, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who has been kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when everyone in the city knows what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost all political levels throughout the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In fact, Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, among them one, in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went into a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers used the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers who protesting against the killings of journalists because the employees had become something that she never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the Office.</seg>

<seg id="1891">On this day the director Bojorquez is gone out in Washington and tried to collect international support for the justice in Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and kill them because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has therefore asked that she is again devided by the government because she is concerned that their rage has violated its objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, taking part in government officials and a Gender Equality. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug abuse, but also on orders of politicians and security forces which were using organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="1938">The heavily damaged dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide itself from predators, and used a parachuting technique, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to mix well into its surroundings and retreat to his enemies, experts say what was threatened by greater dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one from a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to expose it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the confrontation, a common defence method in the animal rich, meaning that the head of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the eligibility is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals surviving today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs was hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, hunted by the evolution of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, who use the shady shading - think of deer, Zebras or belts - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey, what signals that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real battle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behaviour on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs dators have been of the Cretaceous period," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales are also showing that the skin of the dinosaurs was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on his life, including he's fourth performances, to find out what it was eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river and driven into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with contrasting skin, but remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast," Brown said.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when gigantic thermal periods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, the Earth went through.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the pandefied dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus one 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>

<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator's app, which is the most convenient type of the ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last one needs a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "Comfort Check-in" works: you get up in the train, calls his ticket under "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test accounts, a button to the electronic destandings appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train conductor get a message to their mobile devices a message that Passenger X is located in the train and taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the train conductor at the speedcard control at No. Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already defied online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those often departs, knows that in addition to delay and missed trains, the ticket checks are among the largest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, in any case, one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to get into the exploitation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card is either missing, or a document that is required.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between train directorate and driving direction, which leads to bad mood in part or large space and delays in control of their own tickets and take the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2019">As an activist came to study the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she had arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment which rented and scroll through facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled upon a post of someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18 year old child, and it still lies on the street," "" "called it there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused when nobody posted on their feed, she completed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly praying at its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo., killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body, stretched out on the street and stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that is wild," "" "said Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing for them and their community nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She made her cell phone to return later on the evening to Tweets of people on Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, the screamed, and by a man who claimed to be a Browns father, who carried a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons Police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They observed a live feed, where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, assured another policeman, his rifle and cried, "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," Ferrell remembered her statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder that we have used to call ourselves and we can call it typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she got her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell ran with her daughter, who carried a flower-dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had lots of times in front of this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we now go to Ferguson because the police have killed an 18 year old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take it, "Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be reared.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is to free to free us.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the luck to give you an experience in which she has not experienced a delatant racism, it is not unlike the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would have a bad service to hold them away from it. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground as activists on the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson waited.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business partner, who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped them to pass protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new species of activism began to accept form for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black congregations.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell in the sense: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview, "We've heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised up their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, a artist from the area that is known for its activism around Todestract Insulations.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought to Ferrell the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us. we talk, "Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people are presented, because I'll be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">"" "the goal was not to focus on Ferrells - to show that" "" "not about a Messiah leaders, but to a community that comes together," "" "said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participants of the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells how she loves and marry her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understand that there must be a certain degree in this work and in the realization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells is repeating the role of black gay men in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">"" "two of the three founders of the movement, who have influenced the film" "" "BlacklivesMatter" "" "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay." ""</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried out the movement," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are fighting for different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women have to carry the main burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "follow Folayan agreed that" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is no affirmmatic type of action," "" "when the Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who shook this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "no coincidence, although she was in front of the front, because in a life at this crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">The news cameras in Ferguson has long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police have still continued.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway with a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area they called her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">However, she clamped on a singing and she feels committed to this memory ever since she went into Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "Megalahn": TV readers discuss over Bit Gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves people, although they are not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the Süver of the pedestrian precinct since the first presentation in 2009, the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme is hardly any cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The theme is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While they say a bit of the bit-gallery, "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real-class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "don't need a man" (Siggi Bose) or simply: "megalahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates build that a gallery has more customers in the city, which also benefit from the rest of the business, the adversaries fear that then the pedestrian zone bleeds.</seg>
<seg id="2095">The gallery will be added: the gallery will offer exactly on the grounds on which the farmers market stands, offering 13 direct marketing products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will conclude.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Beda place with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we've been selling almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the country women always happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have discovered the butchers of butchers.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there are also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing can be posted in a market hall in the gallery, comes at the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "this should probably not be low in the new project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what are your shopping venues in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekend market, it is more important that the market hall will remain at least.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For all, the goods offered are fresh, mostly offered by the producer and is obendable.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop stores are rented in a shopping center only from larger firms because the dorous rents are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special transactions are almost no longer and what is left, will then disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit me together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market place during building time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA is the solution - even in duration when the bit-gallery has actually come out.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already create a bit-bit-gallery before, to drive all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will just not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty, nobody needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market, rather than this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market, it is thanks to the insane many - how I find - sensual construction projects in bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the Peasant Tavern is made, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, almost unweightful - which hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 Portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen Tupipes and haircut sections, which were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst demon a 35-year sentence after she had publicly initiated diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is a Becoming Resemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline had their expertise in technology, computer sciences, and art, and Manning, a transwife and signalling dissideration, whose sentence had been transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which could look up from the 30 portraits, such as someone can look like with these genomic data - the many wise men as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been talking openly about the identification as woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison her picture was suppressed, so very that there was only one photo - a grain, black-white Selfie, where Manning sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinblonde hair - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012-Project "Stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">Therein, the artist portraits of strangers made from forensic artefacts such as cigar gum and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," declared Dewey-Hagborg, a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were remotely finished by several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo's illustrated comic "Suppressed Images," which would predict a future in which the President Chelating would not be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only received a few days after the book was released, Manning would release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, a welcome type of happy reunion was given.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also at the opening of the exhibition a little deep and Starkes, because Donald Trump takes a war against informant from government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to get the rigid spies which he actually should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg wondered after the strange timing of all of these things, she said that "things happen out of a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her superior signature (the "i" in its family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic collapse, its foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thoughtfuller of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), such as astonishingly similar, at least in biological ways, all of us.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully take away, is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, can also be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so are the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novels.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as she emerges with a free hands of hands from the disciplines of the United States as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2212">Errett said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap-Polls and surveys from certain teams, it offers a high heat map of the company, which shows the majority of the complaints and which senior executives have low-compliant results - so that you can drill out why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture, so you won't have the next generation that has been involved in scandals, since then a former employee has published a blog post office, which has been accused of punished by those who have spoken.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is an overview of lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion worth by 2020 according to the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convert, the company helps to prevent bad behavior, and saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convertible has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber was recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convertible Company can send customized "pulse" polls, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that can notify the employees of bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leaders agree, complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulations," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convertible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that its employees are poorly treated or unethical, it can experience costly consequences due to consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has been used to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures, and have a simple way to achieve its headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to sign a problem, he had to find a telephone number or e-mail to corporate headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel that said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convertible, there are problems that were previously found of executives that were hidden in offices in cities, or states - like discrimination, harassment, or irlucier interns.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can be closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders in employment dispute." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies started to take ethics, values, and employees in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethic violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their law," that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor the ethics, people used hopes for a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convertible also offer your software as a service, and burden the company with recurring fees for use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors which have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convert received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the entire capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitters secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought up his entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprising, in view of the networked nature of enterprises, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research, which shows that today's employees expect from their jobs more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">There are high salaries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2241">People want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated, and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that's their voices, and that the work that you do is worthwhile, then they feel stronger to make this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience with LinkedIn, both Convertible and Glint."

<seg id="2243">Investors reach Renditen, when its portfolio enterprises run well. businesses are good when employees are standing and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics Tools promise third-promise, commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless when the company's stewards take no measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks people after your feedback, there can be an anticipation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the shift does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can motivate appointments and employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 questions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in the business management company Kotter International, the company who has seen himself very much to collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now performs monthly employee surveys, was able to lead action on the same day if a problem has been reported about Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated staff, it was realizing through the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">On Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new insights by the staff, and it hopes that long-term perspective, which leads to a better commitment of workers in a industry, which is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was a canophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-er and 1980-1980.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has lived 700 years of turbulent history of its cozy seat in the Casent River valley in Kent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It's not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be reacted in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emerized Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University of Sheffield and Co-founder of the FRR, we have to start to take their ascent seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are doing so fun, but the companies deliver lots of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharjah in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust its robots according to his beliefs, "and select everything from the eye-color of the robot about the shape of the nipples until the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is more worrying because many robots have the "personalities" that would look like a stepford woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real botix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are attractive as for example.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relentness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous figure."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So, what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired, be fixed on conversation, or she can be "in the mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the underpinny feminine properties, the accumulation on rape if you go one step on Frigid (here: resisting) Farrah is worried about most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, true True Companion Roxxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a Vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish, just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement indicate a little darker and tipping in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal equality of the sexes, to a desire for sex with undertaking as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men of course will have no sex robots, and while FRR notices their rising popularity, however, they remain temporary on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaketh out of the Random zones, can be in terms of the Spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>

<seg id="2433">In order to find the dining table this certainly is a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meats and chocolate can sound as a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States, causes stomach cramps and blurings, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers normally come to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that contributes to the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The conducting researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immunity cells in the gut have to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide in food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of destroying inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without damage to sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When balance is inclined towards inflammation, it can result of inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance relive immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their initiate.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to destroy the cells's appearance.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan-rich nutrition can be tolerated, less inflammatory bowel, if the same system also supports people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan is a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it took out that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of them that had been separated, but had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It suspects that the distinction had to do with the intestinal microbiome of mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were DNA sequenced, and there were six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells, but were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were mounted in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbiome and they did not developed these kind of immune cells, and they received the L. Cruteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers left L. dispersion in a liquid and then carried small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerating cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As an active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan-metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells decreased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells declined by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us L. dispersion protect us in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-products from L. dispersed the cells in humans such as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report Collects Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report about the abuse of pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the same author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the missal scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissen, spokesperson for the reform movement, "We are Church," stated after publication from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of emerized Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret about their own underings or at that time it would express the wrong evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican Chancellor "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that during the coverage of violence in the domain sparrows are measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the problems in Regensburg, I doubt that it would have to be "shameful and shameful deeds" did not need to be punished, but the "degree of media manipulation," such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habits, the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion that" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "one likes to go on the church and it is a greenery frescos."</seg>
<seg id="2898">Moreover, they pointed out that in their youth, "had been a normal educational tool," to be done with naughty children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards on earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Totally injustice, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who, with Ratzinger, wrote the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report, which was presented by the Bistum Regensburg by the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domsparrows have been sexually violated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high impact victims.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who had been active in Regensburg, Germany from 1964 to 1994: "summarizing, so that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence were applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">With high Emotionality, punishment for students could also fall heavy.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, in contrast to numerous other notices, many of the victims were valued at R. estimates, and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report for the misuse scandal at the "Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger won his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report about the "incidents of nonviolent exercise at the Regensburger Domspatzen" is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lift up many students to stand on "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">To the other, he also appears as a choleriker and Perfection that the economist was handy, when a Domspatz had no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you analyze this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you are doing the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask ourselves why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all ahead at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight sides, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the mid- or fellow workers in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the violence at the pre-school took place outside of its sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can't throw him any case, too late, or have the first to be taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzymnasium, on which he worked, was felt as literally as "redemption," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his students' Georg Ratzinger also provides an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincerely," "competent" and "understandably," as extremely good teachers who supplied the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and "always turned from grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high Emotionality, which led also to Wutaused.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only scarcate with chairs and threw the key tol on the ground, but also earns to the hair and ears, he has already been given to hair, deeply regretted and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to its honor of honour, however, such educating methods in the fray time, the 1960s and 1970s were widely used, with parents like teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeders methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced this in a worldly school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually stated in this report, namely, the horrible sexual abuse and violence at the pre-school are the free Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">As you wonder if it is not more to do with his acquaintness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media overthrew himself on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian Pope, there are many who never understood him, still eagerly.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report unloaded Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, the report was reported much about the subject of misuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also applied any handling or complicity in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have committed to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I've never shared myself to talk to my father or my mother," "" "said one of the sufferers for the others," "" "It happened to me all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem at the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was, and yet is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-student Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... not a case in which he had had legal knowledge (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it is equivalent to him... bben obtrusive, or rather unclear, as opposed to their parents, internators, confidentiality, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That man speaks about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in the run, affected students and / or whose environment confided, could not be confirmed in the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As regards sexual abuse, George Ratzinger is exemplified by every fellow worker.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of having prevented him, or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to get his good name with these contradicted crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, there was much of "violence food" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is indicted in the "junction" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in coverage everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is, in turn, is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is also clean separately: between the school and high school of the cathedral sparrows, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other preulcers.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Furthermore, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger had not been choral leader of the domain sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys of saunas were right and malted, and were all amazed at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions have to have ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he got the boy first to face when they were already on the Domspatzymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It was, as most of the most witnesses emphasize, the subject "Preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was just happy to be able to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline there, but not sawling violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims were estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases believed even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the accusation still remains.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods, in which it was reported from the conditions at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school where he had not worked and responsible, (as the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Swallowed by George Ratzinger in front of the ranks consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzymnasium, who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">Therein he refers to this point, "that, in the pre-school, the tests will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">He was even more urgent in view of the danger of negative pressuring public relations.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course, of course, as legal clarity, as a test of investigations in Bavaria had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult to estimate for him, where the victims are perhaps exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the allowable limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis alleged that it was unfair to apply the standards of today's education standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we're talking about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," so the danger, the past to today's moral measures.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But that of course, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abustomed to all times and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of withdrawal and violence against innocent children's children, which is already familiar beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all terrible and I'm glad that it is finally reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for the disciplines and punishment, so earchers and to draw in the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment then he was forbidden to hold himself strictly.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his regensburger period is Georg Ratzinger, because in the talks with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test also go to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, telling of his perspective, then the Domsparrows played only one side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I failed by no means that he led a stringent regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that must also be said: without these perfectionism, without having unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible to form a national cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition, which went away twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone, they only make no great singer and before every success, right on what territory, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have to have George Ratzinger over the conversations in their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: in addition to the work on the book and beyond, I met George Ratzinger very well and ever experienced as a wonderful, humorous, faithful and heart-good people who could not imagine that he could only harm a fly a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former domains are still alive today, 23 years after his embargo, regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and to treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who didn't forgive him today, that he was very strict to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domain sparrows are grateful to him today, that he enriched their lives and brought the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always is a good, paternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly which may be - but also a lovable respectson, to whom they still see and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again distinctly: everything that you accuses, are corrective methods that were on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make a medial sincass.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"" "" "" "there is the evil purpose that stands behind it, only too obvious." ""</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the appraisals, a 93-year-old man who had acquired great services and without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps Germany's probably know the Regensburger Domaine Sparrows, finally in peace.</seg>
