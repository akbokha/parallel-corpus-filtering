Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m getting stuck in dra@@ wers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
that the Hollywood star has now made clear clear in an interview clearly .
&quot; I will always put in dra@@ wers or get stuck from the outside label , who usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about that she explains as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of them sing the actress at home , front television with lo@@ cker@@ ish tur@@ tle and Mexican food , it is called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked the question of the child &apos;s desire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We must not have married or children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is no children &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film is going on with us from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger moved with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport py@@ rami@@ de &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered her holiday , they hunt for the comfort in the quick gal@@ lop home .
a kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and so the hor@@ semen ended it again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - back in the near of horses .
he left with his family on the grounds of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he doesn &apos;t swear to a photo .
for the first time in Aachen , Germany was the first time in Aachen , Germany .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports enthusiasts over@@ took the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala with Golden S@@ py@@ rami@@ de .
there is no hon@@ oring the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Federal State Department , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour players of the year ...
even the British Queen ar@@ ous@@ ed him already .
long is the 18th lau@@ re@@ ate of the Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de .
in Aachen , he met the first prize lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 further outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , two times the winner of the German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was recorded on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among these are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard Gor@@ geous .
many of these sports le@@ vers came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively society went into the Spring@@ field where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the great animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ umps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
to invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential seek@@ ers , however , are at tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
the , about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns that the state of the economy can harm - with tax and regulatory .
Clinton wants to protect the economy and regulate the economy , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , asser@@ ts tr@@ ump .
he will ride reg@@ uli@@ tions massi@@ vely , and he is strong for an extensive tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies .
Clinton said : the state has certain tasks to open , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open and needs money .
for that reason , taxes for the rich would be increased , says .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in the needs to be invested , tr@@ ump and Clinton said almost wor@@ ding .
the democratic applicant is even the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and become strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical team of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be a further internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and run coal extraction in the US .
oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas , to termin@@ ate the Parisian climate agreement .
Clinton wants to expand and calls for renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - including international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the fur@@ tive trade agreement , don &apos;t want to sign both .
at the same time , both the US don &apos;t want to ins@@ ist from international trade , but just to protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , Clinton calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars would be fam@@ ed .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The minimum wage has to stop , then he says he should not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the great discussion of the next months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on one side , there is a tr@@ ump that wants to lie@@ ve the economy and citizens to spur growth .
his critics stop him , so the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton says that at least of the weal@@ thy wants to pay more taxes and their critics saying : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who alone flee , almost to everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
one house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each baby has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has placed her little son in the arm .
he looks very curious with big eyes in the room .
his mother sti@@ ckers on the table top .
until they notice they are observed .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
to say with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is part of Con@@ dro@@ bs &apos;s Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid offers in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen have fled .
they live in the Munich north of one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ eing women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated saying : every woman who comes here has made his escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted because they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; torture or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or as their families send it as the hope of hope to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal out of it because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , hon@@ ours , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this continued to drive them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; for example , tu@@ g@@ boat call for a bottle of water a sexual act , is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end , once they are coming in Germany , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and worst if mis@@ used .
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the Munich Region is trau@@ mati@@ zed , trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so familiar to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the living , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since she often does not hesitate to assist , there are more accommodations for them , calls for danger .
in Bavaria , the seven District governments for the accommodation of refugees are responsible .
on the question of whether they are aware of a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is nothing in the governments of the governments .
even in Schw@@ aben are also not divided separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press contacts of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are in some common areas of floors or their own houses , only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; missing the privacy or are women and women together , it may come to - persistent - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the shower rooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women , stands in the study .
how much the women feel this protective needs , you may appeal to the And@@ re , which there is on the house in Munich .
&quot; since that we have been talking about it , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one could easily open a second house .
assistance of assistance : demands for new labour campaign
representatives of Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists have called for their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures regarding their disp@@ utes regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has asked its entire Council to appro@@ ve more workforce from early September .
the J@@ DC said that it would not be united to worry about the treaty .
in July , Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists and Medi@@ z@@ un@@ ud@@ ent agreed upon the re@@ jection of a contract with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said the government had remained difficult &quot; to have problems , which led to the contract that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of what has the J@@ DC Board voted to reject the proposed new contract , and requests the official new negotiations for all E@@ uren concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has set up a formal proposal on a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to make a comprehensive program escal@@ ating strategy that starts at the beginning of September .
in addition , disp@@ utes were reported that Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists met six times the first six times in the history of the N@@ HS .
according to the election of BM@@ A Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana re@@ signed the agreement of the agreed agreement conditions which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place in front of the vote by 5@@ 4.000 Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists and Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ ants where the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be en@@ forced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of outer sides &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and pro@@ claim an official end of eight months in the words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish def@@ ender in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot for@@ feit the int@@ ru@@ sion that Ankara wants most reconciliation .
there was a hand , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile worked very narrow and it radi@@ ated hardly heat , even for its restra@@ ined conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , however , spoke of his &quot; loving boy@@ friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to crisis , but could even be improved .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have heard that it would never happen anything .
for me , his enthusiasm seemed to signi@@ fy the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s da@@ zz@@ ling , sustainable bol@@ dness showed that Russia &apos;s head of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution : the removal of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ able .
Putin par@@ ted out and accused Ankara to fall Russia into his back .
the reason was even bigger , as it was committed by a mine boy@@ friend .
the Vet@@ ro@@ e will be re@@ building up again , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the government controlled media introduced a sharp , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
once upon a time , the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
on the serious test , the accus@@ ations of senior officials , Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading to Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse for the excuse that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire is clear on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan is first of all friends who can get , after having revealed the last month with a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they are counted towards a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television forecast fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are once again allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it in this way : &quot; tourists long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is mad at the West , since its reaction to which tried power to be weak as weak response .
to this end , the per@@ sist@@ ently res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke insi@@ sts that the cool mood should benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West .
in Ankara , the Russian state of state won a bonus that he demanded the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat in Ankara following the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is well @-@ known for Moscow , a self @-@ emin@@ ence that has to change a deeper fear of regim@@ es .
the summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one as it once described to me an analyst , &quot; Alliance of Foreign Ministers &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the west and then feel badly treated .
nevertheless , despite the public pro@@ pi@@ ti@@ ation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual parties .
it might be reve@@ aling , that after almost three hours of the first talks , both pre@@ sidents of the press conference said that they had not stri@@ ped the issue .
the President of Turkey avoided it deliberately to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to empha@@ size them .
there is no clear con@@ sensus about where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disper@@ sion , as the NATO member , Turkey def@@ rau@@ ded the Russian fighter jet - it certainly is better that the two leaders speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
the R@@ BS stamp is said to be reduced to a Back@@ office role in accordance with the Bank Council .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the Scotland that the R@@ BS brand had connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the bank has since dist@@ anced itself since eight years ago , and had to be saved .
at this time brand st@@ ats &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumers .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to move more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B Refer@@ ences , the de@@ centr@@ alized head office and the stock exchange to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for private clients who get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be to our investment brand and the brand in which our employees will be busy as we are going to become more about a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank was transformed into a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we are not pursuing a global goals , but local goals .
each of these stamps will be completely different in their own con@@ greg@@ ations and our employees are working among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship anymore and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the bank of brands , as we focus on inside ( we asked ) to do this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; said CEO .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ically in three years ago , when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched this brand .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re@@ launch these stamps again , so I think that time has come .

D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double by New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th win
on Friday , the jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured a winner of the British profit in New@@ market on Friday .
he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , who is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second gain of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he will follow Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , Lester &apos;s Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat E@@ dd@@ ry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ year winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it is done at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ ish Friday evening with 20.000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he wins the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two yo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
Lester &apos;s Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career goat
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of Modern Age and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , just a few ahead of him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tic intel@@ lect , that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma inspired fans for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie before some weeks at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already picked 6,000 win@@ nings , if he would not only be a weekend and grand@@ master jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has suffered almost 30 years of winners in UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying on Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of British low@@ lands since two decades .
it was annoying .
a complete series of large tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he survived also a plane crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago , he had in the beginning with difficulties when he returned from his six month @-@ long sperm , but showed an impressive characteristic of his guns and to return to its best .
and he has not yet been at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russian Putin over@@ threw Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin was un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of the closest confidenti@@ ality circle of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed a Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport affairs .
in a position of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been deputy in 2012 in Ivan@@ ov@@ s and was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital , Tall@@ inn , he made his conclusion at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s embassy .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it means ( in Russian ) that he later became a leader and head of government personnel .
he said to Putin on his appointment : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important role of the government to support your activity as head of state and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made a mystery .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time in one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet intelligence , K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that Chief of Staff res@@ orted to his own request .
but despite the smile &apos;s smile for the cameras , just a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so , is the result of a sort of power struggle ?
no one knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man , who was praised once as a potential president , was once said to lead the Russian environment policy - pushed for big scep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin which will be quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ ained to confi@@ dential post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the position in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
once , Ivan@@ ov was forced to become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , because a third official mandate of Putin had to viol@@ ate the Constitution .
but this item was taken from another , near allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister , before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after he stroke producers
Gibson was involved in a physical discussion at the set of series in Los Angeles during the last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series , announced in a joint statement of his resignation .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , was preaching on Thursday before the dis@@ closure of his resignation .
on the set there came to artistic differences and an opinion of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Queens@@ ed Cross@@ ing : bridge connected with fi@@ fe as well
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of Queens@@ ft Cross@@ ing to the Vi@@ adu@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four re@@ members of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approach to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 wires .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
economic minister Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queens@@ worm Cross@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineering at this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a fin@@ ick@@ y activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks at their place and the last part of the Dec@@ ks get a concrete pit for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted at the bridge to his seat .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project makes a sh@@ utter of future @-@ proof high @-@ construction and deep @-@ construction .
after the installation of the last road covering and its connection with the North tur@@ key deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side .
this has been reached 700 milli@@ meters south by pulling the northern state angle .
this was a massive and very fin@@ ick@@ y activity .
massive , because the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be moved at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % upwards .
most sacred , as the toler@@ ances where the team works , tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
three men have &quot; fortune still alive &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck the rescue station on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the winds ble@@ w up the boat apart from its range until we sent to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted in the age of 60 and was found on a boat without a life@@ jacket .
they all arrived aboard the boots , and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men were thrown into the water , happiness is un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Boot@@ engine had an emergency stop@@ over , however , that dis@@ solves the boat from the boat from the person , which controlled the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
heavy injured - man p@@ ushes his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had to get the key to the apartment for his personal things .
instead , the alcohol cut out the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed to her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police could capture the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished one of his sister .
together with her life partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
so she went with her li@@ fel@@ lows out of the house .
on the street , she met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women stepped up the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old created his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds brown @-@ silent apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green mean : investors are supposed to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,@@ 300 homes in the next few years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; action concept &quot; for the next rat@@ ern@@ ing .
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Christoph Fr@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas will have to offer 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap flats , however , can also arise in the stock market .
however , the big dispute in the town hall is , however , the Brat@@ mann : &quot; how are we talking to investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want Invest@@ ors on such faces at least 10 percent , but as possible as possible to build 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing project programme , which will cost millions , will have to be paid for inc@@ en@@ tives .
the problem , so Fr@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU wants to make a few rules as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the left @-@ wing plans to vote for investors .
regardless of it , the Brat@@ mann , whi@@ pped the situation on the residential home market .
the action concept is implemented , will ensure additional tasks in building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program does not yet complete : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments are supposed to be built @-@ in .
but how is it compar@@ ing the loss of another about 1300 convenient flats , which will run out in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , so the plann@@ er spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be rede@@ emed by the city .
moreover , it would have to be thought to get back into the price .
this is possible in the West stadt .
on one stroke the problem can solve .
because in the west city turn to the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get there in the price for cheap apartments .
only : they don &apos;t want the owners , housing companies not .
because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the West stadt will dras@@ tically increase dras@@ tically , one can be removed from the target of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
the Gre@@ ens count that there will be even movement in the discussion .
Swoboda : Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU must be with the boat . &quot;
the company focuses on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean , that not yet a compromise can be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teenagers and child may not go out without any longer , but rather prefer@@ ring their leisure time to spend on screens , was be@@ ted in the last decade of many .
at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and be more active .
the screen at first time was on the TV , then restricted to video games and recently on smartphones .
therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
I also refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture fell the interest in the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries has been post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their smartphones are looking out and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mons that were followed by a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( over a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the wa@@ ahn and jum@@ ped for the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that returns the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35,000 users , announced that within two days after the market launch of the game , the number of participants followed every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it &apos;s only the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for health , people want to get &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compete in deaf ears because many public emb@@ assies are getting boring and come from people who look like mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
those who work regularly sports , reduces its chances to get involved in cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages , which is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that there is people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
so there are three pillars of health covered , movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people work on the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
anyway , there are also mos@@ aic games that must always compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run around a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already follow our activity before , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be re@@ plen@@ ished with the time .
however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the immune system .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now at the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ bine inv@@ oked the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and the Final Five &quot; Team kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ ator Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt in the Swedish bar during the single campaign of women at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman , who won a multi @-@ competition title , and overall the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was in this moment an end .
this success shows her in the same league such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports on new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years as well as 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u b@@ ail@@ on of her said she has been &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a final exam in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not back with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered to be dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , after she won gold and silver in the single @-@ ranking women of women at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday while she served as a retirement party at the farewell party , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although it insi@@ sted on top because of its long departure on the top , never the future is planned , it &apos;s not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which included their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music , to fit the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not acci@@ dental .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gymn@@ asi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man was trained .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competitive competition , a victory that is so long as it wishes .
even when Must@@ af@@ ina did easily lead by two rot@@ ations , the image took up .
pig bal@@ ks and Bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es keeps the world title - listen .
she caught up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig back - and with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground still another .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently when she did her final bitter@@ ness - a pure formula - and tears f@@ lowed on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue el@@ eyel@@ iner , when the vision they described once in their collection book .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capital , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after their soil she threw the audience to K@@ us@@ sh@@ es , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes was dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ ge , the twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new significance in the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in series production at the music shot in the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks in the first series of series of series by Phoenix , while listening to the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a ride , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder would not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ory blow , as the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , that were owned by adult victims .
the officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting in investig@@ ators led the investig@@ ator to become a close look if it is linked to four previous attacks .
all in all , mainly in His@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods were killed seven people within four months and two injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to exp@@ ose the evidence that they have been linked to the conclusion that attacks are linked up and committed by the same killer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised with her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness the police informed that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was exp@@ elled on an empty @-@ up truck a half hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the series production .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ ch@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his retirement , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I made it not .
I don &apos;t create that .
on this I have not let me go .
what is not true at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund she could never know her under certain circumstances and that he may not survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with a help .
Edmund could not sit nor cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year , and he can &apos;t speak .
but he advances slowly .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Edmund for &quot; Please give me something more recently . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring to him the character language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not typical character language -- it says . Edmund invented some characters alone .
Micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or c@@ ik@@ avirus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and projections may vary greatly .
it is too early to say how it will affect the lives of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds himself of the emotional price of a tremendous future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I have been asked for a long time since long time , because I didn &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a promising advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
it will be better .
they know it will be better for you .
they will love your child and your child will love you .
severe rain fail@@ ures , flood exists as b@@ ail@@ out in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency department on Friday . it will count all Saturday above with more rainf@@ alls .

the governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards shared his state official contact with the local authorities and was already on the way to the local authorities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Board &apos;s Office , shared with that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags are multiplied .
ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone had requested tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood control system is used across wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service caused that in this area may drop extra 3 to 5 inches of rain .
in the South of Alabama , a flood system was used on Friday , while the Mobile was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the Com@@ ite River near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which both are located in Louisiana , are all odds over the weekend of record level .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many homes in the presence of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a flood desc@@ ended in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger because these rivers run only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ticket fa@@ v , south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool , Louisiana , arrived at 09.@@ 00 the highest level at the time ever recorded .
rescue teams still meet people from the flood in the district of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were amongst those who were saved on Friday in the near of Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet from his house , is rising rapidly throughout the night .
he said that he would have warned him another step of a step@@ son who lives near .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are guarded and wat@@ ered the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years where she lived there , never had seen such a high level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members could have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that sa@@ vi@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated by Friday .
Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , as it continued heavy rainf@@ alls and that authorities take ev@@ acu@@ ating instructions in consideration .

the authorities issued that heavy rainf@@ alls and floods floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants of their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and in the case of five school@@ mates .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a sub@@ missions in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were now over@@ flowing .
the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller told that the authorities were rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets saved by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set to host the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; once the water starts back , they will return back to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed because of the floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for residents to carry out , the hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last major flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems like a similar incident .
in respect , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison &apos;s not@@ ion that it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday has been reported as over@@ flowing , but on Friday they were not reported until now .
Keith Town@@ son , shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , lives in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; separated by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several shots , including in the lungs , bones , arm and stomach , but that he was in consciousness with his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his small body was removed by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ de@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boys of the boy shared the transmitter , that it is likely to be restored .
he would have the first class to start in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot at German@@ town .
three men were also shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable condition .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds itself in a critical condition , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and police , just under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that apparently it seems to be a cruise between several arch@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ es for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced back to various assault ri@@ ms , over@@ looked the crime scene .
it seems that it was clear for an ongoing struggle .
on the street , on both sides of walking , sleeve .
so it seems to have been here several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; divided the police unit Anthony G@@ inal@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
there were also several homes and vehicles in the area .
there was no feast , and the police re @-@ reviewed reports , according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a leaf@@ let on the arm when she played in front of her house in the West O@@ ak Lane .
it re@@ covers and the police are looking for susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie !
that is what I faced in the gymn@@ as@@ antry in the gymn@@ as@@ antry and that of more than a reason .
first of all , I joined the Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three tur@@ keys , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess , and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ as is round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has strengthened the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , number one was under the female Tur@@ ner@@ inside a Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad and the Americas .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three fold world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was waiting , but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ cul@@ ine rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual campaign event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the tip of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gymn@@ as@@ tics throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison a to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four steps in the team . furthermore , it is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but reality is so that Tur@@ ns become a more expensive Sport and Turner first line in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents , which are intended for training , training , travel clothing , competition , and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in a weal@@ thy suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses , Turner will receive overall training , and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bal@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since she started with the Tur@@ ns .
we have to be inspired to the churches Au@@ n countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a well @-@ less and easily accessible gym .
I founded my Turn@@ cit@@ ement 20 years ago .
with my events we have offered free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15,000 visitors ( mostly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer to the young high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that make the chance to learn from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ acy of mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of the crew , who bring thousands of young girls to interest for the gymn@@ as@@ tics , and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
it &apos;s such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; and thank you for making her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to get healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance of Assi@@ stance would like to organise further strikes after Jeremy Hun@@ ts suggestion rejected
the ministers had hoped that dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance of Assi@@ stance , who voted in a vote , refused him .
in July the Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that N@@ HS was in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the staff and patients .
the first assistance of Assi@@ stance will receive a new contract , which includes changes in night and weekend work to improve maintenance of time times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Commission for Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists revealed the last night in a message with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance of assistance to the proposed contract , especially in particular , to heat up the current staff crisis and it is meant to treat all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in just eight weeks , which still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to solve the disp@@ utes through talks with the government strug@@ gled to participate in the government of resistance , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was what a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt has to act now to raise the up@@ lifting and address the wor@@ r@@ ents of assistance . &quot;
if he did not do this , the assistance of Assi@@ stance has made clear that they are ready to carry out further labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of almost 13.000 rout@@ ines and 100,000 dates before , since nur@@ ses and medical doctors have been involved in order to grant doctors on the strike string .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments to the reform of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to receive a better week re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4.000 assi@@ sts who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called for the assistance of assistance to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour measures will not reach nothing but are already loaded up to the teams and services providers and prepare the patient , nursing and their families are just wor@@ ries , trouble and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the past two months , we talked to the assistant of the Assi@@ stance of the Assi@@ stance and with the Ministry of Health as well as other mini@@ stri@@ es to the concerns about the gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ity and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hopes that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - as an aston@@ ishment , flexibility at training sessions , additional training sessions , mutual recognition of training , training courses , mutual recognition of training , training courses , mutual recognition of the education , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day medication which can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attacks are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 per day medication , after the authorities recommended that more people have to date for a longer period of time .
the ag@@ grav@@ ated medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ulations ( N@@ HS ) recommended a four @-@ year long ing@@ es@@ tion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ulations ( N@@ HS ) recommended a four @-@ year long ing@@ es@@ tion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty materials in the arter@@ ios@@ clerosis .
when the Bel@@ ag dis@@ rup@@ ts , it can cause blood cl@@ ots to clo@@ gged the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots , it can flow through blood flow and clo@@ gged blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack already in a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by reducing the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the design draft of N@@ ICE , which today has been published today , recommends a 12 month ing@@ es@@ tion of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health practition@@ er Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with a disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a temporary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are happy that we are able to expand the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the design bill recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ d@@ ness leaves elec@@ trop@@ hy in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ a Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ g@@ ness has led to that widespread constitu@@ ency was ignored in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles attacks the police , election ob@@ servers , and Rath@@ houses to be ignored in evidence of electoral abuse regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion .
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , which is now an anti @-@ corrupt government , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious moti@@ ves would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish demo@@ li@@ ars outside of constitu@@ encies to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should lead an identification card to prove their identity in the elections .
at the moment , a elec@@ tors have to name only his name and address .
the report suggests , non @-@ remove ink on the finger of one person , if they leave their suff@@ rage to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive greater protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official comp@@ ut@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not only serve against suff@@ rage , but also the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial accounting culture , which thus enters , protect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the reig@@ ning Mayor Lut@@ a Rah@@ man should reveal to a lit@@ te to corrupt and illegal practices of his body .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious emotions of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with r@@ att@@ sm@@ ite and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man should have continued &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ c duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation , when one person cho@@ oses another .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud throughout the country .
he ou@@ sted in particular al@@ ar@@ ming the frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ code - if the elderly members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people , choose one of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the col@@ ds to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , in particular women and young people , in order to choose from the Will of the El@@ derly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or ban@@ glad@@ y background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns ... state institutions such a situation must be ignored because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke out of 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists paper@@ work documents to stop &quot; elec@@ tive re@@ ap . &quot;
the report , which is dra@@ gged to Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the voting list of immigration and social fraud purposes .
options to consider , voters must ask of choice after your identification .
don &apos;t remove ink on the finger of a person as soon as she released their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to make sure they are optional .
a 3 @-@ year @-@ old limitation to applications on an automatic paper@@ work .
ban , that political activists work full fac@@ tions and env@@ elop@@ es of correspondence .
the police give the satisfaction to establish demo@@ li@@ ances around elec@@ ting stations .
an amendment requiring an indictment due to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation due to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( national agency law 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing prohibition on election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure the employees assume that voters go to the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election court has Lut@@ a Rah@@ man and his deputy for the end of a lit@@ te to corrupt and illegal practices as unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in@@ adequate for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the most effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check check@@ box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Town H@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
our country bears the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heir , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and covered spread of electoral fraud and leu@@ g@@ ation of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic Port artists in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are available this week on the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , out of the border and the band , which has proved an impressive double @-@ continu@@ ity of the Duke of Cambridge .
but the 24 year old Olympic champion in this summer is by far not the only one to show Gold fighting Ath@@ let , who has his own famous double lon@@ er - at least not when you give the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ ers in time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olymp@@ ischer &apos;s risks which feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s famous songs .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides K@@ ates double @-@ tra@@ der on the bicycle track , many people on the Internet know how a certain arch@@ et@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a storm on Twitter , after images that he looks like to see the wolf of Wall Street star un@@ cann@@ y .
in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave to that he has already heard his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I feel good as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be present in the center : the apparent simil@@ arity between Britain &apos;s jump Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes is intended to go through the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another compar@@ ative comparison was made between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which has a similar serious eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal guard in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun@@ ning skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the Americans was att@@ acking Adrian Adrian by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only ones : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others are similar to the simil@@ arities .
theory : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple maybe
a Twitter u@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that hope solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .

the comm@@ ent@@ ator of Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was turned off when he flo@@ ats up his own opinion at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ ind@@ le .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the comm@@ ent@@ ators team of C@@ BS on board in order to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be heard : &quot; these little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;

Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; Hat of the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; has died like a pig . &quot; ? ? ?

the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many presented him to speech
Twitter users did not return when they heard how uns@@ ha@@ sty Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you only represent the C@@ BC and Canada and it lets us look like r@@ assi@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance . &quot;
it was an un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation , I &apos;m sorry for it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times by people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC form@@ ulated and added his ap@@ ology at over 90 other Twitter Us@@ be@@ ers who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network exc@@ used too quickly and gave a message .
we regret it right , that these statements were made and that it has been made to be aired .
yesterday , we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for our viewers at the show and our followers in social media .
in order to clari@@ fy one , Byron &apos;s comments relative to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not at them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ed at the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment I made after the women of women in the C@@ BC , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark Emp@@ ars about women trying to check out in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where they should see when a woman went out of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she laugh@@ ed her as she looked therein , and put them back to the shelf .
she cli@@ pped and tried four pairs of sub@@ jection in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back to the shelf .
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she abandoned herself and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales surface they took a pair of sub@@ h@@ osen from the out@@ lay , moved their own streets and tro@@ users , and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even tried to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she was just there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ red when they didn &apos;t like the sub@@ jection again , which she obviously didn &apos;t like to put them back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that her wasn &apos;t pleased to come back and out again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she watched - or about the person who would buy the sub@@ du@@ ous under certain circumstances whom it had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; as to think someone would take a sub@@ jection to the home that had an other person and had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday .
Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to draw the clothes from the sale after she went - what &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sub@@ du@@ es to go home and find out that a different wife had her , and she had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident that occurred on Tuesday August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com may make it a safer place for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to walk down with armed thi@@ efs at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind it will show you this video as you turn the sk@@ ewers for your rob@@ ber .
when you cross it from behind , you should turn yourself as a path@@ way , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and sit &quot; out of the line &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat it with your free ell@@ bow .
then strike him with the kne@@ e into the chest , and turn down , while the att@@ ack@@ ers spread before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run and move backward , while they set the weapon on him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and rotate them , so that the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
put the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers to the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip , before they move backward and make the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it turns Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is in a rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est part , your money - as long as you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eler Ian Wright for a guide his tongue on the dirty places in Europe
a British trav@@ eler under@@ nourished his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex a serious test - by taking some of the dirt and most spectacular places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk , put his wake up on a Euro @-@ loop , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , an rinse kno@@ b of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before deduc@@ ting every object , he used a lumin@@ ous plant to show and show us what it is settled .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought , the fl@@ ing kno@@ b of a pull @-@ out shit , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists on promoting intestinal bacteria and his own health .
fortunately , nothing left , what he le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste of the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to fl@@ avo@@ ids of toilets , the task assigned to his immune system definitely under a rehear@@ sal
in the film he told : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slaughter . &quot;
in the film he was definitely just a righteous reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its test scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ om@@ eter@@ isation of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ates fresh hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leave , after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ m was over 4000 units , whereas freshly used hands have a less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the worst thing I have ger@@ minated in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no dirt as that !
I &apos;ll do nothing here , because it is in@@ geni@@ ous here .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ d .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ d Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics explains .
we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings which ended that we told &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in health health is a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday area , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon , and with this documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say , &quot; I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he would have tasted some of the things I would have directed to him , just like the tiny Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things easier to bring Ian to get rid of them and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats in film . &quot;
in a survey conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of respondents were associated with lac@@ tic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain lac@@ tic acid bacteria .

T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from the property , shocked employees of the housing co@@ operative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls referred k@@ la@@ sty holes , wooden sticks were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor , scattered and gra@@ ff@@ iti was ador@@ ned to the walls .
the family has been moved and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the home administration in Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would not be rep@@ airing the apartment anymore .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , because this estate is probably considered not as beautiful part Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had added the family , street fighting with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ish , in@@ timi@@ date of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drugs and excessive scre@@ ams .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be demolished under certain circumstances , old garbage was found
in the estate , in which past drugs have been tra@@ ded , the wooden floors were torn ,
neighbors said they had batt@@ led them out on the streets and to perio@@ dic@@ ate the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ etes it and her partner these week for@@ ci@@ bly from the estate after they gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ eting were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbors , saying that their life was made to hell .
one said of them : &quot; they were not ashamed . &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep today . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not always !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would love the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long
garbage and old toys were thrown on the transferred page of the municipal house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it sow@@ ed the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ eting is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is taking into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be horri@@ ble for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community , who have gone bold to us and have received the information they have made .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbours , and convey@@ s the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delay on the ground .
workers from the house management are now destroyed garbage cans , surrounded the house
in 2014 , the police introduced a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis and scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after she found himself guilty of the possession of a drug class B in commercial view .
she claimed that money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
having gone without shelter , T@@ anya and her partners are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ti@@ zed with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police states that they will del@@ ate ten@@ ants , who do not keep to the house order
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall police informed that the del@@ eting is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not keep to the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ sealing , as well as those who were killed by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our churches .

Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ huge problems ″ on election campaign
the leadership of US Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional conservative federal states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump had now weak@@ ened the weak@@ nesses of his campaign in the previous republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Utah .
a very rare moment in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire have expressed as some concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after he threw 16 rival in his own republi@@ can camp from the race , now the doubt of his success is growing in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for assistance in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to blame are false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can high bur@@ dens
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ s from June to June were admitted to Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor by the Democrats , Hillary Clinton .
other institutes may see tr@@ ump on the front , but not with the distance that are common for Republican candidate in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview of the Senate CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wants to stop the rise of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
and if you follow : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t do anything else to tell &quot; the truth . &quot;
if there is no need for him on the end of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is OK , &quot; Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the press reports , the party should be threatened to submit money to the support of its electoral campaign , he should present no better survey values .
instead of receiving the candidates of Republi@@ cans for Congress stronger among the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ster fraud on d@@ oping test
the IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the event .
Ken@@ ner athletes threat@@ ens after the second d@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
after an attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee met with , immediately a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
the Ken@@ yan func@@ tionary had been informed that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village , had a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ L@@ äu@@ ble F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this is the team @-@ leading Ken@@ ias from D@@ oping control devices .
the IA@@ AF world association has received the IOC for information about the case to encourage their investigations , shared an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will carry an evaluation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called it in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the d@@ oping control station and has been issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample returned and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the ac@@ credi@@ tation of the athl@@ ete who stood on the list for the training controls in the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was sold in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
four days earlier the Ken@@ yan Athletics Men &apos;s Leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he should have informed about money @-@ payments of his country on upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he reportedly been arrested in Nairobi at his return .
Kenya has already been under a special observation at the IOC for numerous d@@ oping tests .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping target check in front of the Rio Games before the Rio Olympics was previously noted that athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the visa .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency had a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law passed a few weeks before Olympic start .
as a result , the W@@ A@@ DA Kenya took part of the list of countries whose d@@ oping control con@@ formity with the rules of W@@ A@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of tel@@ ev@@ isions of the ARD , ARD has been raised again , so that in Kenya d@@ oping means are easily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
the IOC member , Richard Po@@ und called for a similar study in Kenya , as he had raised her in the Russian Athletics Championships .
could be proven that in this sport is widespread and systematically hired in this sport field .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival plays the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a portable family , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with us a surprising c@@ Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical won in Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the classical temple and filled with the role of Maria a youth mare .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted her conductor Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older brother .
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ ol@@ y on her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because she is extraordinary !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she says in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ eds Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ eds Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is so clever , of course nai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resem@@ bles me very much , my Italian character I have known as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bag@@ amel is full of lob@@ es for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it &apos;s such an honor to us with her .
she is a terrible man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in any of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a joy@@ ful approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all !
for the American filmmaker Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; highly @-@ up : &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ smus .
today , we did the refugees at that time the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as well @-@ speaking as it then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and died after the family of her family shortly after she had to leave the war of war and to return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are connected to go into a war zone - people think to meet this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school students come from the east of London into a plane towards Turkey and subsequently into a bus to the Syrian border .
the sul@@ tan@@ as family has been told that they had married ISIS fighters in Syria - and was a widow within a few months .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of assurance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but instead of famous cra@@ cker people want to find them for the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 .
the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Shaw told us early this year that his neck @-@ magazine from Old@@ school player is distingu@@ is@@ hable , as &quot; Playboy for Men was . &quot;

apparently he is the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to return to the representation time of tim@@ eless and classic nu@@ dity with which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shaw said in a press release to release the Cal@@ endars . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass cur@@ s@@ akes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is engaged in packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in short term , the Kurdish town@@ ship in Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of prot@@ esters that fled from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Verb@@ and@@ s@@ ander Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard advance of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish church of Germany anticip@@ ates a mass curse to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium term with some hundreds of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime fights the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the Chair Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the World &quot; from Friday .
because the government had passed over the months of Kurdish high @-@ bur@@ sts with criminal justice , 500,000 Kurds are on their run in Turkey .
after the failed put@@ sch still sa@@ cular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks were added .
many will start in Europe when they are re@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that takes refuge in his own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of head compl@@ ained the targeted appeal of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities .
Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were already eradi@@ cated in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president demanded that the federal government is &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the fire market as Gü@@ len @-@ tra@@ ilers destroys teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is engaged in packed suit@@ cases , by the way the K@@ em@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chair of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the paper reported on the numbers of the German Ministry of Agriculture , the Turks already set up the largest group based on political persecution in Germany because of political persecution in Germany .
as of June 30 , this is 11 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all eligible asylum request ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , not the war , poverty or perspectives are re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated .
asylum seek@@ ers after the Basic Law are exclusively political , so by governmental site , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not receive anything from the Summer Choice campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
by 2021 the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the s@@ atin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and country sw@@ inging - that bit@@ es .
the locals who are to be convinced by the elec@@ ts are on vacation .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers , who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen , or Hid@@ den@@ see are not objec@@ tors , so don &apos;t choose the Land@@ tag .
there will be practical problems : in the holidays , the hel@@ pers will hang up , the posters will spread , fl@@ yers , and spread out at the end of the vote , only m@@ üh@@ ev@@ oll .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to wait for a campaign close to the people .
the hot phase when you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
it is exciting how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing is to cut Af@@ ro , and what remains at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age , and since 2008 , head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees his large posters .
he travels across the country , spread ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , just as it did his most legendary Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors have cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Merkel over@@ threw the debt on the blo@@ om of Af@@ ro .
their refugee policy , you &quot; We do this &quot; have accelerated the rise of the pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office now .
the CDU with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make a wrong place at the right place of election campaign .
she has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel to big search for Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Nor@@ theast Latvia .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Sax@@ onia in Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to listen to Germany from other corners of Germany , even Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the nor@@ theastern CDU disp@@ oss@@ essed largely to the usual election events on market places and before shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
this means Kok@@ ert , plays only one &quot; minor role . &quot;
the Union also noted that , on the country , it has marked the base that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any of the country in the country .
however , the Council of the CDU election campaign Kok@@ ert to his fellow soldier is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; they must go there where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
because there is a lot in the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign .
in p@@ olls , S &amp; D Group recently stood at 22 percent behind partner &apos;s CDU ( 25 ) and only just ahead of the Af@@ ro ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD won still clearly with 3@@ 5.6 percent ahead of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small party of seven per cent in the p@@ olls , will probably do the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtu@@ e from the holiday , and put up their campaign on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; calls the state of Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green elec@@ tive war@@ riors on track search for native voting rights among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and also finds it beautiful .

at speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
for those responsible for the construction work that start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end up at 20 o &apos;clock , there are always enth@@ r@@ alled praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything quite nice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no default .
at the end of October , the construction site was scheduled to be transferred to the south , until the end of October everything should be finished .
this is also praised for the construction work , about when it comes to the establishment of containers .
since the construction site opened on Monday to the south and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ y@@ road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is once again , the traffic situation is relaxed within the resort .
the citizens can now drive on both sides by O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the road traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partially significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says that responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment , vice director Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local residents of Bach &apos;s street , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had sought to fight more traffic noise , because many shots were sought and rather than the signs .
in addition , what led to some other truck in residential areas .
since the speed limit has not been kept , the community demanded the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable exagger@@ ations , &quot; says King , who made himself a position on the situation .
there are already two to three per minute .
the fastest speed was 77 km / h in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small sol@@ ace that for customers coming from Rot@@ tenburg now the street is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 over@@ h@@ aul has led to revenues in revenues , each one wonders to look through .
however , some more and some are less affected .
who , with the &quot; final customers &quot; less to do , i.e. , produced for other companies , has hardly any consequences for the rehabilitation .
even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most light decline , &quot; but she also dreamed of course . &quot;
the most heavily exploited is the local street along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all guest houses have met &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers are missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it depends on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sales catalog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road appearances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took his operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to put half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , gover@@ ning President Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there might be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant pro@@ filed otherwise by the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it also needs the dis@@ advantages associated with the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous was handled .
with all plum@@ ages , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history of history .
that other regular guests are now less subject to less than the complicated traffic , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is elsewhere beautiful .
his pedi@@ gre@@ tion returned to the end of the renovation work again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
in the name of terror control , laws have been screw@@ ed to laws .
after the recent attacks , the Minister of Home de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
all his proposals are politically vulnerable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security packages .
they don &apos;t ask anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also participated in that .
but as the Minister of Interior , however , he was situated to results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the coalition .
according to recent attacks in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach , Mai@@ zi@@ ère took a little time , before he presents his conclusions to the security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announce that a new safety agency should take care of the Kn@@ itting encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU direc@@ tives for passenger data and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second start for proposals that had not yet been to the SPD : he wants sympathy for terror groups under punishment and kne@@ ad jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grants the CDU man dre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still hold this for reasonable and demanding nothing , whatever the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists have anyway no chance .
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they are partly in itself : he plans rapid procedures for shifts and more possibilities for the detention of people in front of deportation .
refugees who are fet@@ ched specifically to the country should check their smartphones and create social media accounts for a security check in advance .
in Dul@@ ces for expired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than ever - such , those who commit crimes or modify their papers to make their identity .
some of them is political and legal .
some people still seems un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - at the im@@ balance of growth in Ged@@ ali@@ ens for example - the question arises : what does that have to do with safety and terrorism ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people were worried about the high refugee numbers .
and things that have deeply impressed people , they were unable to compl@@ ain , even in election campaign times .
inner security is enor@@ m@@ ously ind@@ ented in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the security is great .
and yes , there are electoral struggles .
in the context of internal security , Union and SPD are therefore increasingly taking place in position .
in the past days , the two parties went up .
only a gar@@ sti@@ ger dispute over the equipment of the federal police , then via a security policy collection of some of the Interior Minister , in which the res@@ ent@@ ment also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a turn from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère m@@ ishes here for the reconc@@ iling sounds .
from a turn of the double pass he holds nothing .
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
they re@@ locate , don &apos;t make sense .
and by a Bur@@ ka ban , he is constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is constitu@@ ent on all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partners , it must first show .
there is a lot of things that could help fight .
but the SPD is now trying to trust himself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ n@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel signals only a cau@@ tious conversation and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes , to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen gets worse yet .
despite the diesel sub@@ missions , the delivery figures are sold worldwide .
but it is not running in all markets .
in the recall , there are verteb@@ ra@@ e around a term .
Volkswagen launches the second half in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car driver can continue to increase a plus .
but in July , the core brand was weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and loaded the overall sales of sales , such as the Da@@ x recorded company .
in July , the VW brand sold more than 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year .
in the home market Germany , deliveries around almost one sixth .
market leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann made the weak@@ est figures back from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets , there have been a department store due to &quot; modified economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote also stressed the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the emission of exhaust gas is first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected number of household in Lower Saxony will continue to decline through the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only an extradition minus 0.9 per cent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles comes to be@@ ech .
consolidated division Fred Kap@@ pler could refer to a sales designation from January to July .
Volkswagen has delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time , globally 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software gas tests .
in Germany alone , Volkswagen is calling about 2.5 million vehicles to re@@ armament into the workshops .
in re@@ armament , VW re@@ iter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the upgrade of the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine capacity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus station controls the customer following the re@@ armament of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason be legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports , Volkswagen will give up his German customers a guarantee for sc@@ aff@@ able diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on the last Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ ative of the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that this meeting existed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has the editions of my inquiry and the KBA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; variations of these are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry .
VW guarantees the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine capacity , according to the re@@ armament , have no wor@@ sen@@ ing , and all typical approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen fore@@ sees the possibility of making customers a half year after the upgrade around with an engine damage to a workshop - and this can lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in customer interests it is important to avoid that in any other damages , they have nothing to do with the removal scandal , as it was called .
that is why we don &apos;t use the concept &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal interest - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank@@ rupt@@ cy Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers that park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or day money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks talks about a single fall and does not see a signal : normal savings should not be afraid to pay for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have to store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) for money at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) .
this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers to deposits over 100,000 euros on po@@ ro@@ - or daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been spending 40 million euros for the time that could be lifted from one day to the other , and could not be confused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me in the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every one million euros . &quot;
he continued the costs after the delay in principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply lie in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it would have been too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank stand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and altern@@ ate to other forms of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co@@ operative federation declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you alone bear to wear is &quot; operational permanently not possible . &quot;
hence , some German banks have increased their fees to account , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian National and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land has made headlines from three million euros in 2014 with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch office in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief of the banking Federation , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private clients to pay attention to in@@ sol@@ es for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks have much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , At T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a cli@@ ffs who has a little sum@@ p@@ tuous from wealth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a small bank for the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gs , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
famous actor , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co@@ operative Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no further banks known , who charge an output rate for deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s Banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the threshold into the negatives , compared to the private customers , is very , very high . &quot;

destination records : who does actually buy records ?
lon@@ ely men love plates .
before you hur@@ ry to inform him under the p@@ seud@@ onym @-@ Al@@ le@@ Ein@@ sam@@ en@@ men &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the complex reconstruction of records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to greet the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but due to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record , are all the fore@@ sight after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely K@@ äu@@ ble group .
it is also not hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older flat runners keep their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ als agree ?
if this blog was a news report on TV I would follow me the camera while I stand in am@@ id@@ st a busy street in Soh@@ o , a humble grey suit , and make it wild , before I stand up , keep my hands and a certain determin@@ ism of how : &quot; so let &apos;s throw a look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os slowly hang@@ s at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent vend@@ ors were located - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman , to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight men middle ages , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops around the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 and 4,000 plates .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t followed him home ) , put the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy records , which he could not afford , when she was released and again buying items that he was sold when he was young and ple@@ xed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are of the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably came too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is true to those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my button .
We@@ z , 25 who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many customers that will meet You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also has a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback to buy their old records .
of the conversations that I have led , people usually have defended themselves so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records back again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to the att@@ achments of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that record stores are a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ in@@ ders .
according to We@@ z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of trusted records from objects , of objects that are happy ju@@ gen@@ ders alert .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; We@@ z says .
that &apos;s me as collectors and I think it &apos;s so many people so .
it is a simple way to deal with spirit@@ ually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have a staff from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who have purchased a record last month they haven &apos;t listened to .
the pol@@ l also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy one plate , have no turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while I bl@@ amed through a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data of data : three men middle age ) works , has a &quot; trop@@ hy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came in front of us here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Schall@@ platte , so I &apos;d like to buy them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it &apos;s definitely going .
more productive , less musicians .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who first come slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has an evil audience when I go clean .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ agers and women middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thesi@@ ze and sex@@ ter pop rather than experimental jazz . it is good to see such di@@ vers@@ ität in the customer .
none of them looks strange , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard @-@ determined if one stands for about 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for some minutes in business , and considers the variety of plates for sale .
it rather makes a man@@ ne@@ quin as a big one .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so the collecting of records is no real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from one computer or another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I admit the je@@ ans to mu@@ gs the je@@ ans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young girls who group themselves at a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left is a stair@@ case , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics which are essential plates for an average collection .
nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far in the top that it is impossible to put it on .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , also that is the most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they let them , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers , which exist in reality , record stores and in On@@ line@@ age .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the b@@ um@@ meln by record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and leaves through plates , while she cat@@ ches the ga@@ ze of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who asc@@ ends about the shoulders above @-@ standing men aged middle ages .

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the refugee camp refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a trial hearing this week , the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should tear down 72 mak@@ es@@ hi@@ res businesses , selling hair services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argued that these places should be destroyed , because they would represent a parallel economy , which would not be paid for tax and risk of fire @-@ risk .
humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the temporary shops and restaurants are often offering accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary business , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are absolutely im@@ measur@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants are a much larger role to live when only people live in extremely pre@@ valent conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of tran@@ qui@@ l meeting between refugees and volunteers are offering .
one of the places that was threatened by defe@@ ats was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , the most commonly used and 200 meals a day , English and French classes and a consultation of asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable individuals , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of whom the youngest eight years old are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants were estimated to have risen to more than 9.000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers in the summer .

here comes the en@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation of vel@@ ocity mode : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Temp@@ os@@ cop@@ ier should be particularly effective .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic en@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden may be used for example to accident points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary pace , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary gl@@ itter for compliance with speed limit .
a lasting mobile installation can be too dangerous or war@@ dly .
the en@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data will be transmitted via a modem .
in addition , with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be detected simultaneously through multiple tracks .
variable speed limit , as well as drive verb@@ s to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also monitor .
in high @-@ speed condition one can move the tra@@ ilers with any car with a trailer hook .
that it is not easy to look at , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the pan@@ icked , and by the way , will van@@ ish .
a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
there are also foreign authorities with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain fet@@ ch silver in the 7 @-@ man ru@@ g@@ by , after the Master@@ class Gold gets
the impressive performance of Britain during the 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came to a corrupt hold at the last hur@@ dle at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
in Fiji a master class in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , cr@@ ut@@ ches , line @-@ up and raw strength to win gold - the first Olympic Medal of each color .
the defeat was disp@@ at@@ ched by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of silver medal - Britain fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall in the final .
but independently of this , in this form a 15 @-@ man team would have been defeated in top shape .
it could be a consol@@ ation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite will hang a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former chef for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind him .
eight years ago she was lost under Ryan each game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they only lost one thing .
this folder will hurt , but the progress is ast@@ o@@ unding .
in Fiji , wonderful and left the attacks GB@@ S from fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was in the corner .
with only four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly did the ball .
a hand@@ some T@@ ackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate , but in Fiji it only stopped .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua sat down a Touch@@ down corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new time since the restart , and there was still about a minute play@@ time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ paid further weak tac@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is so , when Fiji was born to play the 7 , while Britain has still been there .
this is how it is .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and ended the fi@@ ji@@ lian gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua tou@@ red Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant stop@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favour of the South se@@ sul@@ tians , whose fans sang and d@@ anced and d@@ anced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame replaced the i @-@ dot with another attempt in recent seconds .
whi@@ stle the whi@@ stle , Fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished and GB f@@ aked in the lawn .
early on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a bald @-@ fin@@ ite match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half past , but Dan N@@ orton took the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the position in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony des English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the struggle with cancer &apos;s cancer
there will be no bi@@ ologic gold as with these games , and that wants to be hot .
from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was omni@@ present as they were in the second Olympics without tax woman in succession , the first women in the history of the British sports , which had such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least her 3@@ 9.@@ ter not lag@@ ged , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ que@@ ens , leading over the surface with the elegance of gay , which is not reflected in the kind of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
behind every gold in the rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on to content that make the difference , and there was no one more helpful than the coach who didn &apos;t know if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had the bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did so .
if you do not do that , he spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a quite aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that it could be the treatment beginning in 2014 , outside the season , which could begin the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the correct term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ entive .
I stayed at the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
the rowing to itself is already a challenge , but that makes it a bigger one .
in the in@@ ability of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a more annoying morning to talk something more than otherwise , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , the cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it meant so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only repeated how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore we are a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person for coaching or better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the past 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to join , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were really caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , lead in the trial . &quot;
it is really important to ri@@ p itself .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for doing something great .
we wanted to do no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions on his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding next week , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
exempl@@ ary for 31 years of clarity
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose group , &quot; V@@ eit@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian potential . &quot;
a small drinking water @-@ purpose association with the role model for the great water manufacturer .
some time ago , it was called the original part of the Bavarian Radio .
little later the water@@ forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken adopted the Pur@@ pose Association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ t group did &quot; Bavaria far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller , which was 31 years in the Pur@@ pose Association , of which 28 years were the manager .
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose group with headquarters in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , Breit@@ brunn , is funding a year about 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 places and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants .
member communities are the communities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
for more cities and municipalities there are water suppliers .
the current chair@@ woman , Wi@@ fer@@ ns Citiz@@ ens in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller was set as a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed as the managing director of the Pur@@ pose Association in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks are very diverse and they continued to work by the water management and maintenance work about office and organisation activities , the budget plan , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency notes on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ person .
as an outstanding events they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new w@@ ells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , re@@ covering of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the divi@@ ding of water pipes .
there was no breast@@ feeding and I &apos;ve always been added to innovations , because water was de@@ part@@ mental and drinking water to be the most important food .
in their Lau@@ d@@ atio they praised G@@ ö@@ ller , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has used himself with a lot of heart suits for his water@@ purpose and he has lived the water @-@ purpose @-@ association as it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he is a real practition@@ er to present the success concept for nit@@ rate con@@ ges@@ tion to nit@@ rate con@@ ges@@ tion in front of the water@@ forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken District .
he has received much recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller , on the one hand praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a loyal Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the Pur@@ pose Association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult application , however , were the pipe at the reservoir near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work through , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn also maintained only once , because you filled the tanks of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sl@@ ums .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who will succeed Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ cher@@ ko is open to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago , and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Sera &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease was diagnosed with her son , they believed that they had to die .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and declared to have shot his life partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator was on the run , after him , I will be publicly d@@ led .
by now , Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a gl@@ at@@ cher .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
there is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man we@@ ars a gl@@ at@@ cher .
man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with themselves , so the police .
whoever sees Sven S. , should call the 110 .
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship at . &quot;
the sacrifice was born 1988 , the perpet@@ rators 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but it confirmed that a human being killed .
&quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say more at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police raid in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - light view for German steel industry
the risk @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains un@@ affected by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the industry from the green power supply , are of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there remain in the liberation of renewable energies to the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ service production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West German General Newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really glad that we were able to finally reach the negotiations for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission originally planned to use the steel manufacturer , the gases coming from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption , to ask for cash .
the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic certificate with the European Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators in the steel works will be replaced , an EEG lev@@ y fall by 20 percent .
but even this will not be collected in the steel industry .
the IG Metall had welcomed the agreement in Germany with the EU Commission for the creation of self @-@ creation .
this is why the status quo has largely been recorded by the current regulation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even on the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and significant pricing pressure since the financial crisis of 2008 .
last year , the situation intensi@@ fied , as the world &apos;s largest producer in China , considering the weak@@ ening domestic demand , cast steel to the world market .
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel concerts pricing d@@ umping .
over this spring , the situation has relaxed .
for a show , import tari@@ ffs on imported effects , for others , the economic outlook in China has hung up .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ m Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained cau@@ ti@@ ously on Thursday .
most recently the prices were more stagn@@ ant .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp had also not intended to exclu@@ de lock@@ ers from single plants .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturer remain cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , like the steel Association of Steel on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the volume returned to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is increased by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association anticip@@ ates an increasing output in the coming months thanks to an improved job basis .
community , Spirit , health : singing senior citizens
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , teaching the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings among a senior citizen .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels un@@ balanced , cheerful and more living , says she .
besides , she does something good in her health and spirit .
because singing is like a great hobby for seniors , Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German retirement league .
most senior citizens sing in choir and share the joy of music , describing H@@ ac@@ kler .
under the peri@@ odic interaction , seniors , social contacts can follow and maintain .
for frequently , social and family structures are frequently solved , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be st@@ ress@@ ful in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler writes .
as a result , senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled resp@@ i@@ ration .
whoever calls his lungs regularly , is not so fast in daily life .
even though it is about getting the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the national labour community of the Seniors organizations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher position , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people have ar@@ ous@@ ed many memories , often associated with positive feelings of her youth .
by lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , people themselves de@@ men@@ stru@@ ed themselves de@@ men@@ stru@@ ed people in long lying events .
when singing the head a special achievement is required , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time concentrate on their own voice and to concentrate on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cog@@ nitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone are not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one finds through the singing in choir writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ este@@ em is also growing through the singing in choir .
to show yourself : if I am long for something , I &apos;m getting better and wa@@ xed about me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even when he thinks , little talent is advis@@ able .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ ful people who can hear when some sound goes next to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , senior citizens offer various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
someone sing from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in an retirement choir , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leaders .
many senior cho@@ irs also take place on the Internet .
if you have no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet re@@ cher@@ che .
everyone who lust has to sing , should be connected to a choir , betra@@ ys H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a tom@@ cat on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the calls of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys has grown to adult animals .
to their surprise , the male was not cold , however , they beha@@ ved in the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the ar@@ cher@@ y of cat &apos;s bab@@ ys at the mi@@ ster of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on foli@@ age of k@@ itt@@ ens which are in great need , as scientists have found out of the Hanover Medical School and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also respond to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always equal .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between mi@@ sts of less and strongly er@@ ra@@ zed young for the males either not per@@ cep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
it is the first author@@ itative study published in this Friday in the professional journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already figured out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams diff@@ ers with the dr@@ um@@ ness of their assistance .
a total of nine adult male and eight female specimens were observed from the MH@@ H livestock hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a har@@ p of little ones , which were taken from the Wur@@ f@@ box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to the other , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the low sample for sa@@ wing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they swi@@ vel faster to the loud@@ speaker , when this ro@@ cker played the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise that the males have acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
also , some studies showed that women were sensitive to nursing homes , regardless of whether they were mothers , or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ dule .
Po@@ dol@@ ski runs with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r .

after the coup attempt in Turkey , an important soccer game will take place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
already in the case of admission to the uprising in July , the government , daily life of norm@@ alities should not be imp@@ aired .
this does not apply to those who are suspected to address the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
the football doesn &apos;t halt before the football .
the Prosecutor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
according to the meantime , the South of America is accused of being a terrorist group of terrorist attacks in America .
Sü@@ me@@ r is said to be tra@@ ilers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is made responsible for the President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan to the coup attempt .
although the first state of emergency for 90 days is still valid until October , actually this has the life of most Turks , but as good as no imp@@ lications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places in the whole country Erdo@@ gan declared on Wednesday forever . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split in supporters and opponents of the Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the labour club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not count towards the friends of the President .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks became in the history of dramatic experiences in history , the strict re@@ jection of military coup .
even the fans even agree - whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ sieger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be particularly welcome to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne value shown its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first time as a Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 @-@ winner .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; asked him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he has completed the season in an outstanding way and secured the trop@@ hy in his team .
thanks &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; found the dis@@ appointing season to record a reconc@@ iling season .
after round @-@ kno@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; say too early in the Europa League early .
in the South by Li@@ g , it was only rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the trop@@ hy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas playing the game year better .
mainly thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who served with 26 seasonal spots as the South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Li@@ g @-@ go@@ z@@ ny , the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , when the AC Florence had announced under the contract , and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas , Gom@@ ez has announced only to return to the coup attempt to return for the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only must say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have to be willing to aband@@ on some one @-@ third of its worth 7.5 million euros per year , or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary at Florence may not pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa cannot start in Rio .
other athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at all - they are fighting in Rio around medals .
the topic D@@ oping is determined after the headlines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had surrendered to a d@@ oping lock on their grid shortly before the games , was p@@ ected in their start ( 100 meters of breast ) mer@@ cil@@ essly p@@ aus@@ ed and hat@@ ched .
there was a sk@@ ur@@ le Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a su@@ peri@@ ed smile , she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked with their appearance .
as a fir@@ mer that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a storm .
but there are numerous other athletes who go to the Rio Olympics in spite of the d@@ oping past .
here an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had been locked two times for d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
since his career , the Olympic champion from 2004 and Ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is ranked number one in the world in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenge of Us@@ ine Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after taking the intake of the pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she defended a strong tooth pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion from 2013 and European Championship was tested positive to the forbidden stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the ignor@@ ance and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est thro@@ ws walk this year to the account of the great gold fav@@ or@@ tin .
La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive and closed 21 months in 2010 .
a means to penis enlargement was responsible , beg@@ ged Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 metres of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ard , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athletes have been recognized as many medals .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after it was diagnosed with testosterone di@@ oping .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to release Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM title in 2006 due to testosterone mis@@ use .
the 2008 Olympic Games was also recognized as a bronze medal at the CA@@ S International Sports Tribunal .
he is ranked 3rd in the world ranking with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 metres .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May but may nevertheless start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year old world champion in the matter of taking an banned food supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency W@@ A@@ DA fell mild and ran on 13 July .
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian woman viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man for the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
they have suffered chi@@ ve and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left this again .
she planned her hom@@ ebo@@ und tour in early September .
whether further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Phu@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also an Austrian citizen , is still un@@ clear .
the Department of Foreign Affairs arise in a stable contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the Bangkok of Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Nightlife .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ change was killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian woman , three Germans , three Dut@@ chman and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two sp@@ it@@ ud@@ inal approaches went up , while another man was killed , according to the authorities .
the bomb explosion was also reported by Phu@@ ket in the morning .
at the Det@@ onation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong was injured after police data a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded .
according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et before the territory of the coast , the explo@@ iters went into air in front of the territory .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations requested in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
they go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bom@@ bers carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army @-@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday night before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself on possible moti@@ ves - but probably the actions of Muslim rebels are likely .
Thai media also wanted to recognize patterns in the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist movement , or with the international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok .
rather , it is possible that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities have received the upcoming p@@ olls in the south of the country in recent days - but they were not informed about the exact date and the locations .
it is still un@@ clear , which group behind the trap corner .
the police informed their officials across the country to rein@@ force safety around major government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and pleasure hosting .
in Thailand there are increasingly smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not direct to tourists .
in Hua H@@ in there is a palace that was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to reason @-@ based bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends its homepage , the statements of the Thai security authorities to make a result .
high security risk ( level 3 ) sailed for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim nations , no necessary travel in these provinces are dis@@ sec@@ eded .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday turned a few days after a disputed referendum on one by the military jun@@ ta .
this grants the military influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said the bombs are an attempt to sti@@ cking chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , believes himself to have stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip in the extreme south of the country , in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict more than 6@@ 500 people were killed .
almost one year ago in Bangkok in a attack on a popular Hind@@ u @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody attack in the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; identi@@ fying movement &quot; is taken into the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
according to several provincial governments , the Con@@ trol@@ zer in the Con@@ federation has also set the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; Identity movement &apos; for efforts against the freedom of democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ use in extrem@@ ist ways .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; Identi@@ fication Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and &quot; the loss of identity of its own identity . &quot;
in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , its authority voted in deci@@ ding closely with the states .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identity movement &apos; try to collect their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to pron@@ ounce them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the entities Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extremis@@ m .
that is not a praying advertising for his own cause .
propaganda is supposed to talk emotional .
young people are in a special way .
this is dangerous .
last &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , it had given reports about contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ ro @-@ politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , he has no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a point of point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , changes their targets and will be so extrem@@ ist .
so , consequently , whether such persons have remote influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the significant increase of justi@@ fi@@ Fourth crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee quot@@ ations , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have found that there may be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there were &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Freit@@ al Group .
it can certainly be that further righ@@ tist groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extremis@@ m .
a clear or pan @-@ wide control of rec@@ ital ism is but not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not worry about that many over@@ s walked on the account of people who have not entered into the right scene in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the Tat@@ suspected attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes committed by right @-@ wing extremis@@ m , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or left , who then have radic@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extremis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic Games or world records determine the headlines from the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ looked s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that it was no longer able to see in the TV images .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te then became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure , which attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old took part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international bu@@ oy@@ ancy chamber .
this is distributed to making swimming in sub @-@ presented countries .
because in Eth@@ op@@ ia most athletes are running , I just wanted to do something else .
preparation for all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name took the lap .
some media listed him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
the English tab@@ loid The Sun , with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od , &quot; made him funny for him .
his time , he only hit a minute and almost five seconds ahead of the 100 @-@ meter release , played no part .
compare with &quot; Eric the eel &quot; have also been dra@@ gged .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the tour from the equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea @-@ Guinea , when he had to compete over 100 meters of hands alone .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically was fired at the time Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was then fired .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before the Olympic and had never completed a long distance before the contest .

p@@ ump doesn &apos;t look so narrow the im@@ min@@ ed election situation
the Republican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks on a election campaign in Florida .
should it be done with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already got an alternative video .
he then moves on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it would be either open to him , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if there is no need for him on the end of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is OK , &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
thus he described the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance were formed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring is still not seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every participant will be un@@ steady at some point .

two of the passengers suffered serious injuries , par@@ ted the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old woman of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach needed to express their information according to an opposite number , which was partly on the train .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman by the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the passengers .
six life@@ jacket and a staff car came to the accident on the state road . 2 .
the last trav@@ eler were brought back from a regular service bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .

the fees per cubic se@@ wage is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will be increased by then , if appropriate improvement is needed .
after a relevant calculation , the se@@ wage price in A@@ zo@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found in the approval of the budget by the Land@@ lord of Kul@@ mb@@ ach that work on these se@@ wage plants .
the Kas@@ endorf Market is obliged to operate priv@@ ilege due to legal principles .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to descend deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt was on the board , was one of the charges for the se@@ wage treatment of the market .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ heating and covers from the previous calendar period are expected .
at all three se@@ wage increase , Schmidt thus established that there are relatively small facilities with a very small se@@ wer@@ age , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the small distribution basis , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs were carried out of several thousand Euros .
moreover , the se@@ wage treatment in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , during all three plants , during all three plants , more recently , due to their age , san@@ itation and repair applications are fallen in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp .
Schmidt showed that in the se@@ wage plant in A@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl the almost 20 years old support systems had to be over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed and at the pond water level , after almost 20 years of operation the first sep@@ tic pond had to be incorporated into the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge and to keep an additional ventilation system to keep the water @-@ legal specifications in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expendi@@ tures , the continued serv@@ icing and maintenance costs came into account according to the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were significantly below the current level in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear that at the low se@@ wage plant in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully sm@@ ashing . &quot;
furthermore , Schmidt has retained the market community of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plant in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ ari@@ ous after the view of stone houses in duration , especially since you could not be able to expand the supply area of the waste association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al in order to be able to expand this facilities , because there are de@@ fied facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian caric@@ ature critic@@ ises
snap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is not ensi@@ tive towards races .
with its filter tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and with identi@@ ties such a way that already borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a character that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are uns@@ hi@@ med , self @-@ oriented tools which generate more than 30 million improved bl@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ er@@ ings arrive to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past that they were accused of having to propag@@ ate the app Black@@ face @-@ related or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week , some us@@ ur@@ ers hit a filter , which gave them sl@@ ashing , false teeth and ar@@ ous@@ ed che@@ eks , called there some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ly . &quot;
they asked whether these repeated controversy raised up a larger problem , that the company has Di@@ verse .
the news and indig@@ nation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ standing , which have experienced r@@ att@@ sm , the filter remin@@ ded of inf@@ rin@@ gement c@@ lich@@ és .

Snap@@ chat is not the only company that this cultural Stol@@ per@@ ate crossed .
American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment , which we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - those in the race , as their older def@@ enders are - could rather go out to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , &quot; so it is much more difficult for users to stay un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineering in the medium to delete your Snap@@ chat account others asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a phone interview she said that they believe that r@@ ink @-@ related controversy reflects a lack of di@@ vers@@ ität in the setting practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the great part of white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either she has no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese C@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they are safe or feel good to say what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of his workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday the Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a speaker , the company has recently been responsible for a personnel responsibility , focusing on ethnic groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , in turn , said she will be closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user as to us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership ISIS Secret Services , puts committee on Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changes detailed information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were allowed to place in a report on Thursday .
the Pre@@ liminary Report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the Libyan members of the Security Committee , and reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Services , reported to change their ass@@ essments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
central Command , in short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; message Government Information that were cancelled due to high @-@ level Cent@@ Com , recorded regularly , recorded a posi@@ tional picture of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering , if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership defect in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top @-@ top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips had given under Obama instructions to change the reports , as analysts look at the pressure from their fore@@ laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before the Congress were clearly positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com members publicly announced that a military recovery of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , this is much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ s@@ men from Kansas , in an opinion .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the points of Central Command changes the thou@@ ght@@ ful report to record the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force in life after they were played , analysts wor@@ ries about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings and will be continued during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the news agency published on Thursday their own findings , agreed with some of the conclusion of Republican Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited process for the development of nach@@ richt@@ en@@ al app@@ rais@@ als to I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest level Democ@@ rat in the county , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion .
this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of thou@@ ght@@ ful reports , &quot; sh@@ ook the mor@@ ality among analysts and , &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats said to have no clu@@ es on an intervention of the White House on Cent@@ Com analysts in regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who received following complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press calls for the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tors are still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial debate on these important issues of national defense . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions for the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion which has meanwhile made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , have taken the question posed by President Obama to leave the Central Command for honour@@ able ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a piece of writing about how the then government had seen only a small occupying troops in Iraq and had a little time on it to make thoughts about the after@@ math of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team increased by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to government officials , that contrary to the government &apos;s claims , there were no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these temporary refin@@ eries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition was not published however , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the leg@@ islat@@ ure due to its excessive positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win four @-@ fourth match in the field @-@ hockey field of women , a show@@ down with great Britain .
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates of the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their goals in mind .
it does not know , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are similar in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place to un@@ rest after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will hit record on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place in their group .
the first placed , however , will make a little bit longer from the way leading the other group .
as always the game will go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising action by their success story , four years after they landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ rie in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as it couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then the year 2012 , in which for her and her team went all wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the subsequent year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began making things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work sp@@ ens@@ um in London we have now .
we have covered the ru@@ d@@ der completely around .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the area .
India had gone the game without victory in the game , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the playing level of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took her hands in their hands .
she carried out a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and lu@@ te the ball to the Americans for a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez did the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a fool in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , too late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanent and inev@@ it@@ ably , a race @-@ run relay between competition and pursu@@ it .
it is like the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which becomes a s@@ wimm@@ ers from the wrist@@ bands for the Turner &apos;s tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t switch on the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ase@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female car@@ ef@@ ull with dimples , could definitely be sent to the Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV commer@@ ci@@ als when he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fought in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame is lit up every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow are sports that are not generally accepted : air guns , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ feed and may reign over it for a long time .
but if I should make a modest arguments for my particular love , then you let me give attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years so many believed that many of the ones I asked , didn &apos;t know that there is a Olympics .
that could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , never won a medal in trampoline jumping and made a athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it up to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans to share women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has a certain outer lateral char@@ ms , partly because it sounds for the un@@ resolved ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but I &apos;m just a little bit of enthusiasts .
it has humor@@ ously potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ ors of his never to end up - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gymn@@ asi@@ um and tau@@ rine , the two sports that it essentially combines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means a lot like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stri@@ pping vic@@ tors jumping on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must end a series of falling movements ( rotating , real and salad ) before being landing at the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are rated according to the official Olympi@@ ad to design , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flying time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest to go beyond gold , go faster , up and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes go and back , down@@ wards and down to the playground .
they do not only hunt the finishing line or the output wall , but in the TV broadcast another height goal : the world or the Olympics .
the goal of stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , mar@@ vel@@ ous , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir up a spect@@ ator .
but it is what I even more sensitive to see these games as a little ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers a breathing .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a reverse movement is not the target .
he or she sto@@ oped down , seem@@ ingly heavy as an astr@@ on@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during the practice there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the target , no wolves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant raising time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 .
N@@ BC will ex@@ ert the final figures as part of a afternoon block at two days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to over@@ see in general tum@@ ult .
if the increasing awareness of male athletes can only be achieved through the anxiety and objec@@ fication of male athletes - just like the male American Turner at the The Wall Street Journal recently proposed - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his move to air , a new fan base .
&quot; one generation prot@@ rac@@ ted &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the United States
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia , met for violent resistance in the government .
witnesses say that the prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia just going to break down ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid consortium of West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the past months , protests against the government struck the country and expanded in more areas .
last week thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s answer was un@@ merciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen shoot armed prot@@ esters and killed .
in circulation , videos across the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now asking an ongoing investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country and will soon become more difficult , &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is still the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the west .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ian to combat terrorist dangers beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in its remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new p@@ end@@ game in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia had everything else than a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continually led the oppression with the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , dis@@ sidents were effective to silence .
many were sent into exile or into prison , or were driven into the wilderness by the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people , and these are no other options to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous dis@@ comfort that cover everything from the ground @-@ use to the thro@@ ws in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
following an extensive election last year , the ruling party and its allies gain the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea ; a struggle for this tor@@ ch , controversial line demanded hundreds of life in June .
analysts are fear@@ ing that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were forced more or less on the last few years , could benefit the turbul@@ ence .
several factors explain why feelings of the pro@@ vocation after years of H@@ ink@@ öch@@ el@@ ns explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smart phones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate via the social media , because cheap smartphones were increasingly more frequent and improved Internet services .
even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are located .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave to that they gathered so much protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since O@@ ons prosp@@ ered the am@@ har@@ as that come from Eth@@ op@@ i@@ ens predominantly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they are exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in low@@ land areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are there to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the secret services , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ city illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was viewed as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly vulnerable to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special contrac@@ tor to cause enemies and to make it harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing on this fundamental idea , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , a conflict analyst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ clear reasons to increase the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
the Lord Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of the North Sea , comes from H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the south .
analysts say that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services .
many feared that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands against elections were prot@@ esting , according to the analyses apparently by the government , and then stolen from the government .
during the following Raz@@ cia , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in recent months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ end@@ ment , as well as for their measur@@ able advances in poverty .
but obviously this does not have the intention of intensi@@ fication of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month of captured prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic town , of Tig@@ ray driven business , and hatred toward the tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say that protests were the United States and other Western allies into a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights to the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he doesn &apos;t want to inter@@ rupt its ally in a vol@@ atile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin gr@@ ating migration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded ISIS is &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy against his campaign by giving his campaign , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication develops new questions about the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republi@@ cans , whether he is able to communicate clear and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fellow soldier , who ende@@ av@@ our to take him while an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain to the actual position , which he could not have meant .
after he had made the announcement of a campaign events on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made reference to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in a early morning Twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he &apos;s just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the Twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a row of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation entirely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the final storm of criticism against Mr. Tr@@ ump desc@@ ended , while he tries to focus the focus of his campaign due to falling sources to economic conditions .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump attempted to return again to this issue .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m into his defence already .
at the end of July he moved strong criticism against him when he said the Russians should wait Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he said , &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ cas@@ us . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then turn back to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans how they arrive , and then , if necessary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ use the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more corro@@ sive sound as its survey had gone further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a huge advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally tempted to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to distor@@ ted his statements or not to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he stands in focus on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps has brought his loyal Mit@@ stre@@ iter into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant his testimony .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps most prominent inter@@ viewers , received great effort to defend candidates today in CNN &apos;s interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in that sense , that before Obama ISIS is an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back ben@@ ches , completely false and so it happened because he pulled off the troops from Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am @-@ Republi@@ cans attempt to argue that the government minist@@ ered to Obama as Secretary of State , it allowed ISIS to spread out that the situation in the Middle East is aggressive under control .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and designed them to fight on any of his words and to be bi@@ ased .
he de@@ fied the poor , j@@ und@@ u@@ ary &quot; television expert , trying to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot;
some of the demo@@ cr@@ ats mo@@ cked on Mr. Tr@@ umps exc@@ used as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dency .
once more about the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ amed café in William@@ sburg , which one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but had a good coffee for 15 years .
of course the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front was pushed .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s shop , which used Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals noticed it as last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ ats@@ wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know New York is change , but I can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if New York change is , it &apos;s also new .
a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodriguez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , held a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment with them .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and acid onions .
there is natural en@@ code .
the café serves no beer more , there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodriguez , Rodriguez noted that he noticed a st@@ owed stream of old tri@@ bal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed by prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she was pulled to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee @-@ r@@ ink , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became clear that it was the coffee and the culture of the ver@@ b , which was pleased to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they set a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a pro@@ long@@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered un@@ avoid@@ able di@@ gest@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss fo@@ b watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything @-@ ba@@ gel with bacon , eggs and cheese .
Rodriguez said he has no den@@ ser , that the soap store took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee bars as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll still enter into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodriguez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have accepted the café also .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he has prepared to make her soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold @-@ loved coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground , when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt told that the entrance of the local and the Order felt a new coff@@ ees like a return of home .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a f@@ oo@@ dies , President Roosevelt made a Fai@@ thful Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Aqu@@ arian Tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was written by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks in their book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; tells the life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity than they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , snor@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ h in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since its IP@@ O in 1929 .
brick , 54 , put a fresh water container away with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables .
when the reporter min@@ ced Hack@@ roast , this took place the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap prepared by the ingredient .
imagine so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must have been in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male cli@@ ffs and it was served fresh baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans , who sent to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the paths to which the country went down to be no longer the s@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in which food was a central , distributed theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time the new bud@@ get@@ ary food was : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ollen were recovered of basic food that could recover the water remains as &quot; wonderful species , food resi@@ du@@ es , &quot; noticed Zi@@ egel@@ man , as ba@@ the in@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients could hide under a d@@ dy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by Che@@ ap dry fruit .
meat that had been the centre of the American kitchen for years , became a rare luxury .
such mix@@ tures were tried out , as a cal@@ orie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction was pressed in front of taste or even healthy cooking .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man made a dish made out of this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the court , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping .
as never before or since , since Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 , the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 .
by being published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ as and cre@@ mi@@ ge sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rot into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical treats .
in particular , the reports about the government &apos;s answer to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmers in the kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million@@ th man of the world , to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucum@@ bers , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was wonderful real@@ ation .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same error if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ure with his stomach a stamp .
as described in the book , the annex@@ e of a house@@ keeper performed with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt , that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most canc@@ eled food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food was rejected , once the country came back on his legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , and said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food@@ stuffs .
the couple were better understood at the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law better - for example , how food could not throw away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real afraid of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; she really made people ill . &quot;
there was the storm of wind .
after the plates were ev@@ acu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they drew and co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um eating , ate the president Roosevelt to lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , modest recipes to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no beaten cream , just pl@@ um , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone re@@ adily di@@ pped a spoon into the f@@ ences , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it was not bad .
CO@@ E fet@@ ched himself three times a night .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ tier@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; a few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs assault : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died for an end @-@ bomb attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that saved the lives of 60,000 people so far .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to draw people from the bom@@ bed houses and to make their first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the mar@@ ker that shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians in the lumin@@ ous symbol of the horror of the war .
however , as heroes never seen himself , he said , &quot; For me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , I am dying to save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to the victim , he talked about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four versions of the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlor@@ inated gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rarely scenery .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea on board the S@@ anna research center .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms at least 1 km / h across the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie get only with 150 years old offspring .
the Greenland shar@@ ks floating along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is at average 1.@@ 220 meters away .
only when it comes to it , the five metre long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal .
this lon@@ ge@@ ful lifestyle seems to be a patent remedy for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any of a Greenland , 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock comments these li@@ fes@@ pan , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolution@@ ary biolog@@ ist suspected that Greenland is become rock @-@ old .
just lack the evidence .
Greenland is difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface usually only in winter .
researchers know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
her time ben@@ ds emp@@ ties them when they held six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard for six animals .
prey make this shar@@ ks still : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed the ja@@ w of a young polar bears .
possibly , they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice age and are looking for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water layers after down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the north Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 502 @-@ cen@@ tim@@ eters measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed using the carbon @-@ 14 method@@ ology of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye lens is formed already before the birth of the shar@@ ks which are contained in the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in lime @-@ core .
therefore , their birth was supposed to be in the early 1960s , as nuclear tests try larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in contrast , 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters length of the third smallest animal contained a minor surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all bigger Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks in their lens had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ tim@@ eters long Greenland is an age of 335 years , while the Rekord @-@ Ha@@ i should be 3@@ 92 years old while the Rekord @-@ Ha@@ i should be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females get until then when they are more than four meters , it was known .
now the researchers were able to submit an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks have obviously settled at least one and a half centuries .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , placed in his bacon on the neck of a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught Alaska in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , often the body of the animals live on spar@@ kles .
they mature later - and s@@ lows slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , animals are often very large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal feed heat .
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it as possible as possible as many offspring as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary biolog@@ ist .
however , a very large animal should rather invest his resources into a long life .
building site in double pack
with topics around building , the municipal council has been focused on the most recent meeting .
with relief , the panel adopted the message from Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of re@@ juven@@ ating housing can begin . &quot;
after the plot , par@@ is@@ hable and closing requests were clari@@ fied and the applications could be put on survey@@ ing , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; street road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Buil@@ der section 1 ) is nothing more in the way .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the blo@@ wers settled in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au young families and rü@@ ge seniors alike .
as promised , building @-@ content can be promp@@ ted immediately in the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to be consul@@ ted in its September meeting .
to add requests to the res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial establishments , associated with the creation of job creation , the municipal council decided to re @-@ establish new business plan in parts of this year until spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ tim@@ lar@@ n , there is already proven commercial area around two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ xit
the city in the main competition was the best chance to create jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ Countries , Head of the Comp@@ et@@ ence of Comp@@ et@@ ence Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
after Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether there are money stores of London from financial transactions in the whole EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is sufficient for approval in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that just utili@@ ze large US banks .
several banks have already announced , jobs jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is calculated with 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , re@@ united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
although in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the music is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ans .
Luxembourg stays a large fund industry , but as well as Dublin is worse by the infrastructure .
Frankfurt will be much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
also points the city with easy available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ uns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate is by 50 percent higher than am Main .
in addition , Frankfurt had a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer stand the city on No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with his strong position as a financial position for the European internal market , Frankfurt could draw further banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W .
London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit at the most important financial center in Europe .
that &apos;s also the power relations : in London , according to the numbers of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , in the end of 2015 , about 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt , it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. mag@@ i@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to the refund of the legal cost you created from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated by a compensation payment in the amount of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents from Mer@@ ck , having covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts .
in survey of the complaint on Thursday , U.S. counterpart of Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead will be entitled to obtain the cost , which were created during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to compens@@ ate with Gilead to cure the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead and Mer@@ ck were mut@@ ually exclusive and became the property of laboratory work , where Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r attributed the active ingredient in the drug of Gilead .

the Democratic Liberation of Syria ( D@@ KS ) strains after the statement of the still remaining group of fighters who have excav@@ ated within the city , currently the city .
they have liberated more than 2,000 civilian deaths , which were held by fighters as ho@@ stages , the Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council ( Reuters ) shared with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just run up @-@ up work through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal government taxes
Hillary Clinton released their tax return for 2015 on Friday , this resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charity purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton spent almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ emer ; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s publishing house on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , publi@@ cis@@ ed together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; called Clin@@ t Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ per in Jennifer Pal@@ amm@@ i in an opinion .
in a w@@ ak@@ y contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false statements and re@@ ten@@ ders in terms of its previous promises to publish its tax declar@@ ations .
it is custom@@ ary to publish their tax declar@@ ations for U.S. presidential candidates , although they are not obliged by law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax review due to tax authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; says Clinton &apos;s election campaign Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the demo@@ cr@@ ats .
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Advisor to CNN , that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the control tests are not completed .
Tr@@ umps critics , among others also the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already cleared questions regarding assets , its donations for charity institutions , its business environments , and various other compounds , in particular with Russia .
Clinton had already over@@ threw a video on the topic and published on Friday a video on the Internet in which Republi@@ cans Tr@@ ump invited his tax return .
on Thursday , she talked about the theme during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and publish its tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poli@@ tico reported that Tr@@ ump had paid no or less taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax collectors and tax advis@@ ers , the indications that this could still be the case .
federal government has become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation which is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that persons pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its headquarters , Tr@@ ump to share their tax declar@@ ations .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a control of the IRS and I have subjected tr@@ ump &quot; fears &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has been decl@@ ining tax declar@@ ations until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which now lives in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , is paying an effective Federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax statement of the Clin@@ t from 2015 showed that this was only USD 100 of their income as a wage , unlike most of all Americans .
their main investment fund was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ t divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,000 .

nature prot@@ ector in Tanzania are using an orthodox style to keep eleph@@ ants from it , in people living settlements - they throw con@@ doms filled to them that are filled with chili powder .
the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Foundation , which had already been the idea for years ago , trained by the US nature protection , trained by volunteers in villages in the north Tanz@@ anian , a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without injury animals .
previously , many speakers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the dealer day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe an amendment to their attitude , where they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damage the elephant , &quot; said the director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message .
the first two steps take the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and b@@ lowjob in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he is not troubled , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;

one last possibility is an advertis@@ ers that shoot a gold fire@@ work into the air and caused a loud , bright explosion .

Jewish director kills Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has no Israeli pre@@ fix in Berlin since the Arab guests had requested an employee &quot; according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Trial , Sho@@ a , sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s selection list .
however , the country was not listed between countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel eliminated and deleted ?
wrote to Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel recep@@ tion@@ ality .
the answer he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , loos@@ ened more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the selection will be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
that is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this is worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation requires this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a pretty big response in the Internet , where people called it a scandal .
some were under@@ lined by the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given to the alleged indications of Arabic guests . &quot;

police uses Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Rub@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against prot@@ esters in Brazilian students
students were strug@@ gling on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police , when they gathered together to demonstrate against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police consisted of lac@@ ri@@ sts and rub@@ bing against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers attempted to disper@@ sing the students , leading to the police of Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their support over the plans .
according to the proposals by the Governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money .
some of the protest@@ ants saw Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tits to spray against the provisional pre@@ sidents Michel T@@ emer on the walls .
the recent protests occurred some days after demonstr@@ ators left in masses on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma R@@ ousse@@ ff , which was revealed by a vote of the Senate to their calling from the ministry .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rise to 71 % - RT Business
according to Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading margin between Moscow and Teheran , grew by 7@@ 0.9 % compared to the previous year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest of Russian companies grew strongly against businesses in the country , distributed by the ambassador .
Russian companies accept existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
of course , another trading is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noticed that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 % compared to the same period in 2015 and an increase of $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trading post was reached by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign officers amounted to approximately 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily from Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran also reached the top 20 countries , as regards the tourist destinations in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken down from last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador is hoping that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received monuments of old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cyclists
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the Män@@ ner@@ team Sprint at Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role of his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y , made the legend proud when he was home to home a victory of New Zealand &apos;s favorite New Zealand .
England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y repeated the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they re@@ peti@@ tioned the trick , after returning in March at the London World Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ res a gap , the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which she stayed when they saw potential in the gravel , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner set a Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ar@@ round winning the New Ze@@ al@@ ander in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap was barely back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy change made a large part of transformation , when import@@ ing in a higher way to slow it , and Kenn@@ y , and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert from his position and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y , and Hin@@ des , when they rose to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we put an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des gave evidence that he fell to the railway after a weak start .
he later returned this statement later , and there was no appeal of England &apos;s rival .
this time there was no problem with such a over@@ lap victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; execution : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like all GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were awarded seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if the bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months is that we are expecting successful five days at the Vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born March 23 ( an apparently holy date for the British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the p@@ ood@@ le of the Ho@@ y right away .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team @-@ Event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there were further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they came to the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , at which Wig@@ gins continue with safety .
yesterday , he was cont@@ ested with the qualification before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the appropriate Women &apos;s competition that will continue and finished tomorrow , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team rely on his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a donation to medals .
after an extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven .
they played Dra@@ mas in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April is am@@ id@@ st in the heart of sex and bul@@ b@@ ing@@ es as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks like the first night of the competition in Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks like the legendary reputation GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , again to be repeated .
future of anne@@ aling from Portland due to repe@@ aling the energy policy fra@@ grant
the future of aluminium s@@ mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers from workers - are on the game , as the plant operators are termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , thus raising the supply contracts such as the delivered energy company .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the plant &apos;s operation .
a sub@@ sidy of 20 years is scheduled for November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland are on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs , direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
moreover , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ Eff@@ ective as the melt is consumed by around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa decided to melt the Point Henry melt , which resulted in a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the lon@@ gl@@ asting spec@@ ulations about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the big aluminium mel@@ on with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ te Valley , told that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is situated in a majority owned by Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , which holds the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt &quot; means &quot; the company divided .
AG@@ L said further that the treaties so @-@ called &quot; secure businesses &quot; were to be entered into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L told that it has already written the value of the contracts in its annual amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expectation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the treaties , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ mot@@ o ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; melt the melt or not inter@@ fere with the power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that it was completed in 2010 a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have been to come into effect from November this year , even if there is still a statement to come back from the contract .
analysts are due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closing of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
at the beginning of the week analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland annually use some 600 meg@@ awatts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ awatts .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , Antonio at the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vo@@ gue
Antonio Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth Dau@@ gh@@ ter of Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der , and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on its Inst@@ agra@@ m account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover gave me weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote San Antonio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ on@@ ) ( with the exception of the most popular Show@@ biz on@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as she finishes the cover of her sister and finished with a classic whi@@ st@@ end : they all have a surprise party planned .
this represents the cl@@ eric @-@ hair@@ y plot close to each birthday ( Se@@ ac@@ re@@ mn@@ ant brought the sentence , &quot; You suspected that we could have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to take part in this publi@@ city .
with regard to the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vo@@ gue , there has been a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an .
Kend@@ alls great sister Kim likes her to see what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most comprehensive issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference , which is rather resem@@ bles a picture tape as a fashion magazine , the edition of a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accord@@ ing to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a was from the 8@@ 32 pages of the owner 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revel@@ ations of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is eag@@ erly eag@@ erly anticip@@ ating that in the last two years images of the magazine has yet been sick@@ ered before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Moss .
in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the Mod@@ ules &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the low chance that Ms. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - is found in a good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people related or reality stars or young people of today who know how to edit a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if all things applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women to record in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover appeared with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
naturally j@@ enn@@ ant doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with its reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always a bit ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June , the single Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and she called them &quot; the pieces of eye bli@@ sters . &quot;
these feelings came up again , when the message came out with the release J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but to ride on the mis@@ fortune seems to pass by the point .
Antonio Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your tour of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
and all of her sisters sell your pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her paintings from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine .
and in her free time she is watching TV in reality . probably just to see their sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centres annually show 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxili@@ ary centers are being rejected by the municipal centres annually , while the industry has already made the impact of further mid cuts to over@@ load transactions .
in Queensland three of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair Del@@ og@@ ations and the similar ones - they are searching for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the community , which are already out@@ sour@@ ced , are ready for further cuts .
as of June , next year , the legal centres will lose a further 30 percent of their Federal resources .
the director of Que@@ enst@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Government centers had already revealed thousands of people each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without repe@@ al the decision of the Federal Government would only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ lands Common @-@ centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning thousands of people from important service you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave non@@ violent relationships , people with in@@ ad@@ orable and impressive debts , families who were dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have unfair problems - all these people have problems of legal form and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
by June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut its funding by 30 percent , meaning thousands of helpful people from Queensland to be forced to prevent their legal problems without any assistance .
we call for the Federal Prosecutor and federal ministers as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these mid cuts immediately , so that the people may need to obtain legal problems .
last year , the state government met their commitment to raise funds for legal duties on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the community centres and their customers to view the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey ahead of the country @-@ elections : SPD and CDU
considerable losses on government proposals in the state of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) draw considerable losses for the gover@@ ning party of the SPD and CDU .
this resulted in representative surveys from the opinion research Institute in ins@@ a for the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black governmental coalition could continue to reg@@ ain in the north , this is not possible after the demand values in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have good chances to continue to head government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collapsed from 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
the party makes it only slightly ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed among the left and the Af@@ D .
the left wing came to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
despite a slight decrease of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens will return to the s@@ atin @-@ day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not present in the country &apos;s day with 3 percent .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD survey said that only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 percent ) .
the CDU was only 18 percent to 2@@ 3,4 percent .
this equ@@ ates to the Gre@@ ens with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
Af@@ ro was represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return , the pirates would not miss the one in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came on the market .
today , the followers domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cking .
the built @-@ in store was eight Meg@@ abytes , which would now range for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
the iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , to shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the age @-@ time of the internet era .
but 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer exhibition C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; Office in the West &quot; format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and emails were sent and received , including fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser , al@@ beit slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be worked like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen discovered .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 euros .
the average price of smart phones in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could ad@@ mon@@ ish in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates the market , all of which came later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
the company &apos;s global turnover is about 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ ongoing business in the countless app provider and telecommunic@@ ations concerts come .
the whole industry has grown around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market just arrived at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World to introduce the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communications , easy to use with touch screen .
the winner of the Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the corporation .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the follow @-@ up .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after the invention of its invention .
on average , each German has now seen 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn the smartphone even away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s ball , responsible for staff in Siemens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand to Heathrow .
Heathrow will not only bring to our local municipalities and in London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me the biggest attraction was represented at the same time as in 2012 in London when we held a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions prof@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will reach again by creating new possibilities for local and firms near Heathrow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities we have already set 10,000 new apprentices alone , creating 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such things that will be thinking that the challenge of the enlargement of Heathrow would be too large .
it was told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blo@@ om on the world stage .
the two had in@@ justice in 2012 and they will also lie in Heathrow .
there are always obstacles to exagger@@ ate , but Heathrow answered every question .
like the Olympic Games Heathrow touched for many and not for single infrastructure project .
extension is a possibility to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in weather conditions and a legacy of skills and employment as well as to the airport in the whole of UK .
we have a great team in Heathrow , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , which has been selected for the world &apos;s best airport terminal by the end of T2 , which was built in the heart of the two frequencies range .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Olympic Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one of them .
it is time that we direct from those Olympic spirit and Heathrow , as well as our future trading and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz und mouse game &quot; regarding display block
for companies that earn money with On@@ line@@ age money , according to one of the software manufacturing tests , advertis@@ ers blocked , a &quot; cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game &quot; are equal .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook , Ad@@ block Plus would block on his desktop , released Ad@@ block Plus , released that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the en@@ coding regarding his advertising show to make it difficult to recognize the display which is part of the site advertising .
but Ad@@ block told that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams said that &quot; this kind of H@@ in and Her @-@ Her @-@ Stru@@ ggle Between the Aff@@ ecting Open Source Community and the Um@@ pf@@ tors have been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has let social media in combat is a powerful indication of how wor@@ r@@ ying indicator loos@@ er for the industry became .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe approximately 200 million people are used worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion users active users who access Facebook over their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ der makes 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company has no effect on display block@@ ers on Desktop PCs , since mobile ad block block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenues , so Facebook appears the investment of such a worthwhile as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared it to update its &quot; ad pre@@ ferences tool &quot; to have more control over them on them .
on Thursday , Facebook asser@@ ted that Ad@@ blocks would take care of new filters , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertis@@ ed .
&quot; for the users , there is no positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a message from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication .
ad block block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , why we are concent@@ rating on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences instead to put more control into the hands of the people .
Ms. in comm@@ itting suicide on Swiss highway
the victims was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police invo@@ ke witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was believed on a highway driving on a highway .
the incident occurred near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d , shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in Dun@@ kl@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Wa@@ adt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 years that was driving from several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not been identified yet , the police informed them and every witnesses of the incident to report themselves .
a investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , the Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter told the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait , if one of the driver will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
that is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
there are two similar cases in the last five years that the driver did not move to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - where one person ran in the Dun@@ kl@@ en on the highway , it was decided that drivers won &apos;t assume that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper &apos;s name .
last year , a polic@@ y@@ ho@@ ist of the driving force was acquitted when she had over@@ ride a man and killed in August 2014 one night on the A1 close to Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious in the street .
the court pointed out that the polic@@ eman had answered the police -- on a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the Judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should noti@@ fied by the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate @-@ model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable by the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms that res@@ emble from clim@@ bers .
the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ density atmosphere was once referred to in similar conditions .
scientists have shown earlier that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , inher@@ ent atmosphere , and still slowly turned around .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably proved more dry places than de earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from qu@@ or@@ ated .
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exp@@ on@@ ates its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io stated in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like a umbrella , around the surface of a large solar heat .
the results are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a story of Venus , which resem@@ bles Evolution , which was thought earlier by Planet@@ arium research .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed .
the oceans ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was fired from ultra@@ violet light .
when you removed hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere was left to carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know them today .
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy joins the coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy went back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and lead to a low @-@ determination Law in the team &apos;s decision .
alternatively @-@ President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will be looking for a new trainer immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I made my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ acy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long and much thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to give it more deep and bring it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to achieve this , the vision of the train@@ ers and vice President Of Hockey operations must be perfectly ge@@ ared towards the organisation .
he must also have a co @-@ determination in decisions which influence the power of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had been hired by Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him just the best for the future .
during his debut season with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , he was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and on first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as a Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ oil workers take conversations again , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles concerning the re@@ mun@@ eration for Northern overseas workers will be suspended while all parties apply for a new discussion round at the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against oil @-@ field providers Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and r@@ ushing unions can confirm that we have been united to re@@ launch the processing process of current quest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some full day sessions in the coming weeks , starting the beginning of next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating will follow a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the necessary room to come through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , as it conclu@@ des its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ sion@@ ing connection with the UK energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation that rely on the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met in the beginning of this week with workers leaders to discuss one of the largest labour disp@@ utes ever met in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a economy that works for many , not just a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend an average of around $ 7 billion in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures red @-@ rate of stars in the star @-@ enh@@ ancing of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Kepler &apos;s space teles@@ cope has helped to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star region of the Ple@@ j@@ aden .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in star @-@ enh@@ ancing at different rates , as well as in which context are the rotary @-@ time rooms with the planet@@ arium .
&quot; we hope to learn more about the compar@@ ing of our results with other star@@ ters , more about the relationship between mass mortality , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s inf@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from Earth .
many stars in this constellation originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are turning the fastest .
to peak rot@@ ational rates , these stra@@ pping stars cast great amounts of stars .
as this win@@ ch travel through the mag@@ net@@ fields of the stars , they have an brake effect on the stars .
when a star diff@@ ers , its rot@@ ation@@ rate starts to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of every death by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- as s@@ ungl@@ asses .
the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ y@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while against faster red fans tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said rebel .
as the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ mop@@ olitan laboratory to compare qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s still a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates , and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
the g@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball Star joins
the tears run among Alex Rodriguez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional response announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will carry on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es bear .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to join the &apos; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star game participant of major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times was elected to the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten year contract has been compl@@ ained about 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contrac@@ ting on December 31 , 2017 , he will also serve as consultants and youth coach - at full salary .
as players depos@@ ited it long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Nav@@ ers ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2000 ) , and since 2005 he has made some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old has not yet been taken into the rest hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successfully Rodriguez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was so disputed is its occurr@@ ence outside of the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , prohibited ster@@ oids have taken place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 he was imprisoned for 211 games in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal until the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered to be a major suspect that endu@@ red for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock has been reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done for the year 2014 , because I played no break for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodriguez back then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days lost no noise .
while many bas@@ eball legends have played the big stage in their final games , Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include any farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; corro@@ ded Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodriguez , who was married with actress Cameron Di@@ az , was married to me with Pop@@ star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , sympathy and fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ du@@ als Boston Red SO@@ X .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sang the p@@ endants at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ insky are first d@@ oping results
caught : because of a positive d@@ oping sample , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ insky will not start in Rio in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overs@@ had@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping .
an experienced ath@@ let would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh day of competition , the first official d@@ oping tests will be known to the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ insky were tested positively in Brazil - immediately before the start of the anti @-@ critical Athletics competitions this news to the in@@ time .
for Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been detected last Sunday , which is used as a mask for d@@ oping tests .
the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon in their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final about 100 m Butterfly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds later it missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the pen@@ alties of over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B rehear@@ sal and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the National Association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation in investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S . &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sport@@ s@@ ation of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa caused by the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the Track tin .
according to the report , it is said to deal with the banned substance to deal with the blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended continuously , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ test should also be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow immediately applied immediately with criticism against the ath@@ let of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why sport@@ s@@ men didn &apos;t draw the right shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , about all Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ polluted nation can not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ insky , &quot; the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg , was tested positive on the an@@ ab@@ olic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both den@@ ounces the intake , however , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had the complete Russian team up to an exception for systematic Dop@@ l@@ ayed to the start , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
the earlier failure in China had also ensured a serious disp@@ utes between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t access the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium of 200 m Freestyle I will give Me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sun was also at the heart of a confron@@ tation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping cou@@ pl@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested by the Chinese championships in 2014 on stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ ack@@ ers her rans@@ om
programm@@ ers @-@ malware programm@@ ers currently use target @-@ specific companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey conducted by the Malware Vice @-@ Speci@@ alists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past 12 months have at least once , partially with multiple victims of a com@@ press@@ er software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already achieved a rank@@ case with a ran@@ som@@ ware replacement .
40 % of the victims paid to the required funds required by the judges to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their im@@ press@@ ors software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to er@@ ect extingu@@ ishing money falls significantly higher than in private individuals .
&quot; we currently ob@@ serving a frigh@@ tening rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were designed to adver@@ tise advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators first discovered auth@@ oring software for itself .
only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ acking was carried out during the last months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer , it is looking for long @-@ changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the er@@ press@@ er .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims must be money - usually in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ rus Bit@@ coin - excessive .
but where the personal photo database is on the game , it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stands shut .
accordingly , the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ware strike .
22 percent of German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break business activities completely ; in one case people were in danger of life danger .
in Germany , several hospitals were already victims of attacks , whose patients could be threatened by the loss of hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims always : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you can only improve the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data again .
for managers it is difficult , considering the stand@@ still in operation the calls of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure security researchers examined the user surface and contact with the er@@ press@@ ors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money .
they explain their sacrifices by chat , as they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set free pre @-@ access support sites for free example files .
and will individuals pay for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to pay hard and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to withdraw their data .
in view of the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ Dis@@ claim@@ er the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains safety @-@ experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; one individual can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
more likely , however , is that it is three or four people .
the programmer sell their pollut@@ ants software in the form of a software building to the actual er@@ press@@ er .
the existing malware kits were created by the malware himself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; delivery includes a adap@@ table , so that smaller configuration , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the er@@ press@@ er then search for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log@@ ged in one of the forums on the underground , buys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on possible many PCs .
payment is made per modified calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , crimin@@ als toler@@ ate sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known to many companies that secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies responsible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust in Ran@@ som@@ ware using file back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
thus , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; when the encryption of data is not sufficient a threat to successful exploration , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or quot@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this is the potential of damage , depending on the type of data , a more times higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators could also use their new goals in the internet of things on the internet .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the vers@@ atility of a mini@@ vans .
sounds quite over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V that has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz has been in everyday life as extremely flexible .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it seems close to one spot .
the materials of the interior space are well @-@ processed and work pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top is falling there .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with high @-@ precision and 10@@ 26 l of lined back @-@ up , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surface of the back@@ bench can be lifted up like Kin@@ os@@ essel to fold and offer a storage room that is up to the ceiling 1,@@ 24 m high .
the luggage compartment can be loaded , however , the charge level with 650 mm is slightly higher than the compar@@ ably Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide @-@ speed areas .
however , he should have somewhat qui@@ eter his work more qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine version : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
steering should be a little more direct .
the equipment can be found in the top version &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
for security systems , the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ wi@@ zard ( works up to pace 32 ) , the coll@@ ision prevention system and the track systems assistant .
the coll@@ ision swar@@ ts sometimes , because he assessed many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ em@@ ic objects . &quot;
very reliable works for the remote light assistant .
and the intelligent speed regulator is respon@@ ds to the road detection and imp@@ aired on demand .
but the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two US@@ B@@ - and HDMI jack are below the arm@@ rest and are therefore something very in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel engines are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , fuel from 20,000 Euros will receive from € 23@@ ,000 .
engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and all@@ y@@ able car .
Air@@ line ha@@ ves not : fall on flight bridge
air@@ line is not responsible for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is possible only by dangers , which are typical for air traffic , argued the Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a kne@@ e in the fall .
however , the accident could happen everywhere - it is a common life risk , so the court .
the airline had no damage to the man .
disease case : when paid the organizer
ill holidays only get money back after their trip , when the cause of the disease is desper@@ ate to be found in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten per cent of guests are shown to show the same symptoms .
in the ensu@@ ing case , a family was severely affected by the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ oise l@@ ur@@ k , diar@@ rhoea , and vomiting .
she spent nearly the entire holiday in the room .
their condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back on a defective cl@@ ut@@ ations , which allegedly contam@@ in@@ ates sea@@ water .
the family was the view , the journey would have been a def@@ icient , and appe@@ aled against the promot@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the shut@@ down was defective in fact .
but the organis@@ er received just shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out then that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information , so the judgment .
especially in the samples of water no imp@@ urities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by calling one another - belonged to the common life risk .
out of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 members .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the crimes committed by refugees in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state had to be occupied and decided to react to terrorist attacks at the same time .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and split .
we will not allow this triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if off@@ ender had to leave the country faster , but increase the safety and strength of the population for the refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Parliamentary election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another person@@ ic rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ izer for terrorism needs to be pun@@ is@@ hable again .
video surveillance should be improved , the weapons seems to be amended above all of the purchase of weapons in the Internet .
the last much discussed silence for doctors should be aware of de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , he wants to seek dialogue with the medical profession following solutions , such as the endanger@@ ment of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic effects .
in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care requirement .
teachers would have to be better prepared on dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
to the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special fields of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior declared clearly against shareholder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear@@ head for the char@@ gers in the CDU / CS@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gabriel said the papers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

better traffic flow on the highway edge
regularly , it st@@ alls on the road - here a picture from November .
but that should change : the legal bi@@ eg@@ g@@ ation should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are on the road traffic on the ambient road every night when they drive on the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the road operation extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th to 17th August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the departure Wes@@ eler Street , the right lane to the right lane at 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Straße .
the great advantage : the traffic is divided up early , which will improve the total expi@@ res on the complex section of the Federal Road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the driving rail on the train gli@@ der annoying the drivers mostly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days is enough to travel back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ g and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous clock on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Street .
from here the traffic on the motorway bridge is guided .
the second track had to be re@@ built over a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge does not have the required load capacity to absorb the heavy traffic two is@@ pur@@ ges .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ pass and that related daily stop@@ over , the responsible state cannot say .
however , to count with years : for the bridge has an official resi@@ dual period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal bi@@ eg@@ g@@ inal operation , the state company deliberately sought for the traffic light because with disabilities .
the traffic will lead to the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
inter@@ cultural trip : cultural activities for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Nim@@ a &apos;s Association and the Junge Theater now plan a music project .

most of the young@@ sters of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it would have been possible to follow the process , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster .

rain instead of star shooting : hope on weather repair
the weather has made the stars of shooting stars in the Sou@@ thwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stop by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suitable for clouds and rain badly to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chair of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday mor@@ nings .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star@@ ring is per@@ sil@@ ky , which includes 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star shooting stars .
they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ seus , that goes to the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , you are bound for ever , but at night you wake up to sleep , in the morning it is already far from the wake @-@ up cl@@ ing@@ les to think about sleep .
that &apos;s all others as relaxing .
after all , one has such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than 10 percent emp@@ loying their sleep often or not re@@ covering .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there can be certain causes of sleep , empha@@ sized Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aver , board member of the German Society of Sch@@ la@@ sty and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
but what you understand , however , the In@@ som@@ nie , therefore , is an input and sleeping disorder .
just to sleep through many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wagner is a member of the board member of the German house medical association with practice in the Dutch var@@ nish .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
it may cause organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors behind it , but also medicines .
not seldom , the sleep disorder is expressed by another condition .
&quot; very early awakening is common especially for depression , &quot; says We@@ ap@@ es .
and it can be that different factors need each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be po@@ or@@ ly lying , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and starts bl@@ asting about everyday problems and -@@ worry about everyday problems and worry , there is a cause .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces to the doctor ?
who should not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights a week , and the day should be imp@@ aired , advis@@ es advis@@ es .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : it is beaten , tired , dis@@ rup@@ ting , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
to re@@ lie@@ ve the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cog@@ nitive behavi@@ oral therapy , or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in case of acceptance and most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
staying in Germany hardly , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ xes , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep medical centre at the Char@@ ité University Institute , Berlin , Germany .
for this reason , at first time , you should first turn to the household denti@@ st at first time , advis@@ es advis@@ es .
it can clari@@ fy with investigations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should sleep in the sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for an investigation in the sleep laboratory , medical physician , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing , at bed@@ time , at bed@@ time or when you do not find the cause of a sleep@@ y disorder .
we don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ es .
after the c@@ abri@@ d one goes to the bed at its normal time .
beside the electro@@ des in the body one is wearing a no@@ g@@ og@@ gles , chest strap , and a fe@@ el@@ ers at the finger .
there is also a camera on the ceiling the sleeping .
how can those problems get in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of pitches where you can attach for a better sleep .
We@@ ak counts on : regular sleeping and rise times , not to sleep long in bed , do not sleep on the bed , alcohol and don &apos;t throw at the clock - then you begin to count immediately , and that is quite and certainly not eligible .
what the jungle camp with lack of medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold each Facebook to the dis@@ appointing cutting of the DS@@ V teams in Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time in Doha , and set up his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has put on Facebook via Facebook before his critic@@ ised ex @-@ team mates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where a Olympic champion gets 20,000 € a reward and a jungle of 150.000 € , nobody had to wonder about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 year old at night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping control , however , very good .
we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote much , and can &apos;t even be able to watch the d@@ oping on the topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set up here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would already have to be reported in nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be checked for a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent inspec@@ tors of the W@@ A@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not be eligible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election of Hamburg who now operates an ice@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of Lu@@ gg@@ age arrested
professional thi@@ eves at the airport Düsseldorf
the arrest of two women and two men died at the age of 50 to 61 years on Thursday .
the crime suspect had committed as a gang of several hand@@ ker@@ en- and luggage pil@@ es .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognized a gang from the airport of Düsseldorf &apos;s airport to know the police officers from the past theft .
since mid @-@ July this year , the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acy in mid @-@ July and were very professional , working and particularly profession@@ ally .
the specialists of the Criminal Code 34 can re@@ iter@@ ate the den@@ ial of crimes committed by off@@ ences to Germany , to prove four deeds .
in this case , they had caught more than 15,000 Euros .
Alt@@ bauten , a few lime trees , in between yet another head of the cob@@ ble@@ stone : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in looks not so , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the east to west , one comes along slots , a fresh@@ er kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
to the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite a Li@@ dl , which is to be demolished soon , it is already built : by 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; as well as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in is illustrated by burning cars in the last weeks .
for the reason , the house is occupied with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants rented contracts , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ Go zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the base of autonomous violence has been characterized as a tough approach towards the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ets for@@ mi@@ ths , had been cleared by 300 police officers , with 30 to 40 senior officials and three team cars on site , locked down parts of the street and attended visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown household owners are the premises .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers went under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road affects peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the pav@@ ement at the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others talk in late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects an elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located .
left violence is not the main attractions of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer lives that lives in the &quot; Kie@@ z , &quot; and J@@ ana * , who plays here three children , are gener@@ ously generated from the police presence .
with the residents of the building projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ying and genetic quanti@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound after a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z , who wish to wish the majority of police protection from v@@ and@@ ating left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dit@@ ch , whom the Berlin inside the city , and the police keep up between house her@@ etic and their neighbours , does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which is also today in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk .
even home@@ work and the native residential projects belong to the &quot; Kie@@ z : &quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former Democratic Republic , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been ev@@ acu@@ ated under large police officers in a regular road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly becoming a mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ tre@@ liner from all over the world : with them , local residents from the GDR times and former home offices share their &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot;
this is also noticeable by the r@@ ents , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they detect them in designed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to dy@@ es .
no other street was mentioned so often along with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason that not all neighbours will have the problem as a problem , might be that they are not affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively against police officers .
the largest part of the crimes make atomic damage , the ten@@ se rather the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer who lives in a rental house beside the controversial 94 years , uncertainty can be no speech .
as for violence , it is compl@@ ying : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they do not have been .
the famous burning cars also admit it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
for studying architect , its street is not a criminal force , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
this is why it was so important that local residents will return to their streets : from the police , politics and the media , in July all of them suddenly stressed the interpretation of the city .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road will continue to take away : through un@@ demanding new buildings in former buildings which conver@@ ts the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are more con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many of here - here are more people who are not so well booked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and Dest@@ ru@@ ction cannot be gu@@ essed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if a never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even in the police and the inhabitants .
for Zu@@ bay@@ on@@ ados , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the building projects and the left @-@ scene belonged to the &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot;
anyone who draws , should be aware of his own - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub district , can be compl@@ ain that bad about noise .
all with pre @-@ name presented people have asked to be mentioned not with their real name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee guide
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the response partner in integration and organizer .
in addition , she is social worker .
since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the management of the management of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a partner for all actors : refugees , working for refugees , administration , authorities and who else can mis@@ use .
Reg@@ ine customer of working group indicates that the volunteer is more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , which has a problem of wool mild wool , which has a problem .
so some - less mo@@ cked than rather imp@@ acted to the multitude of being targeted - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative department with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , a bl@@ asting wool mil@@ ky .
but administrative labor was not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent job scheduled for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client says that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and officials are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße soon
there has been a serious problem for some time , apartments for connecting flights to find that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for connecting rooms .
you must under@@ take refugees in own or rented apartment .
the costs for building , rent or renovation of these accommodation must bear the municipalities itself .
the responsibility changes from the agricultural office to Commun@@ e and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not each owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been a very difficult time for some time .
de facto , there is no private apartments .
if so far , it is not required to rely on private apartments so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore general apartments must be used , as it is so nice .
so , new containers are installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but with dwell@@ ings , it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a solid lead , intern@@ ship places , training places , school places , one @-@ Euro jobs and staff activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do @-@ profit work - and that motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but it does not work out work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a considerable feeling .
so , there are offers such as sport , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so we also jump in administration and hon@@ esty .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain the refugees that it takes time and they can make the time meaning@@ fully over@@ bridges , for example with language courses .
those who ever develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , I will never integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
there are also problems also , &quot; says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have been afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client says very clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ oeu@@ vre may call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resi@@ du@@ ck could and if they don &apos;t want to exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the terrorist attacks bring them complete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they do not have anything to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would happ@@ ily stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , major and honorary posts must be held in the region and in the region according to activities .
in the background , they always have in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
this question is clear to answer , the politics are afraid .
actually it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we are not there yet , where we would like , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that Ur@@ b@@ acher was able to pro@@ cure the previous human beings so well .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need , they have to help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
