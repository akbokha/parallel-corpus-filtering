<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">To invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - they want both Clinton and trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential seekers, however, are at tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns that the state of the economy can harm - with tax and regulatory.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to protect the economy and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, asserts trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will ride regulitions massively, and he is strong for an extensive tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain tasks to open, he has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">For that reason, taxes for the rich would be increased, says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the needs to be invested, trump and Clinton said almost wording.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant is even the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and become strictly rejected by the state-critical team of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be a further internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and run coal extraction in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas, to terminate the Parisian climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand and calls for renewable energies with its investment programme: "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - including international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the furtive trade agreement, don't want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US don't want to insist from international trade, but just to protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, Clinton calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars would be famed.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says," "" "The minimum wage has to stop, then he says he should not be changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the next months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side, there is a trump that wants to lieve the economy and citizens to spur growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics stop him, so the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton says that at least of the wealthy wants to pay more taxes and their critics saying: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who alone flee, almost to everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">One house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each baby has a baby, which is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in the arm.</seg>

<seg id="13">To say with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is part of Condrobs's Managing Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid offers in Bavaria, and deals with the theme of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen have fled.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north of one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-fleeing women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="24">In women, other reasons for the escape: "many steal out of it because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honours, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This continued to drive them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, tugboat call for a bottle of water a sexual act, is no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who think that the end, once they are coming in Germany, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and worst if misused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the Munich Region is traumatized, traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so familiar to say nothing.</seg>

<seg id="36">Since she often does not hesitate to assist, there are more accommodations for them, calls for danger.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven District governments for the accommodation of refugees are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they are aware of a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is nothing in the governments of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben are also not divided separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press contacts of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken, there are in some common areas of floors or their own houses, only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "" "rights of women and equality" "" "in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of Assistenzologists have called for their union to approve new labour measures regarding their disputes regarding a new treaty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outer sides"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and proclaim an official end of eight months in the words and economic sanctions." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish defender in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot forfeit the intrusion that Ankara wants most reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a hand, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked very narrow and it radiated hardly heat, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, spoke of his "loving boyfriend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to crisis, but could even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have heard that it would never happen anything.</seg>
<seg id="11">For me, his enthusiasm seemed to signify the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's dazzling, sustainable boldness showed that Russia's head of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution: the removal of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wutentable.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin parted out and accused Ankara to fall Russia into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The reason was even bigger, as it was committed by a mine boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetroe will be rebuilding up again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the government controlled media introduced a sharp, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once upon a time, the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the serious test, the accusations of senior officials, Erdogan's own family have benefited from illegal oil trading to Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse for the excuse that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is first of all friends who can get, after having revealed the last month with a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counted towards a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are once again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it in this way: "tourists long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is mad at the West, since its reaction to which tried power to be weak as weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the persistently resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike insists that the cool mood should benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian state of state won a bonus that he demanded the attempted coup d "état in Ankara following the attempted coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-known for Moscow, a self-eminence that has to change a deeper fear of regimes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one as it once described to me an analyst, "Alliance of Foreign Ministers": two countries that violate the west and then feel badly treated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public propitiation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual parties.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be revealing, that after almost three hours of the first talks, both presidents of the press conference said that they had not striped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey avoided it deliberately to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dispersion, as the NATO member, Turkey defrauded the Russian fighter jet - it certainly is better that the two leaders speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="5">In a position of the Kremlin it is that Putin ordered the release of Ivanovs of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been deputy in 2012 in Ivanovs and was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, he made his conclusion at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it means (in Russian) that he later became a leader and head of government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin on his appointment: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important role of the government to support your activity as head of state and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made a mystery.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time in one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet intelligence, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that Chief of Staff resorted to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile's smile for the cameras, just a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is the result of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man, who was praised once as a potential president, was once said to lead the Russian environment policy - pushed for big scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin which will be quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It's true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complained to confidential post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the position in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov was forced to become President of Russia after Putin's second term, because a third official mandate of Putin had to violate the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken from another, near allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister, before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a finicky activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks at their place and the last part of the Decks get a concrete pit for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted at the bridge to his seat.</seg>

<seg id="3">How does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 homes in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD suggests a "action concept" for the next raterning.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should build the favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the SPD leader Christoph Frmann writes:" "" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas will have to offer 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap flats, however, can also arise in the stock market.</seg>

<seg id="17">The action concept is implemented, will ensure additional tasks in building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program does not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments are supposed to be built-in.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how is it comparing the loss of another about 1300 convenient flats, which will run out in the next few years?</seg>

<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get there in the price for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they don't want the owners, housing companies not.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child may not go out without any longer, but rather preferring their leisure time to spend on screens, was beted in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about to get people from the sofa and be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The screen at first time was on the TV, then restricted to video games and recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it's great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I also refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later developed a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture fell the interest in the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their smartphones are looking out and search for Pokémons that were followed by a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (over a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the waahn and jumped for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that returns the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiff, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, announced that within two days after the market launch of the game, the number of participants followed every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it's only the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public reconnaissance campaigns for health, people want to get" "" "to get" "" "of the sofa" "" "and" "" "compete in deaf ears because many public embassies are getting boring and come from people who look like miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who work regularly sports, reduces its chances to get involved in cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, which is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing to Pokémon Go is that there is people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">So there are three pillars of health covered, movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people work on the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">Anyway, there are also mosaic games that must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run around a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could already follow our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be replenished with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman, who won a multi-competition title, and overall the fifth, while they consolidate their reputation, the best of their generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was in this moment an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success shows her in the same league such as Michael Phelps, who brought her sports on new heights:</seg>

<seg id="17">It was expected to be a final exam in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athlete, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports that were published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of the deadliest attacks in the first series of series of series by Phoenix, while listening to the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a ride, said the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrators fired eight shots from a hand-fire weapon, while he stood on the passenger side of the car, and then fled with another vehicle, to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police informed that the triple murder would not have been the result of a predatory blow, as the attackers did not take the handbags or the $2,900, that were owned by adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The officer of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting in investigators led the investigator to become a close look if it is linked to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">All in all, mainly in Hispanic residential neighborhoods were killed seven people within four months and two injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," told Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that the suspects has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence that they have been linked to the conclusion that attacks are linked up and committed by the same killer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalised with her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died still on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness the police informed that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie!</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I faced in the gymnasantry in the gymnasantry and that of more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I joined the Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turkeys, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess, and Madison Kocian, the Catholicas is round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, number one was under the female Turnerinside a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiad and the Americas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three fold world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as she was waiting, but masterful Gymasculine routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the tip of this sport, but we don't see gymnastics throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison a to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five," "" "because the next Olympics will only have four steps in the team. furthermore, it is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality is so that Turns become a more expensive Sport and Turner first line in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents, which are intended for training, training, travel clothing, competition, and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in a wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses, Turner will receive overall training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Bales, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since she started with the Turns.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired to the churches Aun countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a well-less and easily accessible gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turncitement 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events we have offered free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15,000 visitors (mostly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer to the young high-quality gymnastics that make the chance to learn from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinacy of mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of the crew, who bring thousands of young girls to interest for the gymnastics, and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" and thank you for making her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to get healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind it will show you this video as you turn the skewers for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you cross it from behind, you should turn yourself as a pathway, so that you can see your attackers and sit "out of the line" says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you beat it with your free ellbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then strike him with the knee into the chest, and turn down, while the attackers spread before pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run and move backward, while they set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">When attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the line, take the weapon and rotate them, so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler undernourished his immune system and Würgereflex a serious test - by taking some of the dirt and most spectacular places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, put his wake up on a Euro-loop, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, an rinse knob of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before deducting every object, he used a luminous plant to show and show us what it is settled.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the fling knob of a pull-out shit, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists on promoting intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left, what he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste of the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to flavoids of toilets, the task assigned to his immune system definitely under a rehearsal</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about what my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely just a righteous reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test screed showed a luminometerisation of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, Luminometerates fresh hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leave, after their Luminometerm was over 4000 units, whereas freshly used hands have a less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the Reisefilm "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this is the worst thing I have germinated in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no dirt as that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'll do nothing here, because it is ingenious here.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valid.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valid Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time the benefits of Probiotics explains.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy Brainstorings which ended that we told "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in health health is a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday area, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say," I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he would have tasted some of the things I would have directed to him, just like the tiny Russian toilet that will be shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things easier to bring Ian to get rid of them and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats in film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted in 2015, 84 percent of respondents were associated with lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="7">We always say that they are very Latin American.</seg>

<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays an older brother.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not receive anything from the Summer Choice campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">By 2021 the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the satin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because so far it does not go: summer holidays, heat and country swinging - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced by the elects are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers, who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen, or Hiddensee are not objectors, so don't choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There will be practical problems: in the holidays, the helpers will hang up, the posters will spread, flyers, and spread out at the end of the vote, only mühevoll.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to wait for a campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting how strong Neuling is to cut Afro, and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age, and since 2008, head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread roses and chat a little with the people, just as it did his most legendary Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors have cold feet and chancellor Merkel overthrew the debt on the bloom of Afro.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, you "We do this" have accelerated the rise of the populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make a wrong place at the right place of election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel to big search for Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Northeast Latvia.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxonia in Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority of other federal states," "" "Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to listen to Germany from other corners of Germany, even Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the northeastern CDU dispossessed largely to the usual election events on market places and before shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This means Kokert, plays only one "minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that, on the country, it has marked the base that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any of the country in the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU election campaign Kokert to his fellow soldier is also self-larvingly: "they must go there where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party needs to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is a lot in the game, Sellering has called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, S & D Group recently stood at 22 percent behind partner's CDU (25) and only just ahead of the Afro (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD won still clearly with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party of seven per cent in the polls, will probably do the leap into the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue from the holiday, and put up their campaign on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," calls the state of Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green elective warriors on track search for native voting rights among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gaek, the top candidate, curvt straight with a house boat through the mecklenburgian lakes and also finds it beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "electoral holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a sentence."</seg>

<seg id="8">This is also praised for the construction work, about when it comes to the establishment of containers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site opened on Monday to the south and also the blocking of Aspergyroad in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is once again, the traffic situation is relaxed within the resort.</seg>

<seg id="11">The road traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were partially significant complaints," "" "says that responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment, vice director Florian King." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The local residents of Bach's street, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had sought to fight more traffic noise, because many shots were sought and rather than the signs.</seg>

<seg id="15">Since the speed limit has not been kept, the community demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, however, it has become calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small solace that for customers coming from Rottenburg now the street is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 overhaul has led to revenues in revenues, each one wonders to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some are less affected.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all guest houses have met "hard."</seg>

<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all plumages, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history of history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now less subject to less than the complicated traffic, he can understand.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who does actually buy records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to inform him under the pseudonym-AlleEinsamenmen's age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the complex reconstruction of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials, which want to greet the novelty of physical objects, but due to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record, are all the foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely Käuble group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not hordes by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older flat runners keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGoals agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV I would follow me the camera while I stand in amidst a busy street in Soho, a humble grey suit, and make it wild, before I stand up, keep my hands and a certain determinism of how: "so let's throw a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos slowly hangs at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman, to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) to Reckless Records (data: eight men middle ages, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops around the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess" he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 and 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't followed him home), put the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy records, which he could not afford, when she was released and again buying items that he was sold when he was young and plexed.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are of the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably came too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true to those who buy records, rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my button.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25 who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that will meet YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also has a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations that I have led, people usually have defended themselves so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records back again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to the attachments of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like phonica to realize that record stores are a soothing community of equinders.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of trusted records from objects, of objects that are happy jugenders alert.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," Wez says.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's me as collectors and I think it's so many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "have a staff from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who have purchased a record last month they haven't listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll also found that 41% have a turntable whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy one plate, have no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while I blamed through a stack to Bossa Nova.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data of data: three men middle age) works, has a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came in front of us here and said," "" "I have no record players, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead Schallplatte, so I'd like to buy them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it's definitely going.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicians.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who first come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has an evil audience when I go clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, Teenagers and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesize and sexter pop rather than experimental jazz. it is good to see such diversität in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but brand psychic traumata are hard-determined if one stands for about 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for some minutes in business, and considers the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a mannequin as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so the collecting of records is no real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from one computer or another way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I admit the jeans to mugs the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young girls who group themselves at a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics which are essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far in the top that it is impossible to put it on.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, also that is the most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they let them, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, which exist in reality, record stores and in Onlineage.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bummeln by record stores of Berwick Street and leaves through plates, while she catches the gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who ascends about the shoulders above-standing men aged middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain during the 7-year rugby came to a corrupt hold at the last hurdle at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Fiji a master class in the handling, Side-Stepping, crutches, line-up and raw strength to win gold - the first Olympic Medal of each color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was dispatched by the not too bad consolation prize of silver medal - Britain fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this, in this form a 15-man team would have been defeated in top shape.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least one Brite will hang a gold medal for his neck: Fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former chef for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she was lost under Ryan each game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They only lost one thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">This folder will hurt, but the progress is astounding.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Fiji, wonderful and left the attacks GBS from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With only four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he turned.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly did the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A handsome Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third gate, but in Fiji it only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua sat down a Touchdown corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new time since the restart, and there was still about a minute playtime... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prepaid further weak tacings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, when Fiji was born to play the 7, while Britain has still been there.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time and ended the fijilian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua toured Tuisova after a brilliant stopplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was already long in favour of the South sesultians, whose fans sang and danced and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame replaced the i-dot with another attempt in recent seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whistle the whistle, Fijis impoverished and GB faked in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Early on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in semi-final with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a bald-finite match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half past, but Dan Norton took the line with an impressive footwork and achieved a gate among the position in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony des English 15-Aside teams, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no biologic gold as with these games, and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes up to the last, 220 hard Hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only those who were sitting at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent as they were in the second Olympics without tax woman in succession, the first women in the history of the British sports, which had such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, at least her 39.ter not lagged, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athqueens, leading over the surface with the elegance of gay, which is not reflected in the kind of triumphes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion to content that make the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who didn't know if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had the bladder cancer that is operable and they did so.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a quite awful situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that it could be the treatment beginning in 2014, outside the season, which could begin the interruption to a minimum, if that is the correct term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I stayed at the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing to itself is already a challenge, but that makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inability of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a more annoying morning to talk something more than otherwise, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, the centurion in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan" "", "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is perhaps something extremely, but it meant so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is only repeated how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore we are a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for coaching or better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the past 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to join, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were really caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, lead in the trial."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to rip itself.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for doing something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to do no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear on a wedding next week, her own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, health: singing senior citizens</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, teaching the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings among a senior citizen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotional and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels unbalanced, cheerful and more living, says she.</seg>
<seg id="5">Besides, she does something good in her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is like a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German retirement league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in choir and share the joy of music, describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Under the periodic interaction, seniors, social contacts can follow and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">For frequently, social and family structures are frequently solved, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of the company." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be stressful in the positive sense, Hackler writes.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever calls his lungs regularly, is not so fast in daily life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it is about getting the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the national labour community of the Seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher position, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people have aroused many memories, often associated with positive feelings of her youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By lyrics and especially melodies, people themselves demenstrued themselves demenstrued people in long lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing the head a special achievement is required, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrate on their own voice and to concentrate on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone are not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one finds through the singing in choir writes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem is also growing through the singing in choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I am long for something, I'm getting better and waxed about me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even when he thinks, little talent is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 sinful people who can hear when some sound goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, senior citizens offer various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone sing from the acquaintances in an retirement choir, you can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs also take place on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you have no access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet recherche.</seg>
<seg id="35">Everyone who lust has to sing, should be connected to a choir, betrays Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul well and has something liberating - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is not ensitive towards races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, it enables Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and with identities such a way that already borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a character that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unshimed, self-oriented tools which generate more than 30 million improved blfies per day.</seg>

<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past that they were accused of having to propagate the app Blackface-related or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week, some usurers hit a filter, which gave them slashing, false teeth and aroused cheeks, called there some critics a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowly."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether these repeated controversy raised up a larger problem, that the company has Diverse.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outstanding, which have experienced rattsm, the filter reminded of infringement clichés.</seg>

<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that this cultural Stolperate crossed.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment, which we all keep in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - those in the race, as their older defenders are - could rather go out to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats felt a picture, "so it is much more difficult for users to stay unnoticed when it was the case earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu decided to work as a product manager and engineering in the medium to delete your Snapchat account others asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a phone interview she said that they believe that rink-related controversy reflects a lack of diversität in the setting practices at Snapchat.</seg>

<seg id="24">"either she has no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Chu, "or they have people with other skin colors that are working there, but not in positions in which they are safe or feel good to say what to say."</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changes detailed information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were allowed to place in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Preliminary Report, created by a Task Force of the republican members of the Libyan members of the Security Committee, and reported by great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Services, reported to change their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"message Government Information that were cancelled due to high-level CentCom, recorded regularly, recorded a positional picture of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," quoted a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering, if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership defect in the CentCom range up to the top-top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips had given under Obama instructions to change the reports, as analysts look at the pressure from their forelaws, an optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were clearly positive than the facts" "" "presented the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom members publicly announced that a military recovery of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, this is much clear." said Mike Pompeo, republican congressmen from Kansas, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015, the points of Central Command changes the thoughtful report to record the danger by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force in life after they were played, analysts worries about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings and will be continued during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news agency published on Thursday their own findings, agreed with some of the conclusion of Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly limited process for the development of nachrichtenal appraisals to Isil and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest level Democrat in the county, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, as Mr. Schiff, "delayed the release of thoughtful reports," shook the morality among analysts and, "gave a little space for different opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and Democrats said to have no clues on an intervention of the White House on CentCom analysts in regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress of Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who received following complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press calls for the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspectors are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial debate on these important issues of national defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions for the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a assertion which has meanwhile made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year, however, have taken the question posed by President Obama to leave the Central Command for honourable assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>

<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, too late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanent and inevitably, a race-run relay between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which becomes a swimmers from the wristbands for the Turner's triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch on the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Leasey or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female carefull with dimples, could definitely be sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV commercials when he was a swimmers, gymnasts or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fought in the Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is lit up every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are sports that are not generally accepted: air guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breastfeed and may reign over it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest arguments for my particular love, then you let me give attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years so many believed that many of the ones I asked, didn't know that there is a Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, never won a medal in trampoline jumping and made a athlete until 2012, who made it up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolinjump has a certain outer lateral charms, partly because it sounds for the unresolved ear for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but I'm just a little bit of enthusiasts.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartoonous tremors of his never to end up - but also the Grazie of the gymnasium and taurine, the two sports that it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means a lot like" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Stripping victors jumping on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must end a series of falling movements (rotating, real and salad) before being landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are rated according to the official Olympiad to design, difficulty and" "" "flying time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vektor is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest to go beyond gold, go faster, up and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes go and back, downwards and down to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finishing line or the output wall, but in the TV broadcast another height goal: the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal of striving is nobel, marvelous, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir up a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is what I even more sensitive to see these games as a little tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A reverse movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she stooped down, seemingly heavy as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during the practice there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant raising time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will exert the final figures as part of a afternoon block at two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to oversee in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increasing awareness of male athletes can only be achieved through the anxiety and objecfication of male athletes - just like the male American Turner at the The Wall Street Journal recently proposed - then Mr Dooley expects his move to air, a new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protracted" in Ethiopia, Long a ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia, met for violent resistance in the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the protesters were killed during the clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to break down?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid consortium of West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the past months, protests against the government struck the country and expanded in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's answer was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen shoot armed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos across the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now asking an ongoing investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country and will soon become more difficult," Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is still the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopian to combat terrorist dangers beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in its remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new pendgame in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia had everything else than a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continually led the oppression with the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, dissidents were effective to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or into prison, or were driven into the wilderness by the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people, and these are no other options to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Boyoum Teshome, a teacher in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous discomfort that cover everything from the ground-use to the throws in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following an extensive election last year, the ruling party and its allies gain the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this torch, controversial line demanded hundreds of life in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are fearing that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced more or less on the last few years, could benefit the turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the provocation after years of Hinköchelns explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate via the social media, because cheap smartphones were increasingly more frequent and improved Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are located.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave to that they gathered so much protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Oons prospered the amharas that come from Ethopiens predominantly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are there to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up until his death in a non-publicity illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was viewed as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly vulnerable to use early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special contractor to cause enemies and to make it harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing on this fundamental idea," "" "Mr Abdi said, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively unclear reasons to increase the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Lord Meles, who came from the Tigray region of the North Sea, comes from Hailemariam from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many feared that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an uproar in 2005, after thousands against elections were protesting, according to the analyses apparently by the government, and then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razcia, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in recent months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commendment, as well as for their measurable advances in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not have the intention of intensification of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month of captured protesters in Gondar, an amharic town, of Tigray driven business, and hatred toward the tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests were the United States and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights to the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy clearly, he doesn't want to interrupt its ally in a volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama was founded ISIS is "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy against his campaign by giving his campaign, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification develops new questions about the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republicans, whether he is able to communicate clear and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow soldier, who endeavour to take him while an eventful phase in protection, to explain to the actual position, which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the announcement of a campaign events on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump made reference to the claim on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in a early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he's just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day, Mr. Trump said in a row of interviews, he meant the accusation entirely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican Presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The final storm of criticism against Mr. Trump descended, while he tries to focus the focus of his campaign due to falling sources to economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempted to return again to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm into his defence already.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he moved strong criticism against him when he said the Russians should wait Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he said, "Of course I said the sarcasus."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then turn back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans how they arrive, and then, if necessary" "" "clear" "" "according to what the reaction falls." "" "Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defuse the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive sound as its survey had gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a huge advantage in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally tempted to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distorted his statements or not to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he stands in focus on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps has brought his loyal Mitstreiter into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provokant his testimony.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent interviewers, received great effort to defend candidates today in CNN's interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr Giuliani said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in that sense, that before Obama ISIS is an almost unknown, small organization, he called her back benches, completely false and so it happened because he pulled off the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream-Republicans attempt to argue that the government ministered to Obama as Secretary of State, it allowed ISIS to spread out that the situation in the Middle East is aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, and designed them to fight on any of his words and to be biased.</seg>
<seg id="27">He defied the poor, junduary "television expert, trying to understand him and said," You can't. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked on Mr. Trumps excused as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rarely scenery.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea on board the Sanna research center.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims at least 1 km / h across the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-haie get only with 150 years old offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland sharks floating along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour he is at average 1.220 meters away.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five metre long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This longeful lifestyle seems to be a patent remedy for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report in the journal "Science" at any of a Greenland, 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock comments these lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland is become rock-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just lack the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time bends empties them when they held six animals in front of Svalbard for six animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this sharks still: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jaw of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly, they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice age and are looking for cadaver, which torches from higher water layers after downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatch from the north Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502-centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed using the carbon-14 methodology of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed already before the birth of the sharks which are contained in the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in lime-core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, their birth was supposed to be in the early 1960s, as nuclear tests try larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast, 220 centimeters length of the third smallest animal contained a minor surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All bigger Greenland's sharks in their lens had normal carbon-14 quantities that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland is an age of 335 years, while the Rekord-Hai should be 392 years old while the Rekord-Hai should be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females get until then when they are more than four meters, it was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to submit an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's sharks have obviously settled at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, placed in his bacon on the neck of a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught Alaska in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, often the body of the animals live on sparkles.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and slows slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal feed heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it as possible as possible as many offspring as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, a very large animal should rather invest his resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner raste last night in the Männerteam Sprint at Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the role of his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy, made the legend proud when he was home to home a victory of New Zealand's favorite New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed four years ago a shocking victory, while Hoy repeated the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repetitioned the trick, after returning in March at the London World Championships in London despite the return of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this time as an execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retires a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which she stayed when they saw potential in the gravel, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner set a Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds, but in the standarround winning the New Zealander in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap was barely back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a large part of transformation, when importing in a higher way to slow it, and Kenny, and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert from his position and fell Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes, when they rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We put an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes gave evidence that he fell to the railway after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later returned this statement later, and there was no appeal of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no problem with such a overlap victory.</seg>

<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were awarded seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If the barometer of our progress in the last five months is that we are expecting successful five days at the Velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kenny it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born March 23 (an apparently holy date for the British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The poodle of the Hoy right away.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="37">It was the only medallion competition of the day, but there were further good news for England.</seg>

<seg id="39">They came to the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, at which Wiggins continue with safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he was contested with the qualification before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate Women's competition that will continue and finished tomorrow, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team rely on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a donation to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After an extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven.</seg>
<seg id="46">They played Dramas in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April is amidst in the heart of sex and bulbinges as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks like the first night of the competition in Velodrome, it looks like the legendary reputation GBS, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, again to be repeated.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable by the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble from climbers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterproof surface and CO2-density atmosphere was once referred to in similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have shown earlier that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, inherent atmosphere, and still slowly turned around.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably proved more dry places than de earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from quorated.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus exponates its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio stated in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like a umbrella, around the surface of a large solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a story of Venus, which resembles Evolution, which was thought earlier by Planetarium research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years --much heat and ultraviolet light was exposed.</seg>
<seg id="15">The oceans evaporated and its water vapor was fired from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When you removed hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere was left to carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know them today.</seg>

<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients could be threatened by the loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims always:" "" "don't pay, you can only improve the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult, considering the standstill in operation the calls of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the F-Secure security researchers examined the user surface and contact with the erpressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay per Bitcoin, set free pre-access support sites for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will individuals pay for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to pay hard and pay five-digit sums to withdraw their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware-Disclaimer the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains safety-experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "one individual can write a ransomware about within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their pollutants software in the form of a software building to the actual erpresser.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits were created by the malware himself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes a adaptable, so that smaller configuration, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The erpresser then search for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you logged in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on possible many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per modified calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, criminals tolerate spammers with the spread" explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies responsible in the Malwarebytes survey trust in Ransomware using file back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Thus, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"when the encryption of data is not sufficient a threat to successful exploration, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or quotations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is the potential of damage, depending on the type of data, a more times higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also use their new goals in the internet of things on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the ground floor, Defcon demonstrated security researchers, as they could get connected to the Internet connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the fridges of a so blocked heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in the future instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, you are bound for ever, but at night you wake up to sleep, in the morning it is already far from the wake-up clingles to think about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all others as relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one has such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disturbances and more than 10 percent employing their sleep often or not recovering.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be certain causes of sleep, emphasized Hans-Günter Weaver, board member of the German Society of Schlasty and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what you understand, however, the Insomnie, therefore, is an input and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just to sleep through many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagner is a member of the board member of the German house medical association with practice in the Dutch varnish.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">It may cause organic, psychological or behavioral factors behind it, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not seldom, the sleep disorder is expressed by another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common especially for depression," says Weapes.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can be poorly lying, wakes up every two to three hours and starts blasting about everyday problems and -worry about everyday problems and worry, there is a cause.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep disturbances to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who should not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights a week, and the day should be impaired, advises advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: it is beaten, tired, disrupting, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in case of acceptance and most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Staying in Germany hardly, Prof. Ingo Fixes, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre at the Charité University Institute, Berlin, Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, at first time, you should first turn to the household dentist at first time, advises advises.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with investigations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should sleep in the sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For an investigation in the sleep laboratory, medical physician, for example, in snoring with breathing, at bedtime, at bedtime or when you do not find the cause of a sleepy disorder.</seg>
<seg id="27">We don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," says Fies.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabrid one goes to the bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes in the body one is wearing a nogoggles, chest strap, and a feelers at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is also a camera on the ceiling the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those problems get in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitches where you can attach for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weak counts on: regular sleeping and rise times, not to sleep long in bed, do not sleep on the bed, alcohol and don't throw at the clock - then you begin to count immediately, and that is quite and certainly not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbauten, a few lime trees, in between yet another head of the cobblestone: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain looks not so, but the police counts it to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>

<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: by 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy neighborhood" as well as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain is illustrated by burning cars in the last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">For the reason, the house is occupied with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants rented contracts, on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "since the beginning of the year, the Berlin" "" "no-Go zone" "" "for policemen and the 94 as the base of autonomous violence has been characterized as a tough approach towards the project." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadets formiths, had been cleared by 300 police officers, with 30 to 40 senior officials and three team cars on site, locked down parts of the street and attended visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown household owners are the premises.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers went under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road affects peaceful: parents walk with children, people sitting on the pavement at the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects an elementary school and kindergartens are located.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main attractions of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer lives that lives in the "Kiez," and Jana *, who plays here three children, are generously generated from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the building projects they share the concern of rising rying and genetic quantification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound after a "" "" Kiez, who wish to wish the majority of police protection from vandating left. "" "</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, whom the Berlin inside the city, and the police keep up between house heretic and their neighbours, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which is also today in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even homework and the native residential projects belong to the "Kiez:" in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former Democratic Republic, including nearly the entire Mainzer street close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police officers in a regular road battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly becoming a magnets for tourists and electreliner from all over the world: with them, local residents from the GDR times and former home offices share their "Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable by the rents, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they detect them in designed slices or freshly painted facades, which were subjected to dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned so often along with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason that not all neighbours will have the problem as a problem, might be that they are not affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively against police officers.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the crimes make atomic damage, the tense rather the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer who lives in a rental house beside the controversial 94 years, uncertainty can be no speech.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is complying: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they do not have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars also admit it directly in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For studying architect, its street is not a criminal force, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that local residents will return to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, in July all of them suddenly stressed the interpretation of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee guide</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the response partner in integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management of the management of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a partner for all actors: refugees, working for refugees, administration, authorities and who else can misuse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of working group indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, which has a problem of wool mild wool, which has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocked than rather impacted to the multitude of being targeted - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative department with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, a blasting wool milky.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative labor was not its central area, Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent job scheduled for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "Regine client says that Annika Deuschle honors and officials are supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers in the Wasenstraße soon</seg>
<seg id="17">There has been a serious problem for some time, apartments for connecting flights to find that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting rooms.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must undertake refugees in own or rented apartment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for building, rent or renovation of these accommodation must bear the municipalities itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the agricultural office to Commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not each owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been a very difficult time for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, there is no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">If so far, it is not required to rely on private apartments so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore general apartments must be used, as it is so nice.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, new containers are installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But with dwellings, it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a solid lead, internship places, training places, school places, one-Euro jobs and staff activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homework, do-profit work - and that motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But it does not work out work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a considerable feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, there are offers such as sport, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump in administration and honesty.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain the refugees that it takes time and they can make the time meaningfully overbridges, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who ever develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, I will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">There are also problems also, "says customer honestly," people, in which nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have been afraid of radicalization, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine client says very clearly," "" "what manoeuvre may call naïve." "" "a residuck could and if they don't want to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the terrorist attacks bring them complete.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they do not have anything to do with it," "" "Regine client says." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would happily stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, major and honorary posts must be held in the region and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they always have in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer, the politics are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we are not there yet, where we would like," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that Urbacher was able to procure the previous human beings so well.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they have to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
