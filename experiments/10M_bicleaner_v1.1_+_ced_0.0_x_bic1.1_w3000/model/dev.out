Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
they wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as over Tehran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
the meeting is also said to have the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ sion@@ ed for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the constant settlement of Israel and introduces Netanyahu &apos;s lack of tension in the peace process .
by Obama &apos;s armed deal around the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between them has further deterior@@ ated .
in March , Netanyahu again informed the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress , which was rated as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his friend got shot dead
in a emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb talked with a somewhat c@@ unning voice of the police , that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb , it was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; cute dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family @-@ contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and a handwritten note that was placed on a white block ; I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , and had already travelled for 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed by the police , where he was killed and killed at the door leading to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all the staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency recall some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when police en@@ cir@@ cled it .
a day after the shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers resort to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details presented by the agencies on the two ends of the state , such as what students and staff who knew him were willing to distinguish themselves , a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his classes .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , said he has no history or a criminal record .
he himself had mentioned a book written in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; which he shared his academic life .
both sub@@ contrac@@ ted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff consists of 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some clim@@ bs to problem@@ atic at@@ titudes .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who comm@@ ended Lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously requested the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has any health problem .
this year he only started two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy advised that the promotion , for which Lamb had been working hard for the Lamb , would not be a guarantee of an automatic way to being Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he has nothing about a conflict between married and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can &apos;t answer any more .
after the run out of the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs , as he rode back in Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as again .
before he could be arrested , killing self with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile to south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why lamb got to this house but Johnson said it believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
the Lamb opened its work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and fun .
Carla Vo@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb had been 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy , who was trying to teach her guitar game some years ago .
he was the women &apos;s black .
all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 , and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s gave obviously some time together .
in the call , Lamb said , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house which ad@@ joining a ba@@ the in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues .
Lamb met P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail advanced three years ago in a summer @-@ year market .
later they played one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he gave Lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s Night during the night of September 5th for the last time you finish his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a sp@@ aw@@ ful audience .
there was no evidence that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the ti@@ fts and were jo@@ yed each other .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester programme program , speci@@ alising in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English teacher at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and served as President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday , about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including teachers , employees , students and members of the church at a cand@@ el@@ ight commemorative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts woman Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the remin@@ ders , while the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang .
the instruction will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Just in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect the police now says that Lamb had killed the emergency after he had shot Schmidt , and that the lamb described in his emergency call P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s than his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less labour force for Christmas time

Michael J. Fox sei@@ zes his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theatres waiting for the roy@@ als and I realize that the seat is empty beside me , and it will gradually be clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated track and an arm length of it , to be with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spielberg .

UN boss says , there is no military solution in Syria
ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons are afflicted by violence and mis@@ ery to millions of people .
the UN leader calls once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support a political solution for finding a political solution .
ban on a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the si@@ delines of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
he de@@ pl@@ ets that the adv@@ anc@@ ements in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers can make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot;
ban took on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity by the managing the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated by having nuclear agreement with Iran .
8 Refer@@ ences , showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some people wait for a collapse .
but no matter how several Republi@@ cans attempt to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges at p@@ olls , it did not work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously consider what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate @-@ Mog@@ ning .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts not@@ ices that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given guidance to the rising Herman Cain , none of which won only one state in the nomin@@ ee process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but external transfer groups such as J@@ eb &apos;s Super P@@ AC , and the conservative Business Group Club for Growth now realize Tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and start to run their dollars flowing to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some recent ad@@ ditions that indicate that the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary stage :
m@@ umps regarding popularity characteristics have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
early August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
the Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of p@@ umping .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P were happy with b@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when she was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as p@@ umping ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of republi@@ can voters say they &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ ys &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees Tr@@ umps tem@@ per as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the voters will believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is the right temper@@ ament for President , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first country state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of re@@ public@@ ans think that he has a Commander in Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his position , and almost six out of 10 dependent claims that his temper@@ ament does not go into the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they keep their money hon@@ esty , Republican voters think Tr@@ ump to real .
if asked , who will be asked to win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee , say about CNN &apos;s / OR@@ C out of last week it &apos;s four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten completed her money on eb &apos;s Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not have the clear crystal ball .
at that time in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans believed that Rick Perry won the nom@@ ination of being 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a multitude of GO@@ P @-@ voters will have a swe@@ eping campaign than chat .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everybody .
some experts refer to the breaking field probably contributing to Tr@@ umps , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump @-@ support is spread over more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , p@@ umping the majority support .
he pointed to Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , especially Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Edge Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ in head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head .
a tight majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump fans says that they have made their opinion .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters that support tr@@ ump could say that they have forgiven their voices .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say , never change my opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ der , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind , are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with b@@ ump at the topic of immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump has been arrested in his election campaign , two months ago immigrants from Mexico , &quot; the immigration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course was launched in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic ou@@ trage of the p@@ inc@@ est His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans are re@@ mot@@ ely controlled by the Republican Party and damage the re@@ ori@@ enti@@ ment efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post Office of Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with p@@ umping in issues of immigration .
so long as the migration remains in the spot@@ light , there will be Donald Tr@@ ump apparently .
the fru@@ stration about the government clim@@ bs up to new high@@ s .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now ent@@ ails around half of the support of republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ der status .
&quot; &quot; &quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday survey on ABC / Post they rather want to have a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa 2 weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Republi@@ cans were fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent &quot; balanced . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg are the most expensive residential community with view over the North Sea .
on the street , a square metre space villa on average is 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer to objects naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - hence the high price .
a new study shows in which particular layers are one square meter most costs .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top housing locations , however , one of the price does not occur .
the Real Estate provider Angel@@ s &amp; Nations has published a leaderboard for the most exclusive German residential sites - at square feet in a dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several of ten thousand euros per square meter , mind you .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception here at the top .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two double go@@ ings in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller ra@@ ined the way to a comp@@ acted 3 : 0 with the Olympic Games Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze portra@@ yed a dream first in the &quot; mission of Milan in the magic chair of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off play in the Champions League with the Greek Record @-@ Master Olympics in a hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Divine matches ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th race success in series is to be the first step towards the Fin@@ als on May 28 , 2016 where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola is finally trying to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t in Munich .
in his 28 matches in the Champions League , the Bavaria @-@ guiding hand @-@ help of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ keeper Roberto , who suffered a f@@ lange of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the play in Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 6@@ 88 hot@@ ly fans - and the Munich @-@ based word stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated not@@ ion , without g@@ listening .
Pi@@ raeus had won his recent six home games in the Royal Class , including famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund was proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
yet , the Bayern , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victims .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often to inv@@ inci@@ ble efforts in their aggressive efforts .
these attacks were often diver@@ ted by playing time on the link outside of Douglas Costa , which Omar El@@ ab@@ el@@ a@@ ou@@ i , an earlier Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ el@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had left no more fortun@@ ate than his flan@@ k from the right hemisphere at the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , when the Olympics &apos; Der Stür@@ mer Brown defeated the head ball from Poland ( 26th ) .
then , by direct contact , the go@@ al@@ keeper will be par@@ ted with the kne@@ e ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bayern rented its usual game , Pi@@ raeus could set con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous stit@@ ches .
but on Tor@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Barroso , however , was deser@@ ved .
for instance , when he donated a shot from ide@@ books on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
new ago , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a square chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back to muscular problems in the ca@@ sia , was initially sitting outside .
the World Cup hero was given a green light only after finishing the green light , but Matthias Sam@@ mer said : &quot; he who wants to make something else of it is already v@@ icious . &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola chose him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the nom@@ inees of Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear for 13 minutes later by El@@ f@@ lap Müller again .
before the game , T@@ ie was celebrated in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly f@@ um@@ med Bavaria @-@ fans in their spect@@ ator , the supporters of hosts Pi@@ raeus having prov@@ oked with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with ra@@ vines against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bavaria @-@ Fan was hurt in the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
those who smo@@ kes , hurt not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that makes a Pots@@ dam@@ er long term study near .
good news : in case of ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk sin@@ ks up fast .
smoking have a notably higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking , smoke was the risk of losing their teeth in pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly , around 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists have observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of loss of teeth are dental c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ ing@@ i@@ val , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , bet@@ ting the authors .
the link between smoking and dental loss is therefore backward in common g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
not explained , however , smoking does not increase the risk of dental c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking by smoking could reduce their risk in short time , writing the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could only last for ten years until the endanger@@ ment came back to the level of non @-@ smoking , the first writer Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must convince people of it to be non @-@ smoking , stated in the H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge , too , to good old dental health .
in Germany over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of disease affected has been affected by DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already noted that smoking lowers the risk of early age failure .
the new long @-@ term study guide the findings .

EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current Ar@@ bit@@ ration system on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private rest@@ rooms for disp@@ utes between corporations and states are expected to be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes in its functionality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the competent EU @-@ Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish announced the proposal to negoti@@ ate the EU negoti@@ ating position as a European negoti@@ ating position with the United States .
the German government announced support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TTIP will be the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans on the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure clari@@ fies specifically that the EU states and the U.S. will jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Tribunal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and third countries .
it is planned for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against original parts .
so far , the process involved agreed on the refer@@ ee , a claim against their jud@@ gements .
in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , they will go to an international capital court according to their own information .
there could then be clari@@ fied in disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) particularly demanded the major reasons for major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ es are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , by the companies damage the tax@@ pay@@ ers to the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national spro@@ uts , or reducing consumer goods or environmental standards .
in the first opinions , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act agre@@ es to in@@ adequate the proposals of the European Commission .
the trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) should be critici@@ zed for the already @-@ managed free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Müller ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a great progress .
the Commission , considering the reform of essential points , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of Private Ar@@ bit@@ ration would be from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European Business Association in Business@@ Europe warned against to limit the applications of economy by too many new rules .
this means that small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this , it called .
the talks about the TTIP would be concluded ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) concluded , continued un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed yet with the United States .
originally a framework for the agreement should end at the end of this year .
this date is regarded as no longer viable .

next to him , a fli@@ pchart , that has recorded in@@ timi@@ date the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt @-@ shiel@@ ding folk @-@ singer .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost affected by Stev@@ ens lecture .
he tells about different places that he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ed and delicate songs will be reported .
where they arose , and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens has become more creative and more creative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 2003 and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plays a clever songs , harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always be an opul@@ ent drift . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rum@@ our arises , &quot; Michigan , &quot; the first part of a we@@ ath@@ ered series : each of the 50 US states should be discussed in a row .
but even in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; seven sw@@ ans &quot; had already been released and has a positive impact .
Stev@@ ens is reduced here .

a year later , the musicians who live in New York will return to the series .

Over@@ bearing on ideas and styl@@ is@@ tical fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any year list of the influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) , extensive electronic through@@ put .
this sixth studio album is still being orchest@@ rated , yet orchest@@ rated by programmed sequences or beats , and plays with all the effect and hall .
recently the smaller clubs were being de@@ af@@ ed , the stage shows of Ne@@ on @-@ Fore@@ ver change and large @-@ fluorescent stage sets .
currently touring Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the theatres presents mainly the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the Stev@@ ens converted back to in@@ timacy and folk music .
without jud@@ ging a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the wide @-@ enriched album .
you can hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can handle the &quot; plate in principle . &quot;
only to its addition , Stev@@ ens says modest , plays acou@@ sti@@ cally , less older songs and eventually ten@@ ds to applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ no &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ no &apos;s debut in the president of the Prime Minister is anticipated with tension
the new Labour MEP , Jeremy Cor@@ ren@@ n , will debut his debut at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister and gave himself for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to give the first of its six pre@@ given questions shortly after lunch , with the performance of the media probably and the Labour MPs out of the vicinity .
he called &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could safely ski@@ p some sessions to leave them up colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination of Mr Cor@@ ren@@ ns leadership because she is named after his appointment to a member of the shadow , and following his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision was prov@@ oked in silence at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the centre of several titles stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ ren@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention to itself
a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he has stood &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ic of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ ren@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , pointed out in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the National An@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective of his faith that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ ren@@ ns , and it appe@@ aled to differences in economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Opposition was originally supported as leader .
the political correspon@@ dent for the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also differ within the Labour &quot; position on the position of the European Union and the limit on winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour amendments suggested to remove all the idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labor and pensions , said the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Socialist leader , David Cameron , who has been a T@@ ory leader in the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament over the past decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chairman , who promised to another policy approach , says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions in Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the president of the Prime Minister is confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is under@@ lined both &quot; perc@@ ussions &quot; and the stre@@ wn with resistance and instead , has to focus on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadows of economic affairs , is represented by him , if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example if Mr Cameron is on the way abroad .
he has also advised the idea that other colleagues sometimes seize the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre . &quot; but a few years later he admitted that he failed in her .
since it was broadcast on TV first in 1990 , the pon@@ ies with the prime minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment and his position in the lower chamber under his parliament , although critics have argued that it had become a caric@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

the pound has risen sharply to data , which is an increase in the wage growth in the UK . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the Z@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s goal .
between May and July , the result , excluding bonuses in the United Kingdom , grew by 2.9 % against the same period of the same period last year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most advanced app@@ rais@@ als of an interest rate since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .

the leader of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are dangerous .

but it is unlikely that this department will pay the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

top@@ ida poster contains Lebanese for potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it &apos;s both - and the potato h@@ ön@@ er , who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ant Han@@ i Al@@ hay , who is in the potato h@@ ön@@ er .
inspired by the phrase &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; on a poster by the movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put on a sp@@ ear .
the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen randomly on television .
since then , the store is turning into a barbecue sweat , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has meanwhile grown to Lebanon in the patent office in Munich .
since then , according to the authority , it has been protected as utility models .
how much flesh and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer will contain , that doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y Al@@ hay .
only so much : &quot; it tastes still better , &quot; he finds .
among his clients , the culinary international understanding is good .
Met@@ cash launches floor plate campaign to fight against ageing
Met@@ cash is trying to protect IG@@ A branches off a Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ whol@@ es@@ aler Met@@ cash has started a bas@@ al gra@@ vation campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets have prepared their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing through social media alike , as well as events like Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jumping on board , with brands such as ice @-@ maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ un@@ borough , who distri@@ butes samples and shop owner , who used to sell tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of his defense strategy on September 29 , if the whol@@ es@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices carried out its annual Invest@@ ors Strategic Day .
it is much in the game , because South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop stores and higher profit mar@@ gins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 per cent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley is expecting around five percent of the food market in these two states after opening his first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers to take away .
according to a report published this week , the analyst Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley is estimated that IG@@ A retailers can lose 360 million annual revenues per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in the food and grocery store and amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of the high fixed @-@ free fixed base could cost Met@@ cash approximately $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash lost market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent pol@@ l conducted by Roy Morgan was that IG@@ A buyers are the protests .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to van@@ ish within a decade .
Met@@ cash dis@@ agreed to respond openly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass is last week in contact .
IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food@@ stuffs and food trade , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction in similar pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers are restra@@ ined and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ in order to improve selling prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ le@@ ths for hundreds of products each week , and IG@@ A retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that price adjustments and loading san@@ ier@@ programmes are expected to grow and hopes that whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to a winning growth in four years in the first four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise than criticism for his behavior .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als damage &quot; in the shorter storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves to be praised by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather than criticism for his own behavior .
the younger of the talented Du@@ os , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , is repeatedly described as &quot; Special KS &quot; was going into the spot@@ light by the not@@ orious dispute with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after that , Kok@@ ra@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated from the refer@@ ee , whereby Harrison had to suggest : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA has to propose the Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should propose the child . &quot;
while he was seen as he had seen a tennis ra@@ cket , after a motorcycle was defeated a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ected by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against UK .
&quot; one thing about which I am reas@@ oned , the fact is that after my mind Than@@ ksgiving entered a little entered the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken up a ra@@ cket when he lost a sei@@ z@@ ure in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket from the fru@@ stration with himself and I know Than@@ ksgiving well enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around itself , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very lovely 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he doesn &apos;t have a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in form , it is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mis@@ services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to do not take into account the very important decision on Friday which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; joint decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right to everyone , but he secu@@ res Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm to return to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all about the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe Nick has succeeded very quickly , on what people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he increases in the eyes of the public , but we try to support him , we try to make him the consequences of its trading . some time outside the spot@@ light , where he can only think about it , I think it appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , stops the border , keeps refugees
Hungary explains the emergency number and , by destroying the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that they tried to get illegal into the country . all with the aim of stopping the migrants &apos; flow .
chaos followed the limit , when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials with indig@@ nation .
the people who escaped from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a rural strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents .
but fru@@ strations rose .
as a police helicopter above them floating , the migrants &apos; opening the border ! &apos; and cried out against the police .
some were returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would arrive during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral harm .
it must take place in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serb border arrived one day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a strict meeting in Brussels won no common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who had sought refuge in the out@@ dated Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be reached by the EU states to take another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary however , restored its hopes on an early action of Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency number issued on Tuesday sent more authority to prevent crisis in two southern regions , so that they could accelerate roads and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country was also planning the construction of a bar@@ bed wire bridge along its border to Romania , in order to stop the flow of migrants from the country - after it has ended a fence along the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison charges at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in the past months , Hungary has become a large number of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a substantial bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry down to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that the majority of the coming economic refugees are looking for better life and non @-@ war refugees that are entitled to protection - a view which is strongly contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ ourselves , who built the government along the southern border with Serbia , commit to a crime . these laws also establish higher adher@@ es for convicted traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation that was created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs reports in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must not agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with cars and dogs already on day .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land security adviser for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were attempting to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come across as they damage the fence , they are now in custody to police and are accused of off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are working quickly to repair the fence .
in the morning , two of the seven border payments with Serbia closed on Tuesday , after a tractor trailer with bar@@ bed wire , to close the borders .
chaos linked the most important Gren@@ zen@@ los near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary had opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd pressed to push himself there .
around 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside .
another group of immigrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they may travel to Hungary .
vote 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre@@ diction ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced himself to be can@@ di@@ ted for the Presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of democratic voters for the election .
more than five months before the start of the preliminary election , most democratic voters say that too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates are willing to support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more constant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ ander achieved some profits .
Clinton holds a great advantage in women and more moder@@ ates , but this approach has decreased .
their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders are only with 5 points behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s benefit at democratic voters under the age of 50 has ch@@ qu@@ ered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton had a big lead over the older voters .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead over the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in that group .
about half of the democratic voters in the country are saying that they would support him with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support them with some reserved and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ di@@ ate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters can especially be inspired by her .
the views are stronger than those who do not support Clinton - only about one quarter would it enthusias@@ tically support .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , they say less republi@@ can voters for their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question is asked why they want it , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
thanks to Clinton &apos;s support , her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
consent to dealing with the problems and the voters are also cited .
as the vice president raises the potential for the Presi@@ dency in the scales , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
when democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
from Clinton &apos;s followers said more than half that Bi@@ den would be the second choice far from S@@ anders .
decides not to can@@ di@@ ct himself for nomin@@ ating the demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead against S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ den in the race on 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters think Clinton &apos;s vote in the best chance to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , during the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call a question about the voters .
likewise , as in the last month , no one democratic candidate or a potential candidate for those elec@@ torate is unacceptable .
the Democratic Can@@ did@@ ates or potential candidates bring good results with some important traits of voters for their party &apos;s election .
many habits consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with strong leadership .
among the three candidates , Bi@@ den pays the lead to hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons strength is the guide .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters in general election in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion about S@@ anders .
as questions concerning Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Secretary of State , most of the Democratic voters are pleased with their declaration of matter and say that their opinions is not affected .
but it is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem of light came , was split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy has no effect on her general opinions from Clinton , even though 36 percent said that their opinion of it still wor@@ sen@@ ed .
they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of entitled voters do not hold them for an honest and trusted individual .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled voters will also be compl@@ ained about tr@@ ump and non @-@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and tr@@ ump received good notes on leadership .
of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut their best hon@@ esty .
a majority think S@@ anders more than hon@@ estly , but as at Car@@ son do many of him have no opinion about him .
the rate of trouble for the sample of 351 Parliamentary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves ahead to Donald Tr@@ ump in Poland
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the two Can@@ did@@ ates , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
republi@@ can voters continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support increases from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News debate in the past month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son joined demo@@ graphic groups well and will be p@@ umping over republi@@ can voters in higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , Governor John Ka@@ es , is beaten with Wiscon@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who at the lowest is fallen from 10 % to 2 % last month .
former Florida Governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % .
the trouble @-@ margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons by the Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey that has been published last week shows that Car@@ son raises in the p@@ olls - he comes with 19 % support in the Republi@@ cans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey on ABC News / Washington Post also showed , p@@ umping very much before Car@@ son .
at a glance at the Car@@ son rising in the past week , Tr@@ ump found some page thi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son g@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question the m@@ umps on question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant swimming pool : the eastern Mediterranean sea is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is sufficient to present hot water .
a bathroom in North or Baltic sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
there is no more view to the sea : maximum 18 degrees cel@@ sius the water in the north and Baltic Sea during this week , share the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
on the other hand , next to the Mediterranean sea : in the east , even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is at the tip of 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood in@@ crimin@@ ated the death of a Bar@@ uch college ne@@ ul@@ ing
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ avo ritual with student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed away , murder actions are filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch college P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood is brut@@ alized during an introduction ritual by September 2013 and delayed its transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police viol@@ ated .
officials said he had been loaded with blind@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound bag full of sand and was repeatedly attacked , while trying to access a frozen field on a frozen field .
after all , Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about headache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood call not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was s@@ wo@@ oned and waiting for an hour before they brought him to hospital , so the police .
however , they had time to change d@@ eng@@ s clothing , his symptoms of goo@@ dies and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to contact the council , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at that point , the members of the utensils were forced to hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle through Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been added with bl@@ unt force injury , tor@@ so , and upper th@@ igh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died since 1970 every year to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ic@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brothers and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and that step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury County recommended a charge for murder of the third density for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indicted for har@@ vest@@ ing attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the involved people , but if there is an organization that has - officially or in@@ officially - this is sanc@@ tioned by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood rejected its affili@@ ation to the local group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest
a interest rate will come , and the house will fall into the wan@@ ing , ren@@ ders for bonds , and the economy will lead into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will last and how long it will stop .
especially , the history of the economy is only a small guide to the procedure .
the recession produced a recession within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor will react like the economy and financial investments .
therefore , representatives of the US central bank have so fierce that investors should not focus on it when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was perhaps exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is being interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Julian J@@ ess@@ op said at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
contrary to this , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still on low level to lead the seis@@ mic shock , which many seem to be feared .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here , a view of historical trends is based on how some areas of economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate things can be made for a while .
once the increase is hits , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a trend that assets decreased from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a recent study on what happened after interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely in recent 35 years , the market is generally down@@ ward - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days ( average profit from 14.@@ 4 percent ) , then return to an average return in recent six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ances &apos;s asset management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects of the shares will occur later in the increases of increases and the return of return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but interest rate increases them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that could not happen before and could accelerate a recession .
particularly not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in the F@@ ed interest rate .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rate increases since 1950 , and only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , we expect that this will happen and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter following the release of Atlanta .
Zin@@ c &apos;s increase in such frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and cast the question : &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have made the whole year on a interest rate by F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could make an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade show only a 25 per cent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increases cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing vibration in GDP and before the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , this is definitely a slow revival of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession . the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed in@@ comes also was vol@@ atile as the market under@@ takes a interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the key difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares if they change its strategic course .
in bonds , Ren@@ di@@ ets seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increases the attachment falls immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
strateg@@ ists from Charles Schw@@ ab have believed that the rise in rates of interest is expected that ren@@ ders rise closer between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve .
highly @-@ interest bonds bear often even better yields in such a climate although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ ses at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
what is interesting is that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the dollar &apos;s strength and the decline in inflation devices there are some evidence that the market has adjusted to stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing have expanded , and the vol@@ atility has increased , all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that are losing the larger part of their business activity in the US will benefit , if interest rate increases and local products become more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts will be worse , as an increase of dollars will make its products more expensive on the global market and also funding of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history demonstrates that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond extremely positive three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts in a report for the clients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet having achieved an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital ren@@ ders as well as low vol@@ atility by their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts of low average percentage ( percentage points each ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high percentage of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
just outside the clean stock games consumers are also benef@@ iting from the growing dollar .
save profits by higher yields , even if experts are in different opinion , how fast this will occur .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ atives of Parliament critici@@ zed the transmitter for its &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argued that he is not to distinguish from commercial rival .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ ited The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Collins with the Voice The Voice on and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts to Classic FM , claims a leader of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that will not do the private .
the con@@ doms of Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC Bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster Radi@@ os@@ er is being di@@ gest@@ ed , and increasingly , no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ly - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be the Br@@ its under another name .
so , if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontane@@ ously called examples , in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competition when it comes to public music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I don &apos;t want to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music , which is truly unbe@@ atable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , new music and new works on behalf , I can also be really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller argued Alan Dav@@ ey , that he had to work harder to engage with the audience than doing this in the past , because the British informed less about classical music .
but radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , while hearing the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , under fire , the commercial rival took place on his feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins from the Voice on - the musical talent show of the BBC , who was purchased from Dutch producers Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced on a special BBC way .
he added , he would like the company to find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; when it comes next time a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from The Voice in the future or give money of the fee credits for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August by the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday ri@@ pped the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping is o@@ om@@ t , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets are transformed into the ghost town .
but experts say that there are now signs that the online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the overall expenditure for August presented the lowest in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the years and back in 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index by The Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he declared that online sales started more than three years ago as a buyer started to purchases their cell sales .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example , at home on the sofa .
but now it moves out , and we may see that growth is reduced .
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the completion sales .
experts believe buyers will return their purchases before this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , fifth time saw the average number of buyers around their computer to make their mou@@ ld@@ ings , and some dealers had collapsed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers had v@@ ici@@ ously fighting for bar@@ gains , buyers would stop shopping .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spending a little more than £ 1 online .
several products such as TV and washing machines are now being conducted more than one @-@ third of shopping .
at the same time , more than a quarter of man buys clothes and shoes online instead of being in the fashion chain .
Muslims buried in Mecca for the crane accident of killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned .
the bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial cases in Mecca .
Saudi Arabia maintains the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed
hundreds of Muslims were gathered together when 29 of the victims were borne by the streets to bury them killed when a crane collapsed on the Mecca of Mecca .
filled , filled , mainly in white robes , the circuit to c@@ ate their respect , when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m @-@ cemetery .
the funeral pro@@ c@@ ession passed by the Holy Place where only days ago a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed collapsed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , the Saudi King above the construction company of the bin Laden , owing to the catastrophe which left the last 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 persons , which were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central mosque in Mecca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , sank the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already noted that the add@@ ling to Mecca with thousands who continue to enter the city .
today king Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group said , should not suffer the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an Arabic version of the decree that was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group is responsible for the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking Service Agency does not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man went to reveal what over@@ threw the fall of the crane , which collapsed in a courtyard of the big mo@@ g@@ é where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ling that later this month .
the Bin Laden group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ aired the group because of not current security measures , because it has not collabor@@ ated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes sur@@ round Mek@@ &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ z@@ ee as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia family for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the late leaders of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a retired son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane collapsed in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of any healthy body .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials arrived that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) pay to the relatives of the killed and the same sum of permanent injuries .
other injuries get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Brit@@ ons become increasingly tra@@ des@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has increased significantly
this means that 200 additional screens , which are aimed at craftsmen , will be opened .
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q displays nationwide participated in Poland
Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Head Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it says that Br@@ its do their h@@ amm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brush in support of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen that perform the work in their home .
if you are sent to a hammer or a brush to attach walls , you seem to be a minority today .
because British employ more and more skilled workers to do DIY jobs in their homes , so the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the tre@@ k @-@ chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified ar@@ tis@@ ans from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices would be out@@ dated .
as a result , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops are planning to open ar@@ tis@@ ans and close to 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the shop are met by women .
at the moment , men weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to provide a growing demo@@ graphic trends that are increasing the more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it &apos;s still a majority of men in our branches .
we have to push this stronger towards a balance .
in general , half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a large role in decision making .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , also has its top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in executive positions .
it is almost the only company that had occupied only 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is here an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group ow@@ es the costs for the closing of shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of a@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the regional court Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball player a@@ I / DO@@ B have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public debt .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of ten@@ dering .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused was cryst@@ all@@ ised in the preliminary investigation that the accused were allowed to disp@@ ose of the United Nations in the years 2006 to 2011 , which they had allowed in their function , for private purposes .
it will damage the damage with approximately 400.000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial charges .
this fac@@ tum was par@@ ted out on the Chairman of the scho@@ oner , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
at the point of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence appe@@ aled the case that no point of war was found at no time .
the sports officials have only disp@@ osed of allow@@ ances and the sports club for whom it had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money from the liabilities - the liabilities were approximately 600.000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( RD : 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : &quot; we carry on the club until we closed ? , &quot; he told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ based financial calendar of the financial system .
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he then decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have created money , our life insur@@ ances served as security for the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the capture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
be agreed with the association : you can manage the money free , it cannot be done any debts .
moreover - with the financial - success the payout on allow@@ ance compensation had been fin@@ alised by 1991 .
therefore you have only paid a part of the allow@@ ance compensation until 2003 , when a plus was at the account was paid out .
therefore , flat and non @-@ detailed comments seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the guards sum@@ med up the two accused , said the second def@@ endant .
why the withdraw@@ als were not explained in detail in detail , the Judge asked .
the association was not interested in detail for financial donations , so important was only the debt of debt , so the answer .
therefore , in 2011 , a mandate of over 120@@ ,000 Euros was opened to the association &apos;s account in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros depos@@ ited to the association &apos;s account .
the indic@@ ative were there , the def@@ endants were declared .
this securities register went on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to the organisation &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; she wanted to know the judge .
Wher@@ eu@@ pon , the respon@@ dent knew not an answer .
then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody wanted to know anything of that money , the public prosecutor posed in the space .
the co @-@ def@@ endant was informed , the func@@ tionary of the func@@ tionary .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation restore . &quot;
why does damages ? , Judge and the Prosecutor wanted to know .
the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the club has never been a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the Adv@@ oc@@ ate says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
moreover , he said the func@@ tionary , he has never related a cent salary , but he only has o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
at the di@@ ets he charged the club 1,000 euros per month in the bill , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not suggest the def@@ endants .
these are after a private inspection in which everything was judged correctly , no longer been kept , declared they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter money had also been involved in the second def@@ endant .
all containers may be converted in cash , along with the bank from his home village to lead to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue on September 23 , with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for US @-@ bank@@ note bank
the world is observed , when the US @-@ bank@@ note stood at two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were interro@@ gated by Reuters , found that a bit more than half , which was still last week of view , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to remain somewhat longer , and the interest rates will last at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest earned interest .

accus@@ ation at the Delta State University in the background of ap@@ ologies
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi , Monday morning , and before he later killed his colleagues , Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; I &apos;m sorry for the first murder and wanted it , &quot; he could not do it , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , he shot at any one , and one was put to death .
lamb said the staff of the emergency department , that police have to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet little dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but he will distur@@ b no one , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but likely to be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police asked the c@@ aller to his name , but he didn &apos;t .
Lamb showed no explanation for his shots .
when police came across the scene they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I do so sorry , I wanted to be und@@ one .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the noti@@ fied 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he e@@ thane Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officers en@@ cir@@ cled him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he has nothing about a conflict between married and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence of &quot; a &quot; tri@@ ec@@ cent@@ relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s has been described by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who had been married seven years ago as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground .
he said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were her daughter , &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s worked online from home , named Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les that was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s .
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , has met him for about three years ago with a Lamb .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
the police said that married had arrived at a certain point on Monday to say , &quot; he is not going into prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen arrived at the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , he drove his car to the side , fled towards foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group to Lufthansa
the Lufthansa plans a major corporate group .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in a year alone with a better organisation .
the company &apos;s workforce comprised over 150 executives around the world .
there is a new negotiations with the pilot work .
Lufthansa uses its corporate structure to enhance and utili@@ ze Euro@@ wings &apos;s equity security .
the real@@ ignment is due to a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year , cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , the Lufthansa takes no position for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings will be easily developed as stand @-@ alone as possible .
in the board of managing Director Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Mor@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
with the new setting , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings to compete in the future against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 staff was complex .
the airline issued a name under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , which accounts for three @-@ quarters of annual sales of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
the conflict with the pilot of the pit ( VC ) negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday strike on this Thursday .

Luke Shaw by Manchester United can &apos;t play for double Fra@@ k@@ tur
Luke Shaw met with the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven a double @-@ cont@@ our of his right leg .
while the left of the left was brought to wines and exclu@@ des it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Shaw can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Shaw was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was covered nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before being transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg bend and lies at the hospital . &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe a day later and then in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 at Manchester United , playing it very hard and then play fantastic , and then it happens .
in the changing cabin he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double balance , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno appeared happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a eleven milli@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had been wrong .
you can judge for yourself , when I say that a eleven meter and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I &apos;m , my path to the recovery begins now , I come back more again . &quot;
in fact : Manchester United has donated the loss of Luke Shaw during the defeat at PS@@ V
the British def@@ ender has an additional inc@@ entive in France with the European Championship in France to recover from coming to come .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves that kind of injury the place is all very sad .
it &apos;s never the goal of our players to harm a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a hit break when Mexico had played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very aw@@ ful injury , this is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coc@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was moving in another direction , so it looked like him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
speaking with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad . I &apos;m so tired .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing to learn all parents : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t last long until you know it almost completely .
unless you are , you may be with David Cameron .
when he was asked to call a supplier of child care systems , his favorite child@@ r@@ ens book was called , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it &apos;s always a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph describes the action of the book , instead of giving a content of the 2012 film version , added the new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the heart of the Moor@@ ish city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a merchandise , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey to see her desire to see a true tree , &quot; reads &quot; Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was , and the 1991 passed away , but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t susp@@ icious enough : the text of Cameron is reading itself as a summary of the Lor@@ ax movie that will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database where everything is artificial and even the air is a merchandise , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey to win the girl of his dreams .
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems that Cameron stands out of the book as little . here , an un@@ named boy , as the local environment shall fall through the money @-@ gre@@ edy , pe@@ eling stri@@ cken eyes , &quot; which speaks to the name of the trees , &quot; rav@@ aged by the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has read The Lor@@ enz almost 20 times after a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said that the text was probably came out by Cameron &apos;s electoral center .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ens staff was delivered , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was am@@ big@@ uous by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult .
to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you selected the Kad@@ esh , England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series does not appear on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a reverse win .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page may be less experienced than those three years ago but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing Report and the Community spirit is strong ; they will not carry cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ ors Ali develops as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
report related to this news : Adam Ly@@ th ends from England &apos;s Test Ka@@ det and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
making the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course to be regarded as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ actors are targeted at results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told it to him - players who choose their own best selection .
long ago , we have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he strikes yet further orders for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance come out .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor of Bay@@ l@@ iss comm@@ ended his post@@ ure , even though he did not give so good performance , and this is not surprised ; he is primarily a team man .
the question , how much time does a test bomb gets to place its character , is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton received the chance for home and moving .
the only accus@@ ation that you can rise was that England first introduced Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Cari@@ bean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a bu@@ zz I am highly advised .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ mp player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire , soon in this season , when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must collect at least the same chances as those who received before him , but this depends on the team for team@@ work in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to cook Mo@@ ors alongside Cook , which would bring an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four qu@@ icks , di@@ pped up and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a perc@@ ussions can &apos;t strike there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a v@@ icious sign of cri@@ cket @-@ player .
Mo@@ een maybe didn &apos;t do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is a number 3 for them , and there is no difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he achieved three hundred ra@@ gs at once and did not look back .
Z@@ afar accumulation comes in the ca@@ des as Back @-@ up @-@ Sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may look at their statistics - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 by the ball - and think it &apos;s a P@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spra@@ ying that elev@@ ates their hands and the trainer have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some smart ad@@ ditions at the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test plays could be a master coup .
he is one of the most kind@@ est not@@ ches of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming to the white ball @-@ stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition than players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices might have fresh winds in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously announced .
coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , but root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team record do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that , as with the players on their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made by easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit a Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit from Britain out of the EU ) might win at Zul@@ u if the economy is in a flu@@ ffy in 2017

foreigners also have their Cor@@ ren@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at , and recently said that some member states , so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Great Britain itself created an agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing all of the contrac@@ tual changes that they are not wish to be filled .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like this if they are threatened with social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photo of itself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that allies gain reforms for reforms .
it is always about me .
my European friend who wish to look out@@ war@@ dly in the Great Britain within the EU @-@ tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us know that more and more short @-@ cau@@ tious ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we will stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel is a ally , but she has been on power for 10 years before it looks bad for her as it looks bad for her as it did during the over@@ taking leng@@ th@@ ens such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a di@@ ap@@ preh@@ ensive force .
Poland possibly has a nation@@ alistic right government , Spain is left one left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will ri@@ p a bone to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be used to prevent their energy from the UK - something which they do not want , because most of them have separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies .
therefore , some such ministers don &apos;t plan to un@@ helpful comments , completely in SN@@ P style , during British Prime Minister in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how fra@@ ber@@ ically the Fle@@ et Street can be on their expense and what EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of press bar@@ ons as they did not have been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can recall Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who has made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
in all its tre@@ ach@@ ty Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley belonged to the steering wheel lam@@ entation , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers foreigners , and the p@@ seudo non @-@ incar@@ nation that possess most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about them , but pointed out that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa at a cage , you have better ban@@ anas than to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner .
indeed , the Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air itself , when he resi@@ sted Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s speakers , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the Constitution which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened its back@@ door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ bl@@ n , who gave me a friendly little rap@@ es@@ eed on Monday in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time for me to conf@@ use - seems to be repeated at risk , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take time but it must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ ren@@ ns official position to Europe is - I just put it out - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people out of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff trend and wild@@ ly vessels of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ lan@@ ism , everyone can say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ings &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on TV this week , &quot; did not admit that Cor@@ ren@@ ns had a dis@@ appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a pity on a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father was t@@ ted on television that he wanted to be with his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going to go far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all the circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell responded , nor what J@@ C told his comra@@ des and MPs after all reports on their retri@@ eval meetings on Monday night .
what I want to conv@@ ey the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ ren@@ n - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is right to give Cameron not a ticket to Europe which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours in the referendum campaign for a matter of self , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental differences in EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite @-@ tax @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is not merely a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric debate on the left dis@@ sidents , which is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its am@@ big@@ uous content to Nato - Tom Watson , fel@@ lows ensure that J@@ C will not start a campaign towards the ex@@ iting place - foreign diplom@@ ats will be committed to trying to find a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be po@@ int@@ less ?
the United States have been quite disappointed with the weak military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , in which I was remin@@ ded of something of what was called British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise the Public Health England &apos;s report on E @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , who responded to Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have posed the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data and presented to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
last month , an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ate basis &quot; based on which he justified his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researcher write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public opinion is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of re@@ trials and modeling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement made up of a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ search criteria ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to produce their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ related products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were presented in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose director had previously received from British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also instructed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants on the meeting explained that funds from a e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not funding he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which are also provided by sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco line from P@@ he took part in the meeting .
the research work of the group &quot; illustrated , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most of the products &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no such connections or limitations in the P@@ he report will be discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J has already been re@@ acted before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
each second life @-@ long smoking is his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are small , but that we continued to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to the public opinion about what the evidence is , and what does not , especially if it gives so much public confusion about the rel@@ ative risks compared to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die each year on a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system £ twice a year .
by clear showing of current evidence , e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but merely a fraction of the damage caused by smoking by smoking , we fulfil our national independence .
BBC should set up East En@@ ders , ex @-@ chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should end running programmes like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival had &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio service should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are broad@@ ly critici@@ zed by a smaller audience , which probably will probably be viewed from a smaller audience to the most popular shows of their rival and Sen@@ ads like BB@@ C4 .
after BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he has been trying for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on order or sends , which also clearly shown clearly from non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication Committee in the framework of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I hold medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least make its production , at least for programs that do not do any other or in order .
they send The Voice on a first @-@ class window , because they want to achieve a wide support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s natural nonsense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both original productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for this .
I stri@@ ve to see how this is to be public @-@ legally television .
I don &apos;t think this would l@@ essen the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for the series , launched in the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC will be hunting for reviews &quot; because of the ambition of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ en@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the more publicly @-@ judicial N@@ c programs &quot; may go to the BB@@ C4 , but they execute their tasks , and they can argue if they have created all those associated missions to justi@@ fication of $ 4 billion . &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these tracks that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window , in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value for this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of you think we all think that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who &apos;s a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to educ@@ ate , to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little from the BBC production would have been officially classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on radio - and they should change in the public broad@@ caster in Australia and Canada , for instance , to inform and enter@@ tain them . &quot;
on the question of the partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic engineering can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how these nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment it is ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems which can be controlled by hat@@ ch@@ ets of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are pun@@ is@@ cated with sound impul@@ ses who are responsible for the human hearing to high frequencies , to be ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the impul@@ ses work by the switch @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells which are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics to be used by ultr@@ asound in order to enable a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of stimul@@ ation stimul@@ ating electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of people suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease .
they do not react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani reported that they did so if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , then he found out , rein@@ force ultr@@ asound waves , who penet@@ rate the worms into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asound waves occur on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels , and found in the membran@@ es of some of the thro@@ po@@ cy@@ tes .
the sound waves have the opening of these ion channels and activ@@ ating the cells that they are assigned to a report of Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of its engine variant TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels wear .
when cutting ultr@@ asound on the changing creatures , the sound waves are intensi@@ fied by micro bubbles and transferred to worms , where they change the changed motor @-@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic engineering , a ground@@ breaking tool which enables scientists to set neur@@ ons with stimul@@ us of light and dis@@ able .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Gen@@ tics might have some advantages over this technology .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down on a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound shaft is un@@ hin@@ dered and can be absorbed into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily be able to make ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells .

eight golden rules for life in student dormitories
eleven years ago , I went as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and mor@@ als Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those that I made anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long@@ suffering complaints about others .
most of what I learned , can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residence halls ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ tively to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is entic@@ ing to ch@@ att@@ ing : people tell whence you come from where you are coming to Cor@@ ren@@ n , and why you have to say to Cor@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate it because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just an yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it gives you the conversation and helps you to find people out who they like in contrast to those with whom you wouldn &apos;t talk , even if your l@@ ashes were directed and these fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people work .
the rooms of people are often turning into beverage recipes , film @-@ night venues and public meeting points , but they are also the places where people are attrac@@ ting and counting on their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert a rough handling of the University .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room bal@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell to someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship more , but you must go away so I get the energy back I &apos;ve consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant is exhausted from Ges@@ el@@ iness - and send it an SMS instead .
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with che@@ eks .
as you start at the peak of the Back Man@@ ie , the l@@ apping is at the doors of people to imagine traveling with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I have some fried . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions .
to offer tasty home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
her ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain himself and become in the end perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , it depends on if you are a decent bak@@ ers .
po@@ or@@ ly , l@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat do not lead them sleeping , if you pull out .
to steal food , an essential crime in student dormitories .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it also taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea ?
check it out with the dairy owners .
chances are , they say to operate themselves , even when cooking in the interior .
if any man ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to push balanced for my ro@@ omm@@ ates , who added up her milk a pur@@ ge to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make noise , people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being an decent human being , but that you belong to people in the true meaning of that being in the glass .
a girl on my corridor asked its neighbors , whether they make them something quiet , Drum and Bass slightly qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they acted on it with even no@@ isy music .
when they finally heard around 5 o &apos;clock , they left their neighbors even two hours to sleep before they left their own music , shut down their door and went to their three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would enter into the same student residence ?
vice versa , it would not be pro@@ found@@ ly embarrass@@ ed if you have a co @-@ advoc@@ ate for your future couples who have to turn to them , and they will have to see each day and , perhaps , to see how they all come up with all their shared friends ?
of course , the heart is his own path - but when a hot ro@@ omm@@ ates is definitely not your future couples , please try at least to tell your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its keys in his non @-@ closed rooms , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ einer as it seems .
a good track is funny , but it takes just moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
deliver a valuable and am@@ using Less@@ on for security - but never def@@ rost the one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut up your door , and put their keys into a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not put their poss@@ essions to the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ stone , Ger@@ ing@@ Ear@@ th@@ ene
the property contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building the Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who have not much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room but also the only survi@@ ving mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ earn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to make it good and good at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushing onto the residential home market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes that how rapidly living space can be created : it builds inside a project of terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pushing for the residential home market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass housing in containers or containers has no sustainability .
for humans remain in a large part here .
given the refugee stro@@ ller , we also need enough space in the coming decades .
a whole , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a f@@ ew@@ ater needs the f@@ ew@@ est place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
that is different if one brings people into bar@@ blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted slightly to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
construction has taken six months .
this is reasonable .
do the regulations be complicated by their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I did not miss my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the placement operations .
cre@@ epy .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities are the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury homes for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but do you not tigh@@ tened the competitions for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the embassy , even the normal people need homes .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the less comp@@ acted .
I show how to make it good and good , even today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple is released
the new operating system can be challenged by choosing the configuration app , select &quot; General , &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are stum@@ bled upon problems , since they get an error message that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is mis@@ ro@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to wait either until the rush goes back or try to update over iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
that may mean the del@@ eting of apps , but Apple has probably made the delete of apps - but Apple has made it easier to do so if you use a special tool , to delete apps , and then re@@ install them when the process is completed .
it is worth knowing that your cell phone is charged during the up@@ dating or is located near a loading device so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will be continued , as the telephone may lead to half @-@ way routes , and this may lead to a crash of updates .

the victim was spra@@ yed onto the victim &apos;s th@@ igh and the victim &apos;s th@@ igh .
the injured one had to be hosp@@ itali@@ zed in a hospital .
so far , there is only a v@@ ague job description .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 metres in size and was clothed in a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and orders to report at number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes charge of practice and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is .
students are also delighted with the collabor@@ ator of Mr. Bernd Bor@@ mann , promoting economics in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places on the country , doctors are absent from the country . Dr. Frank Müller will take over his practice there on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel &apos;s rock is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich stands for his successor in the next few months with half a job .
after a re@@ building phase Müller opened the practice on 12 October , and he was investing 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy for the first sight , when the rock @-@ rise was met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at present passed their specialized training in the ild@@ ly hospital and also wants to get involved in practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ ash would be good in this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ Stand@@ ing and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I was ready , I just called them . &quot;
the idea was pleased to run the couple &apos;s couple in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old m@@ iller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families of the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss , soon .
and so we agree , the m@@ iller bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is a double family father Frank Müller also grew up there , followed in his medical practices in Hannover and followed in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ zel .
he is currently active as a senior veter@@ in@@ arian in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed a senior doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is volunte@@ ering at the DR@@ K @-@ read@@ iness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 , the practice was prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ut@@ ausen working as a resident specialist , his wife Ur@@ sel ( inter@@ lac@@ tin ) speci@@ alizes in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the m@@ iller , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle into health care .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy thus comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after conversion , the spaces will look even more modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound examination as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ inputs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely re@@ done .
a grant by 50000 euros will get the ri@@ llers as part of a funding programme by the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) .
&quot; that shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice continued , &quot; empha@@ sizes the collaboration champion Bernd Bor@@ mann .
approximately 2,000 patients are according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter in the field of practice , in the Northern Germany average practice they are about 500 .
there is another office practice in A@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of practices by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel &apos;s Fel@@ is in A@@ endorf .
if no successor has been found , it would have been gone .
those paid to the controller is still looking ahead , especially in confi@@ ded faces : taking the seven medical specialist and the cleaning power by the rock stand .
with their farewell we ended an era in As@@ endorf , at least the medical profession had been prac@@ tised for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; the original rock is ring@@ ing .
a little bit melanch@@ ol@@ y , after long time , feel after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inter@@ actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is compl@@ ying : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I &apos;ve always pushed me into garden work , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let refugees go through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls were driven out at our southern border , &quot; said Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel .
however , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask an asylum application must also be &quot; of course . &quot;
the security and safety of man stand in the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear , however , &quot; that there needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people need to know that we don &apos;t accept infinite migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had been informed that Slovenia had to continue travelling for refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany in order to conv@@ ene Kor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
however , the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not look like that .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; but Slovenia would rather lead the monitoring of the border - mainly to Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
the border with Croatia is already controlled as an outside yield of the Schengen area .
as the minister emphas@@ ised , Sloven@@ ians will with it for Refu@@ ge@@ es , but not abri@@ dged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government divided , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in the night hours on Tuesday to travel to the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to the border .
the Croatian police have been able to attack her in the near corn fields .
according to local media , we have ever meet police cars with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik Airport .
there were mainly Syrian and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
emergency services and the Red Cross are also in use .
over the coming days , his country with some 4000 refugees , interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
moreover , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo on the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which had previously carried to Hungarian border to the Hungarian border , agreed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied it that it would be individuals who contribute to certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor will we do this , &quot; it called .
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were the whole night of the more than 500 kilometres distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made it , so the police have told us that we are to go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
with this fact it could actually rise to a somewhat further west @-@ west route of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities to border check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country for the fall of a strong flow of refugees have prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations .
he did not tell details , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member have &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border check@@ ups . &quot;
one perform strict controls in order to qualify for the membership in the Schengen Area .
Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007 , the EU partners have since consistently followed a good testimony regarding the standard of the border controls .
on Serbian side just about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports the last night on the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , both border trips Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
if the remaining refugees continue to travel to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic was on Wednesday at a local point in Hor@@ gos still to calm : he considers the debates about altern@@ ativ@@ age of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be very high for refugee numbers .
one could not tell whether they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute tickets to the refugees in which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous , however , in parts of the border area there are still no longer mine@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine@@ field was sent to the border region .
bor@@ der@@ ers @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians have to pay 30 million dollars
Su@@ den@@ on@@ ok is supposed to have heard about a ring on cy@@ ber@@ crime that is accused of having gone an insight into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites like Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire .
the collected information should have been made by insi@@ der businesses on the financial markets .
according to this manner , more than 100 million dollars were awarded to the service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those of the Swiss borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in SEC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials of 32 further indic@@ t@@ aries continued in the case .
most of the accused were from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are planned to have both in the USA and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim exists for 20 years
around the Mann@@ heimer Par@@ ade@@ platz is prev@@ ailing .
the people are restra@@ ined , partly fast pac@@ es , partly cozy and lo@@ ung@@ ing .
they control the two stations of the Mann@@ heimer Autos@@ al@@ ons at Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep city tra@@ ms .
pul@@ s@@ ating , pr@@ all life with stunning autumn sun note and in the middle there are four big plates each with the heading &quot; Before me &quot; I want to die .... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical tro@@ di@@ remedy charged with this action on its 20th anniversary attentive and looks closely confron@@ ted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life , therefore we have walked in the midst of the midst of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ remedy supplies the pass@@ ers as well as questions and talks about the volunteers .
while some fit a password spontane@@ ously to chal@@ k , and set the sentence to &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; do not hesitate to stay with the camper by the USA , &quot; others stand shortly , &quot; say phr@@ ases like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
repeatedly , the mar@@ gins develop small discussions about the action , about life , how to deal with the die .
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I make sure that the end of this world comes up for me at some point , I can say responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic Work Mannheim , which is linked to the car@@ it@@ as@@ association of ec@@ umen@@ ical sus@@ pi@@ ds .
therefore this cat@@ chy action may be good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the tables , be understand@@ able , finally the act of a very personal matter .
the topic of death and dying is hair@@ y , as before with Tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hos@@ pi@@ z movement has helped a lot in recent years to open the people .
an assessment that is shared by Angel@@ ika Go@@ ett@@ ante .
the death and a tragedy is one of the volunteers during the first hour .
faced with personal involvement with the theme , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid requested by appeal , she immediately reported and was part of the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ ett@@ ante belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and family members in private households , hospitals , nursing and hosp@@ ice in Saint Vincent .
all are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ ett@@ ante can well deal with her job and experiences yet experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ n , I keep it precious and treasure for the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion of out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
financial support of health insurance companies and donations of families and associations , training , training , and super@@ visions of the mortality and funeral directors .
every two years , trainings for new employees are offered .
the signs described on Saturday are now in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes on postcards can also be noted there .
Fed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , reduced outlook for 2016
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the supply of the supply industry added a full year owing to the we@@ aker demand for freight services and higher costs in its transport security service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for holidays .
at this point in the last year Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell to 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading for 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a $ 10,@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in financial year , representing 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , average 4.9 percent and will be effective January 4th , and despite the higher amount of goods transport of heavy and large packages which will be collected from November .
the company said that it is still expecting the result compared to cost reduction , higher revenues , and growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company will spend a solid income if expected to be more efficient than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trading . &quot;
the plans for school employment have been announced a day later , when the rival UPS is scheduled to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , roughly the same number as last year .
in the third quarter , which ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million reported , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve from the A@@ acks Investment Research were predicted to predi@@ ct .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of C@@ acks were expecting an expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping for the past years , which resulted in sales in his unit Express disp@@ atch .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results from Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the final quarter sales were increased by 29 percent , but the operative result was basically flat for higher packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit decreased higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result was the result of higher labour costs .
in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares decreased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent of a record high on 11 June .
on her most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days a week , sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ ony @-@ table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade .
threatened above them at an end of the en@@ forcement , two @-@ storey seating sa@@ vers , there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ ise the US employment and prices to keep it stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an uns@@ aved third @-@ term mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to become acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the near @-@ term short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data from the economy show that it grows solid , the most recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets would strengthen the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representative to increase this vol@@ atility by interest in interest rate for federal bonds , and be only one quarter of per@@ cent@@ ages .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , CEO of management by Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , increased uncertainty is round the global market enough justi@@ fication , still waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed is going to do about the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raised the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists won the strike by promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ ages 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was raised by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ policy pursued the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she should go very far in her explanation to soo@@ the the financial markets , so that it is not in panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm down the financial markets , because they were uncertainty when the F@@ ed would take action .
even before a month , F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points to this month , the first small step in a slow deteri@@ oration of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ell@@ as had said in the spring and early summer , that in spite of the dis@@ miss@@ al of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase of the proposition was expected .
although the creation of job creation slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed considers full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the drop of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason may be the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , CEO at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media .
but the financial markets around the world comp@@ lied together at the end of the month after China had re@@ leg@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones industrial average value fell in May by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would imp@@ ose global growth .
the market has somewhat re@@ covering during this month and the Dow is now around 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representative influence , the market turbul@@ ences affect complex calculation when you should increase interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the events were not occurred on the financial markets and the messages about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US @-@ bank@@ note bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the health of the world economy is none of the main interests of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the less note of the then Director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could sell its monetary expansion &quot; tight , &quot; b@@ anded confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , they could not only monitor the developments at different locations , but also advis@@ ors with other central banks and experts , in order to obtain a better understanding for the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; he said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ actions on financial market movements , which apparently could not be linked to the economic fundament@@ ally data . &quot;
L@@ acker , a right member of the Federal Open Market Committee , sett@@ ling for a interest rate , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its motto by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable impacts on the growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives accounted for these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set out aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapsed , Adam S. P@@ osen MEP , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England .
the youngest turbul@@ ence arrive at this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to fall into the situation in which they fear of a interest rate because the markets turned out , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should take time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try to see LA@@ X @-@ C in Chinatown .
ja , Chinatown
the market / stock market was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai @-@ wholesale market , which is also sold to general public .
yeah , it is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town .
the market / stock is a central location and provides a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and christmas decorations .
there &apos;s even a car section , when you need motor oil .
the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the courses .
if the whole buying you make hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express .
the kitchen ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is near the box and has various sound @-@ taking options .
what is there : need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian speci@@ alities and regional Thai herbs , fruit , and more .
the meat bar is extensive , as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the bar will clean the fish and cook even on request for you .
a good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezer unit . here you find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ al , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef blood and g@@ all , pigs @-@ nat@@ u@@ ds , regional sausage , commercially prepared food and more .
you buy here : restaurant of restaurants and coo@@ ks , individual families and individuals .
the wide drives are suitable for trol@@ leys and for@@ kli@@ fts .
you can find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong D@@ uri@@ an beside the cas@@ hier .
where it &apos;s located : the shop is located in a industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
even if the shop is well attended , it &apos;s not hard to find a parking lot .
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
a warm welcome to them , does not go without the engagement of many volunteer workers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support independent asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them , Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher and soul teacher .
even with their 74 hand@@ le@@ bars she still teaches .
every Thursday it does the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger street .
it also helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan , to learn German language .
of course , it is different teaching than at a real school .
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy styles
the Brazilian pap@@ al organisation SP@@ RS tried to clari@@ fy women in a sho@@ cking way to investigate how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that should be performed for mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet may actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the Bern@@ ried fleet approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euros building gym .
and he made one exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ desired gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Centre comes step forward by step forward : in recent community administration , the revised building application was approved without major discussions .
previously , the panel had previously approved a request to the newly @-@ legal &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; Liberation &quot; of the valid development plan .
for the &quot; exception &quot; we went to permit a special form in the roof construction .
consequently , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ed first and roof@@ top &quot; should be erected .
background of planning is the fore@@ seen use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; thus we get a wonderfully big South East together , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof @-@ ten@@ ant that is expected for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is clearly reduced .
a &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan regarding the pit@@ falls no &quot; exceptions &quot; - although the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council usually per@@ ishes restric@@ tive with exemp@@ tion contracts , more restric@@ tive .
in this case , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .

Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should now be closed as planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to P@@ ong@@ au .
this sees the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH , which was confirmed by the Land@@ ro@@ tin , Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white .
however , the supervisory board meeting this decision , and the next Wednesday , September 23 .
the plans should be implemented then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue .
the overwhelming majority should be f@@ anning with fishermen and the next existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who can not go to Ch@@ ong@@ au in W@@ eil@@ heim can be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of their plans .
the change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and is now changed to a private practice in immediate vicinity of the hospital .
when asked who to enter the succession , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; fishermen &quot; came to the game , who was willing to take on the line on 1 October and altern@@ ate with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of 1 October .
for the home in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means in any case a dev@@ al@@ uation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibrill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the internal station for gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years Fischer with his team , if the board of Supervisory Board shall agree to both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ies , which has not yet been appointed for 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
so far , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation was completed by the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government in the future , shall be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I close this . &quot; as it goes on to the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß did not say there are several consider@@ ations .
there are currently a short @-@ time nursing care of Car@@ itas and an Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better things could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi Mov@@ ing to the Le@@ ch , who has been received by employees &quot; positively and very understand@@ ably . &quot;
it has not been given a real perspective for the house where fishermen are working for more than 30 years .
he has been asked of Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues , to take the position of medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , sections were closed , for example , surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
tonight ( at 8.@@ 15 pm ) the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neckar lions are required at the Berg@@ ische HC .

refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing
the situation on the German residential home market is stra@@ ined .
even more refugees seek a paid stay .
the pressure on the residential home market is growing .
the social housing situation is faced with a challenge .
the distribution partners in the German housing market have long since begun .
more people are pushing for the coming refugees and working @-@ seek@@ ers from the EU to a market that is now over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with income minds to their last affordable housing .
in order to cover demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
the result is a study on behalf of the association &apos;s term &quot; social housing . &quot;
for comparison , there are 26@@ 0,000 units in Germany this year .
thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a preliminary accommodation .
many places in the residential home market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to statistics of Statistics in the last year , however , less than half of all the asylum seek@@ ers came to rent .
however , the negative development of the residential market is not only rising to the rising refugee numbers .
the study also makes considerable upset in the housing policies of recent years .
Germany Schi@@ eves a residential deficit present from year to year becomes greater .
currently , Matthias Günther is currently missing in the Ball@@ room areas , where Matthias Günther is accused of the study .
many people , therefore , stayed in large cities and listed in flat share rooms .
young adults remained un@@ willing for their homes in the housing market for a longer time in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per capita has declined for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ en@@ tives are to boost the social housing estate again .
this may be wai@@ ved on the property tax , and the property tax on funded housing will be reduced .
according to the alliance , according to the alliance needs attractive contro@@ ll@@ ability possible .
the grants programme of State Bank Kf@@ W grants now well for cities and municipalities already well .
a good week after the start , the production was € 184 million , with 184 million euros more than half of the € 300 million available on Monday evening .
now the project could even be increased .
the refugees have a free entrance : Croatia and Slovenia have a corridor
Hungary is practically no passing from Hungary . there are more refugees to choose between Croatia and more .
Zagreb announces that the journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les to be granted .
but the route nonetheless is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Home Secretary Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to go to Western Europe from there .
500 people have arrived on the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV RTL reported .
Hungary had sealed its limit for refugees right on the day before .
new laws , which occurred on the same day in force , make it virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to allow refugees to happen .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and do something .
however , there are people who do not want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police arrested the first refugees at the Serbian border in Croatia at the border of Serbia on the morning .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and taxi in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival , they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serb fron@@ tier the refugees meet not in Gren@@ ache .
this coinci@@ des the border of the border with other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine@@ field must now create a safe passage .
after Hungary , after the closure of the border , little more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before Tor@@ ve on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws have the over@@ coming and damage of the border with us as a criminal off@@ ence .
therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the sentences handed down sentences from up to five years and the deportation out of the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration authority , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers have been opposed to the newly established &quot; Tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; in total , almost all of them - 93 - on the major transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two older people are involved .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees had still left .
practically no one has granted asylum in Hungary . practically , however , he has granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe country country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
before the &quot; Tran@@ se@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only few hundred refugees were gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to plu@@ ck up workers .
they collected the garbage collection , leaving tens of thousands of people in the road@@ side in recent weeks .
pl@@ ywood was destroyed and one of the recording camp in the border was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express this change .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
in addition , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
but around the 20,000 displaced persons , however , they continued in the country .
in Salzburg , some 1400 people are waiting for the continuing trip to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped on the morning at the order of German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing regular groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor drove through the border &quot; through the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy on Sunday with the departure hall , when suddenly ten people with rice supply at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ ers Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
because Germany had surprisingly supp@@ ressed the rail transport with Austria on Sunday , but for her help at W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who offered immediately his help and ran the stran@@ ded together with two other helicop@@ ters and their cars over the border to Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we made the un@@ hop@@ eful guests only once sti@@ lled , with snack and drinks .
we said at the same time , we bring them into Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as a city council in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stran@@ ded train passages were switched on Sunday night in W@@ els from a train to regional train in direction to Pass@@ au , but after the short notice was the announcement that the railway traffic was stopped after Germany , but still attempts to try the border .
but the regional train was put off at the inn in W@@ ern@@ stein along the inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge association with the Bavarian neighbours is soci@@ able on Sunday , days earlier a double @-@ bridge racing - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending us other Z@@ ig@@ nia to us , is a logical result of an apparent policy :
rather than in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp , in order to help build trust in the construction of structures , our ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or has formally established the attitude of the Hungarian authorities in the dun@@ geon of Naz@@ ism .
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ geous of these policies are not only those Austrian who are confron@@ ted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the poultry have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be a great challenge , given the continuing refugee flow and the approaching winter to make decent states for conservation .
and it will be even bigger to maintain its peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,000 women &apos;s Qu@@ arti@@ s
Konrad has fully recovered all his hands together .
Christian Konrad is it normal that his word weight has weight .
the government has deployed the earlier , Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers , in order to exp@@ ose qu@@ arti@@ s for thousands of refugees .
chaos in the first admission center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already received a grip .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees came on Monday to Austria on Monday , Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ fully &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ liable situation . &quot;
Konrad with a need of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ s in the he@@ uris@@ tic year .
to carry out the number , 35,000 accommodation must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to deliver the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he already has conversations with the state capit@@ alists .
these would have been granted to him to create Qu@@ arti@@ s for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it &apos;s going well , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied how the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator uses the right of asylum to the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help as We &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation on the platform .
in addition , you would be hoping for the most of the hotels in winter .
finally , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that o@@ arti@@ sti@@ tis have to hold a certain amount of hand@@ tu@@ ch@@ holder or size of lift .
for short @-@ term time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would apply .
contrary to the Ministry of the Interior when it is a successful person , Konrad is a leader with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , whom they do not say without further into the vision .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause any cost as they declared themselves .
their number of employees wants to increase them to three to four .
the private investig@@ ational search has not yet been successful .
Konrad was trying to put a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for better distribution
there is no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary , as one can currently under@@ go the affected people without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) says .
however , for emergency , further locations on their suit@@ ability are to be insp@@ ected .
cri@@ tique of the Municip@@ ality of Refu@@ ge@@ es within the Federal District .
other areas must also contribute to their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) issued a further procedure in refugee demand on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
again , the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is the corresponding border controls .
special trains with refugees in Germany won &apos;t be there any more .
however , the seeking seek@@ ers would be brought with regular trains to Germany .
for the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger called for once more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that now also Austria leads to its borders again checks , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the proceedings of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Shi@@ pyard &quot; at the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially closed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the stock exchange IT Group S &amp; T is mig@@ rated , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T chef Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies in the New shi@@ pyard , and later he could continue to acqu@@ it .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T will cooperate with the new neighbors , which means that Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Federal State ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is designed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ dial .
30 percent of the 2700 square metres of resi@@ ding in the building are already let . for another 40 percent , there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ su@@ ant opened second business in the Arctic
at the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are central .
actually J@@ utta Hot@@ it wanted to put a dog .
this project had to shift the 49 @-@ year @-@ old national owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , it has now got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop , opposite the store , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of different manufacturers are now all about ladies hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la brand , wall@@ ets are starting at 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
since yesterday the new shop is operating .
it had been rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I didn &apos;t wait long if I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers , which are at home in Bologna , was the idea of a site of a site where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the big room in Linz , which this brand sell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters that has roots in Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your fashion interest has given Bre@@ it from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I share the most , if something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why such a woman can answer in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the final woman cannot answer to the final safety .
maybe it is about getting a nice bag of any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter in K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called An@@ ders .
this property also combines some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses itself in a foreign hos@@ tile , journalists or g@@ aps in regards to international crisis policy - candidates for the US presidential policy are acc@@ entu@@ ating the election campaign .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the whi@@ st@@ ling K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate of billi@@ ard come from .
the New Yorker , with the con@@ ciliation , is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf near the wine road .
man@@ holes in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ atine : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers look like to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that will somehow be exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter manner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jumps on which besides Tr@@ ump belongs to the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) also in word - so with this statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king &apos;s heart .
while resp@@ ect@@ ful respect to the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big la@@ zy &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the k@@ all@@ stadt within a circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - goes to High German : the performer , says it .
so , tr@@ ump comes from the village of the leg@@ islat@@ ure .
the tr@@ ump &apos; success story began 1885 , when the late grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a local for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the property of the property company had first piece of plot in New York .
but life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : your wish to return to homeland in time , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pfalz were back then .
he was not admitted that he was admitted once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pa@@ der@@ el@@ ic History and People &apos;s findings , Roland Paul , had declared a movie star@@ tup .
may be the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal out@@ mig@@ rations . &quot;
this is in contrast to the midnight statements of the desc@@ endant .
he had repeatedly spoken of over Mexican immigrants in the USA and required the construction of a boundary to avoid illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ishes , it is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , an removed TR@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a new@@ born ho@@ ump who was &quot; born &quot; ) .
the wine @-@ v@@ int@@ ner in retired sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he &apos;s always three thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump arrives ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pend@@ ra@@ cian Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters reveal that a visit to the church , Heinz , came to an end for the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she explains it better if he won &apos;t get the choice , because &quot; he has such a radical change , I do not know if this is good . &quot;
if they , who had the legends of his grandfather in the United States , would have been like he , &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ken Sarah Bü@@ hler .
and as President ?
&quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ el &apos;s film , interviewed for the tr@@ ump long , have seen 12 000 young cat@@ chers , also in the USA awak@@ ens the interest .

in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ eering . &quot;
the local Alpine Association is responsible for the awar@@ ding of the award .

the breakfast show from Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , as Malcolm Gymn@@ as@@ it managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the hosts of David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ard , was present in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this down@@ side of the insur@@ rection appeared to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise had an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , in comparison to today &apos;s 33@@ ,000 .
today , Today achieved a slight increase in comparison to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) .
today , Today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed during the last months .
in August Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 from sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between € 40,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September , Sun@@ rise has at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning more than the parliament !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of series to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
the new drama of a recently fallen father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
revealed a secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay , and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might seem un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , finally , at Sam Wood , finally landed in The Bachelor , has been in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left @-@ left girls will certainly not give as though it is the person who received the last rose .
but when we , together with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on Day , before they are three , you possibly acci@@ dentally put an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have gone out on ly@@ rical manner why Wood is the perfect man and called its sense for humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who was Woods to last li@@ ly ? &quot; could their answers to the game , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both fast - besides himself - Mack@@ ay &apos;s best partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a long relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were rather compatible , and I thought that was quite compatible with the whole performance , &quot; Je@@ av@@ on &apos;s Fel@@ lows .
Sarah stands at both feet on Earth , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I &apos;ve seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are perfectly suited as a couple .
from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the first week of the house made her clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and my family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not they , there she was r@@ attle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the left @-@ loving girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is on Wednesday at 7 : 30 PM on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle also showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams sent by requests following his impressive end of training at the end of last year .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens once , one takes care of only the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after police mig@@ rate to prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after the police g@@ utter in a crowd pressed against the proposed new constitution , an officer said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Managing Director , said that over 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station where some of you threw the stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police have deployed Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and shot into the air before moving to rub@@ bing .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the g@@ utter shelter , known of them , is known that they can indeed kill , but traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , obviously a high death rate produced .
the conflict was the last in weeks violent protest in Nep@@ alese southern levels where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ass@@ i say that new provinces , which will be formed under the proposed new constitution , would decrease its political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal of the Th@@ arus &quot; ethnic group that want to create their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were confron@@ ted by violent cl@@ ashes since the 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal has been gover@@ ned for centuries .

Google starts the dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ giving campaign to raise the $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees that over@@ threw the European nations , as they flee from war torn and pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach at the announcement of donations in his blog .
rather than leaving a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant , who had fled with her family from Kabul , she was seven years old and her personal experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our trip there were many dark train and bus rides , just hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants &apos; crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations who provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations raised up to € 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / s will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .

coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for slightly exagger@@ ated diabe@@ tics may be useful to loss @-@ loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial in the new study in j@@ ama surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surg@@ eries or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own capacity to absorb food .
obesity treatment for the treatment of type 2 diabetes was proven efficiently over the years , but most studies have been carried out in humans that are disease @-@ ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ surgery - Mag@@ ical ypass and gast@@ ric hoses - for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI among those who underwent surgery , decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
consequently , the BMI in those who do not surgical diabetes treatments were equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % of diabetes cases were completely dissolved , and at least 28 % of diabetes .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes is complete only in one percent and partly at only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; in general , better in the &apos; surgical group &apos; .
the researchers also supervised the patient @-@ blood sugar level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflect in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , thus the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also con@@ vol@@ ved the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery Group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher returns in BMI ( 3.1 % vs 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence of a study in Sweden that operation goes to a longer life , says Black@@ stone by the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who underwent a Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that there was a cal@@ ming thing for persons interested with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this low BMI group , without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is with BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they have collected this genetic changes , associated with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not include all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called on to stop violence in the indigenous people of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised to deal with the problems of the refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in the UK in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which devoted eth@@ ics studies .
he requested that , under the circumstances of humanity , he requested that the interests of humanity should be set before the interests of some nations or even continents .
he also empha@@ sized that the West European countries response to the refugee crisis of the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama has engaged in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but meanwhile you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we have to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence never has resolved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised to the problem of violence , commenting also George Bush &apos;s actions after the September 11 terrorist attack , revealed that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences to President Bush &apos;s letter , and I told him , the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his moti@@ ves were good , but he put strength in authority , and that brought forth unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of taking @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low a strong alcoholic tran@@ des@@ infection , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lopez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of disinf@@ ect@@ ants attended children under 12 years of reporting the toxic@@ ity centres will report about 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly often coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in listing , &quot; said Lopez CNN .
he said that some children have disinf@@ ect@@ ant care while some do it to im@@ press her friends or because of a mut@@ t at social media .
video on YouTube shows how to drink hot disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash@@ es to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lopez .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are saving .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes and orange du@@ es that are very pleasing for children .
hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very young children can lead a few syr@@ inge on alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the call centre at the University of Kansas , the Station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not have a si@@ p whis@@ key , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from the strawberry pul@@ mon@@ des@@ infection agent in the school was brought into a emergency treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold of law in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a staff doctor , who treated them at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed their words and wasn &apos;t able to go when she arrived in the listing .
doctors overs@@ aw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had kicked his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ tic &apos;s mother , CNN .
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lopez has the parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ est@@ ations and to store hanging disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
on alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .

the lack of title competition in the Scottish football bo@@ red Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that the Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic people , as there is no title of ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see those games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eila .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila acknowledged that Celtic people must fight , but the Norwegian head reson@@ ates to turn things around .

&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eila said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had had a bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly so - but we have to go on .
we really need to really , really the support of Celtic people because it makes players better .
now it is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful in January transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre@@ season time to integrate , what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage will be caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it rises in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained in the period from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without jobs for the United Kingdom stood as a whole in the same period about 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
the unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was beyond the NSC 631570 level of 5.5 per cent , as the number of offices for National Statistics ( for dating only ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 of the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent during the quarter - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .

why I become witness to an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except for a late registration , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the ob@@ session in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the injec@@ tions .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first mentioned in January of his best friend and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day went closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications to be available , a mac@@ ab@@ aster lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
anyone who will be selected is to be emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ony and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh when we speak .
the jail authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to record a notebook &amp; pen , to record what I see .
I have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ partial manner .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants to , and you receive access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better shape &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he does not tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter , to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations work will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Podcasts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back here again all details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ esis would commit him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ant of deeds .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no sufficient evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters , where you can apply for this .
what you can get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .

the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale police was launched on Tuesday to a home strike accident in Beck@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , this tried to escape along the Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I come not out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ ying on him and threat@@ ens to end racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy alle@@ ys that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables and threatened to end the race immediately .
he cited the ste@@ wards and the Integ@@ rity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race @-@ day treatment , the last straw hal@@ ted on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it went to the positive cob@@ alt sample at Li@@ dar@@ i that he could not explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of sp@@ ying the es@@ pion@@ age and did not want it to &quot; see how much hung &quot; grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say anything about it , and I have long sat on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that anything is coming suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know there was going on .
sometimes , you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live with them what I said .
I will go home today and sleep well .
I want to walk around walking , and I want my owner to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I must consider what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy accepted the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ism , that the integrity @-@ section had tried to sp@@ ying his barn .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart said in a room with a man - whom I will ren@@ ame when I am asked - and put on him a job in my st@@ ables , to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they certainly may contain themselves of their n@@ oses , because it is trying to hold me failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ die , Route 16@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were well aware of that today and are still today .
should I bring this to my mind that it will be personal ?
Route L has cra@@ cked up and are doing people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
are I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think out there , I &apos;m there .
you may have to take away my license and spur@@ ned me away , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it now .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the spring levels of the train@@ ers have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt @-@ test at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching had led to it that he could &quot; t@@ oss his license above the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ coated master &apos;s Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment instructions &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse plane , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take over responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff lost mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have happened yesterday evening .
it would have been so yesterday all day so that it was so .
but it also was so on the race @-@ day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the racing day . an inquiry into this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people , who establish these rules , do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here &apos;s too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats against ri@@ vals for claims to ring mar@@ ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling his player as &quot; agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites for the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster &apos;s Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said the refer@@ ee of the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring combat &quot; with his team during the high @-@ qualifying finals in Sydney finals will have allowed Friday night in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett did a huge note on the Storm Team , after his team had scored the Final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game &quot; Mu@@ g@@ og@@ ame &quot; by ru@@ g@@ by League , and said that the two from Queensland are not &quot; too good &quot; at the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ends the kn@@ uck@@ le of his crew and said that she is only concent@@ rating on her &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coach did in his team agree on it as it noted that she was worried about to become involved in the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always shows up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson heard about Ring@@ thers , when she listened to us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ ensive System or the techniques throughout the year . but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics to a real focus , and this has provided a turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to keep playing . he &apos;s probably not to get used to it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is strange that it emerg@@ es as usual at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy came to the idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds us that Benn@@ i St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons played the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George became a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a shit about her .
but now he has a team that can play and which we look as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as these .
I build stronger trust because they are saying these things , because they are a little concerned to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm versus Roo@@ ster recorded a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos probably was a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are there breaks and there are no cl@@ amping points ?
for me , it is the sched@@ ules .
when they mention , it means that in a phase we will meet them .
the Storm @-@ Team free at this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start next Tuesday starting tomorrow .
glass bier with $ 200,000 Guaranteed after drug cl@@ en@@ age
a man , perhaps a li@@ fel@@ ong punishment was threatened because of his trial in the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which had been s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Queensland , was released against a b@@ ail of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug at the yacht Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America on V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly viable sentence for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the Justice on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of fluid at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he told the court on Wednesday .
in the case of the criminal case , the police have lied about his position .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the sworn aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be sufficient to avoid it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serbian passport , while the police gets on a daily cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

this also reflected on the IAA ( Audi@@ ence days 17 to 27 September ) .
in this year , many new compact models were presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the greatest pre@@ m@@ owers for the German motor@@ ran@@ ds is the Opel Astra , who will be tra@@ ced by dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann said at the fair .
he belongs to the brand &apos;s core .
the volume model also has to be sold well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel offers an entry below the largest competition in the VW Golf , which starts at 17@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra is from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ esse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , with the first three @-@ cylinder gasoline engine .
unlike the major competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra boasts the Opel Astra only five @-@ five models .
a second version will follow in the spring of Kom@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA ( International Motor Show ) .
and what will be available next to the Astra at the IAA in Frankfurt ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra Galaxy in the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e will exclusively be seen in a conventional and st@@ resses spor@@ tive GT version .
in the shops , he comes to the beginning of next year , then as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan spin @-@ off wants to find his position in the strong @-@ growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti fits with its curved lines in the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer , a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is its world premiere in Frankfurt .

the maximum torque of torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in the spring of 2016 .
DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed , the compact car model DS 4 is completely renewed .
in the outside , the Citroën , Citroën and Citroën presented hands on the front partial : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and mounted the head@@ lights with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , reduced the number of buttons by touch@@ screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ ry for the first time .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are a series of over@@ working and new variants such as the emerging Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a former in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel , which was accommod@@ ated for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners have to be entitled to financial compensation when they are in small cells .
this decision was taken by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected may even hope for judges , if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . he was accommod@@ ated in the Federal Ministry of Justice in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 , with a unit of approximately five square metres ; the toilet is spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who had now found himself on the free cell , had been transferred to a larger cell again .
his mandate expired because of the detention conditions of detention against the land of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Court judges the ruling of the Berlin Chamber of the Chamber and rejected the case for the re @-@ trial .
you see the man &apos;s dignity .
Chamber @-@ chamber decides about the amount of the compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for the compensation were decisive , there was given a compensation for compensation .
otherwise it would be &quot; a wi@@ mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber of chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the judges in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
thus they said to be a det@@ ain@@ ee in April , because he was imprisoned naked in a prison cell .
human un@@ worthy is also a decision from 2011 even the multi @-@ assignment of a cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel event in November 2009 , confirmed a decent housing that was agreed by a det@@ ain@@ ee in November 2009 .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took place over three months , from 15 to 21 hours in an equivalent cell as in Karlsruhe &apos;s dor@@ man@@ or case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been hit the headlines in recent weeks due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always enclosed in 23 hours , which clim@@ bs aggres@@ si@@ veness , to be able to fight it because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Department of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to offspring of up to 19 .
Angela Merkel and the Refu@@ ge@@ es policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the forecasts of the German Ministry of Agriculture , following the statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrates in the face of the unusual challenge to demonstrate : &quot; I say again and again , we can do this and we can do it . &quot;
the following overview is convey@@ ed when it comes to Germany .
used according to different forecasts up to 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the federal ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments a year - and for the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatically , but above all in affordable properties : 60 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments are out of the rental cost , and in order to apply these extra affordable housing , refugees also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is the point of view from the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social apartments have to arise each year and therefore the federal government would have to invest EUR 6,4 billion a year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , scientists and federal minist@@ ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investing in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research , 55 per cent of the poultry are employed in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany would not ever been systematically questioned about their qualification in order to help them , and Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation .
for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission analysis , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ enti@@ hardt .
according to th@@ ron@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around according to the throne : from labor to recognition for refugees .
while there was an employment ban on asylum seek@@ ers by up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers to a residential resort .
in society itself - also because of the lack of skilled workers - mostly due to the lack of view that refugees to the labor market should be made faster .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labor market are missing German .
so far , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
therefore , the set @-@ up of networks is according to the Throne of the Royal Path to Labour integration .
the Berlin school administration has established that only few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ eline , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oted parents , it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ evi@@ ch , spokesperson for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family from the benefits of the Kit@@ a , management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need of educ@@ ators have strongly increased by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate is trying to increase the training capacity , by offering more technical colleges .
in the countries , students are prepared with non @-@ German language courses in welcome classes .
they are not always taught by skilled teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ amps of the Berlin school administration .
the German student organisation estimates that roughly 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
in principle , there is no federal asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ali@@ ens the study - the only exception was Berlin , interior architect , handle ( CDU ) has now abandoned his position .
studio @-@ content refugees could be reli@@ eved of their university access .
for refugees with a resident condition or Dul@@ ce does not get any services under the asylum seek@@ er law if they start studying .
the latter does not get B@@ FS as they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ allow@@ ances .
Ged@@ ul@@ ted refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany so far to be eligible for B@@ Af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months from 1 January 2016 onwards .
but this funding gap must also be concluded , Steffen Kra@@ k , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student union .
the students should immediately get B@@ FS .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is more important part of their identity .
the state should gradually consent to Islam as the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ religions ratio .
it would be important to the foundation of an Islamic welfare Association who profession@@ ally care for new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also obligations .
thus , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear contact persons and be willing to collabor@@ ate with the state in many sectors and to plu@@ ck up certain control possibilities .
the read@@ iness to take heed to religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism belong to this .
the Chairman of the Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed the concern of religious conflicts could also be registered to Germany on Thursday .
those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the basic law of Arabic .
integration will continue to be a lot more today than today a matter of society .
this will also change its majority society , the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism is becoming more urgent .
indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination policy since a decade and a law of gender equality law .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NSU @-@ murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the stakeholders are for a long time , and for what international agreement is to commit to an anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany , must remain true in the next few years if the country will remain peac@@ efully and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to medi@@ tate medical care for so far , the President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery meant so far .
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we create that , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money must be flowing into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery needs to be identified , regardless of all the trav@@ ellers , at registration of health cards .
later , benefits could be accounted for by federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people are prof@@ essed with the limited power catalog to see the asylum seek@@ er law .
otherwise the doctors do primarily make the language barriers .
as far as previously , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved , of course , migrants are well known about their diseases and other patients .
nor only in clinics , including medical practices , interpre@@ ting charges are required , they are required .
many refugees , however , could also already be used with more gener@@ alized medical response in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic ga@@ ze .
among refugee children , there are much more un@@ dealt with disabilities , and with the young people go to an HIV @-@ education .
but with the other aspects of disease , German doctors came from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery meant .
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and as for the medical pleasure , due to the refugees , either relief is possibly even in sight .
the Syrians would have been a highly developed education system . several refugees are even doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would have to prove their quali@@ fications and possibly dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate again .
at least half of the refugees arrive in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Federal Patent Court ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psychological disorders : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress injury or under depression .
particularly vulnerable to refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by TU Munich demonstrated that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who have been suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , amongst others , suffers the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart valves , and ath@@ es .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong terror and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have been received .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy , however the processing takes mostly several months .
in addition , social workers or doctors , who are not trained in the social conditions , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to false ass@@ essments , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus is disc@@ ord on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the aim is to draw every age group in the spell of intri@@ gu@@ ing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and al@@ lied entertainment .
now the Circus is inviting you to dream in the ring on the bricks .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - the slogan is shown by this motto .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst in more than 33 years .
so the gift for the delight is in the blood .
&quot; it is important to take people away from their everyday life and take them to an entirely different world for two hours , st@@ resses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior level .
&quot; property cocktail with world city fl@@ air , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst will be his concept .
this fl@@ air can now experience 50 cities on the barely 3 &apos; 000 kilometer tour .
the Circus &apos;s programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with a joke and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also know their craft .
with the heroes of the dum@@ mies , the Cuban duo wants to come loose .
light@@ ness and flexibility - identify themselves with these words .
their humor@@ ous art at the mast is to capture female companions in the storm .
besides a number of salmon fat@@ alities the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also with finger@@ tip and destruction .
to balance with the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sn@@ app@@ ing and sc@@ are at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 staff from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes St. Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject for various animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes position : &quot; is it not good for our animals , is it not good for us too . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoyed a string box .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ cho@@ irs , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read by the possibility of every wish .
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
does not feel comfortable , it also wants to get into the ring .
so the su@@ preme commandment is : good for the animals .
specially on her Zeb@@ ras Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ horse and a zeb@@ ra , the family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a fence , and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the Zeb@@ roid is still not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there will be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 20 a.m. to its performances .
on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 pm .
Thursday is the first day , for the introduction at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , the animal @-@ show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe delivers false speech in the parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of a podium .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread rapidly throughout the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening ceremony was also clou@@ ded by the claims of members of the opposition that they had been warned of anonymous threats and warned them against Mr Mu@@ gabe Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month , they had b@@ lown him out , and interrupted him in his speech in the State of Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions politician SMS messages have received their cell phones that they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told repor@@ ters of Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of Parliament warns that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , its parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
the speakers said that , by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard becomes up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard becomes more than 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and saving efforts to consoli@@ date the company &apos;s services .
hp will divide up later this year in two publicly tra@@ ded companies offering computer and printer business from its rapid @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job loss leads to a load of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , saying HP in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will focus smaller and more focused than the HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that are holding the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and will be focused on deployment , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , and has also called the &quot; birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
hp has a massive restructuring process to tackle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC producer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on belief that strongly focused companies bringing a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand before the play against Dynam@@ o Zagreb in front of the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and so far as its rehabilitation will go according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England . in view of its history , its participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain at the European Championship .
the great dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had stopped the last season after a separate Kn@@ uck@@ le injury , and then returned to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it is a bone , which was not good .
this is no greater thing .
this was only an accident .
it was not in contact with his Kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries which he had before .
this may be true from purely medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger accepted , there is the related danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a pleasant pattern .
the findings of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different areas of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ i@@ als 157 Lig@@ as@@ play in the last five days .
the bro@@ ader picture of Arsenal is that they have been in six of eight playing time since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepted the potential of a devil circle , but arsen@@ al believes that improvement in the amount of injuries will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win mar@@ tial force , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal begins his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of playing Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta had to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to indul@@ ge a little break &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the arsen@@ al favor@@ ites are to continue with Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the fields with the greatest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday night through an earthquake which was measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has pulled the doctrine from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , driven by far hope to lead the club to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
for arsen@@ al , it never worked .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship : the comedy show that will give us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar patterns in shows is obvious , especially in regard to how the need for men to open , now is desper@@ ate than ever , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high look .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men ranging from 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains in men for three times more likely in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign against Living Mis@@ er@@ el ( CA@@ LM ) Campaign against a her@@ edi@@ tary life in 2015 , called for the year of a man with the goal of asking the culture in question if they need to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms determined that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; its chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of emotion@@ ally healthy friends involves the risks of mental problems .
but of course , one must first have friends , so that it may work for friendship .
in the age of about social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , fun and successful , doubles , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists define ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , everything at costs in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire explained recently , money can &apos;t really buy money .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was turned on my head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality defined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler @-@ frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football gu@@ zzle in cozy sh@@ ackl@@ es and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case even if they often return to explore fully their feelings .
as a staff of telephone call I declared to me : ... &quot; my listen@@ er role for people who are de@@ pressed and confident they are really clearly shown how the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel not able to speak with friends .
the old phr@@ ases &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you speak about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows which comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ term irrig@@ ation mechanisms .
it show@@ cases very clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ si@@ der status on the phone the people in eyes of despair can help but the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , when you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fes@@ tivity with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you pick your friends to a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give it a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference might make your friendship .
friends will be sent at Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the complete 236 episode - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets with PS@@ G to dis@@ gr@@ ate Malmö .
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh , following his hits against Malmö .
in his debut in the Champions League , together with his debut in the Champions League , PS@@ G helps to move to Malmö .
here are the games report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh will be held as Paris Saint @-@ Germain to win his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Malmö in the Prince &apos;s Park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria arrived less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ but@@ s as PS@@ G players who carried the French Master on their way , but subsequently they missed a series of opportunities before they finally increased their lead than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
together with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris will need a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they are not only seeking quali@@ fications for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but a improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ alists in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class name from Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics missed chances in front of the gate . he later became in play against his home town team and against the club , with whom he started his har@@ k@@ ens career already in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ stream in the Champions League , so it is a good start to back up 2 : 0 , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Blanc said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it , that we haven &apos;t had one or two more goals . &quot;
Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but was dischar@@ ged by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian fl@@ atter@@ ing man was called to take the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over in Manchester United last month , and he interpreted to why when he entered in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense , before he finished Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would have a great victory that was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off proposed to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and had a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but except one shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they were little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G gave himself up sometimes , with some mis@@ chi@@ pping and bad de@@ tions , not least because of merely five attempts in the first half was patented and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a much more skill , when he brought his players into the game , and it was a Pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , turning the Di Maria into a shooting down which was sunk by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the test ...
the second gate finally fell short after the morning @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er made his sixth end in the season , after reaching str@@ mo@@ vic had f@@ aked a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts that Malmö had come into the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could stop the end result before the substitute of Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi identified a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian author said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League who did not have the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

the FC Bayern was obviously few years ago in front of the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for FC Barcelona .

Brown re@@ acted shocked , insul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . &quot; okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian confirmed .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the company Ben @-@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ ol@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to think people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to deal with the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown initially said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

women &apos;s comments come at a time when exact r@@ att@@ ain@@ sy represents the media at the fore@@ front of the social discussion .
after teenage Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves movement in nationwide seized physical practices and repression , discrimin@@ atory practices against color content .
in February , the singer Prince made an announcement to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards .

during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ er@@ aman F@@ off B@@ ritten , to the finals .
the last task was to climb the rock climbing on a 75 feet long climb rope in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended the task within the period , where@@ with he was the first athl@@ ete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of the American Ninja war@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero did not finish this challenge for a three seconds behind him .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed set himself with The Hollywood Rep@@ orters to discuss the final and why B@@ ritten , although he finished the course at all , not just any prize money .
after the rules the money is due to the fastest person .
&quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alists , the one receives with the quick@@ est time , &quot; he said .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he gets the great gra@@ ti@@ fication .

he is just so lucky to have done what he did .
he received awards from awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt just when they were disper@@ sing the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a third season , fil@@ ming will start in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers gr@@ ind on Minnesota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ ING L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once before , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but they played this part perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins of 5 @-@ 4 at Target Field .
the T@@ wins lost a chance to climb to the top right of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Game .
for Detroit , although only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that had so difficult to gras@@ p about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter what happens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tig@@ ers manager Brad dem@@ and@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit foc@@ uss@@ ed three times in the first two interior , then in the sixth and then once again ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times to the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three rings .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of each game , and therefore I want to go into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , its first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits vs the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the pl@@ ywood all well , &quot; she said , &quot; she said .
he looked good with singing training ) , clearly seen better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three rings in the rear at the end of the seventh year , T@@ wins had their best chance to come into the game again .
Center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ xton finished that inning with a double on the left field line .
right H@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon launched his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier for the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy left .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with which he was confron@@ ted with designer from the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie de Miguel S@@ ano , who ab@@ dic@@ ated the right @-@ run Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen .
with a pair of lights and the finale @-@ run in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen led the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ff into a double play .
it was the major league leading the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe held a double play
after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run in the end of the ninth inside , this wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , S@@ ano come in at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit benef@@ ited from a start of the game from a yet not moving Phil Hughes .
the Tig@@ ers scored three rings in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been canc@@ eled before the game of the po@@ aching list after he had ste@@ als more than a month .
&quot; apparently , not the beginning I wanted to make for myself , &quot; said Hughes , &quot; but I felt happ@@ ier than I was rele@@ asing and felt that I would create a quite good pitch since the third inning . &quot;
after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ aving awarded a single to Second Baz@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z eliminated its 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos , with a single on the right , managed to get another Run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was eliminated from the game when he was trying to get to the third , what the threat .
the tig@@ ers were placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins ist Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not go well , but he caught the right spot .
Hughes was in a pitch @-@ count that had no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hughes , there came to three rings at six hits and a walk with four cords .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sanchez was out due to inf@@ rin@@ gement of the litter school .
it is explored by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , on the crash list for a shoulder @-@ breaking list , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with Sanchez out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is canc@@ eled by the po@@ aching list to fight against the T@@ wins .

Isch@@ l : German military measures in Syria a option
the director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang K@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the definite re@@ thinking about military action plans cannot be held without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective action . &quot;
four years ago , it was glad that the cup has gone by a military involvement in Germany .

but he who does not have a lead @-@ in @-@ perspective , can &apos;t remain in Germany .
this view was expressed in the turn of the turn .
the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole had to overcome a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees now stuck on the can@@ can@@ oe route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia during the night .

the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain lots of sugar
man@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his sl@@ ender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
healthy fruits nonetheless are the exotic fruits : in them B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. Some contain traces of vitamin A and the pre @-@ stage beta @-@ car@@ otene .
those who eat the fruit , therefore support sight , immune systems , and metabolic processes in the body .
when you buy man@@ gos are not too soft or firm , and pleas@@ antly warm .
the form@@ work color alone doesn &apos;t say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so you can taste green man@@ os very tasty .
they should be kept at room temperature and within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or pure food .

his negative impressions will probably gam@@ bled him according to histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then had initiated the split in the Dutch church with his thes@@ es against de@@ fl@@ yers .
hammer artist invested three years in the Bible &apos;s personal interpretation
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his bi@@ ds .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and reading Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has appeared with exquisite paintings .
in the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , who set up his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but whatever is not much syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adjusted on the relevant themes , this can be quite dark .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt used to work on his Bible project for which he has made a sub@@ jective selection of the many theme areas of the book of all books . &quot;
some cycles , subjects like cru@@ sts , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or Father are dedicated to each other .
he spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost &apos;s author , who dealt with the basis of painting with the respective Bible records .
he has interpreted the Bible verses from Ot@@ mar Alt , and so to present &quot; under &quot; new connections . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
embedded in the original Bible @-@ style of Martin Luther and with a set of the artist who form@@ ulates his personal thoughts about their respective situation here .
the jewelry cord has gold tones .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows dou@@ bly deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
that is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions became ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler of the Order .
&quot; since the up@@ bringing happened with the pipeline , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to get up my work to myself again with the Lord my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ lie@@ ve art in faster time again , &quot; The perception of image worlds is influenced by advertisement and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being diver@@ ted out there .
artists have a different desire and bl@@ iss to show things .
pictures always have somewhat mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to &quot; draw the viewers into the pictures , &quot; and let them appear , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is searching for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost signed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; which is always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art . &quot; I like what he will gras@@ p with his images . &quot;
I did not care to understand the Bible , but which is important for him , also mysterious issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains merely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pictures from the Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans Mö@@ ller by Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts imag@@ ery speak for both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and f@@ lax@@ seed images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will open on November 15th at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction work for BM@@ X railway
plans made , place found , contrac@@ ted , set up the hills for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was ready again .
sow@@ ing events in politics and management , especially with the residents who did not toler@@ ate the train .
therefore , hill are deported , new place - well with formal planning and application for building permission .
the permission was made in October , the first Municipal Gover@@ ning Board , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock , was now able to communicate now in the youth and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will still be visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , without &quot; further mem@@ oration &quot; he was supposed to start working with the former swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment for refugees to 2019 in the Bundesliga , setting a clear signal on the weekend .
football re@@ acts on the pit@@ ching situation in Germany , where policies support his assistance to the problems encountered by the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in the principle , that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in every particular interest to get this subject in the grip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany inten@@ sively .
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chancell@@ ery and meet there State Minister of State , Ö@@ zo@@ di@@ z , and ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football player can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs needs to make politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German football League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Foundation we ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach explained on the edge of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ del@@ a will be presenting a clear sign if it takes place on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; at the left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make sure that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sporting leader Rud@@ i Vö@@ ller , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) , described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama takes every one , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can take football cards , no , we need to use our sho@@ al power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke about a &quot; prominent signs of the league . &quot;
the Euro 2016 quali@@ fier against Hungary on this Friday charges the women &apos;s women for 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Kid@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large common German football team . &quot;
that all 36 roy@@ alties should have started their own projects in their home , was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we have spent will be living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this and the next year , the association will collabor@@ ate with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government for 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also been ph@@ oned off for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kid@@ s@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
report : SAP head office loses an accident with accident
the head of President of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , according to several reports revealed by a fall into the left eye at the start of July .
if the accident oc@@ cured at the steps in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he came to a water@@ front that he has worn in the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is nearly bloo@@ dless , she was getting out of tow@@ ed down to the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could but go after his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager would be able to meet and &quot; fully work . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software pow@@ erh@@ ouse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I stood at regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t from the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
typically , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually assem@@ bles between Germany and the U.S. , but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it matters to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to get up again when you are dropped . &quot;

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar : past@@ el f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes gathered for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the first group game of the Europa League final .
the national player is also absent from the football @-@ league in the du@@ el in the du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t go back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether R@@ EU@@ s will be in the Bundesliga match in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left : &quot; we expect a return of it into the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his regular position on the R@@ EU@@ s position .
so he announced a change to go@@ al@@ ights .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place in the place of the Roman Cham@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the football teacher , the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is being used in the future in all European @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left it open however .
with a high lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood he will also contest the second game .
the statement of co @-@ def@@ enders of R@@ EU@@ s , that the final one for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League , must be the destination for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League , explains the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for it : &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to grab the title . &quot;
robot cars : government wants pioneering role in Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany will be a leading technological lead by the Federal Government .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided to take a strategy paper from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , amongst other things , fore@@ sees investments in expanding digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the ver@@ ge of the Autom@@ echan@@ Show of a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase the traffic safety and take less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counterpart from the G7 states , which will also come together with representatives of the industry .
the strategy of strategy adopted by the Ministry of Education , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a generous transfer to digital radio .
testing new technology is currently taking a test ride on the 9 in Bavaria .
with the driver &quot; no additional payment risks &quot; to be br@@ ushed , &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework conditions , &quot; and it is necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make around international that the allow@@ able maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per kilometer .
the Federal Government also intends to use the Federal Convention for a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees people as drivers .
when automated driving takes over , the car will take leadership , the driver will carry more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , high @-@ automated driving on motor@@ ways will be possible technically by 2020 .
nevertheless , more mobile vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the high @-@ automated driving positions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study by 2025 at approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the P@@ c@@ ws lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD &apos;s traffic officer S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the question of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver has to be clari@@ fied clearly .
the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday survey of the For@@ sa @-@ Institute on behalf of the Test of the For@@ sa @-@ Institute on behalf of the Test of Test , DE@@ K@@ RA will believe that only eight percent of the German people believe that self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will not prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent believe not at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 has advanced cars , 33 percent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not willing to leave themselves completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
according to a survey of the digital publisher Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire ride on all roads .
on the highway , you could see at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent .
good each V@@ ence would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo &apos;s title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ stra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM Course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a qu@@ ail @-@ gra@@ c@@ et c@@ et : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented a special exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins look unique due to video projections .
they wear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , which amongst others were played with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say today that I &apos;m a fan of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I got white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was un@@ easy , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that fashion designers has changed its departure attitude towards a show over his person .
actually he had been on the other hand , because : &quot; for me a show was a little bit &apos; for me , &quot; he said .
when you die , one comes into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been in the Canadian Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into which hardly an over@@ looked work of the man , written in history , without ever completed a training .
chron@@ ologically the show is not constructed , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ograph@@ ed universal artwork , working for the much effort : to devour the dolls , for example , a styl@@ ist is involved .
14 tons of material have been mo@@ cked to Munich according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
shortly before the Oc@@ tober@@ fest@@ a there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather tro@@ t @-@ out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
he has always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are clever as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said G@@ aul .
the Gaul@@ ti@@ ers @-@ old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , fierce salary attempts by the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , said G@@ aul .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
so the throw of fashion he has taught himself later .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , as Gaul@@ tier did in Munich .
later I bought it later on .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing , but they could maintain the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Platinum head as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ dery in and around Pl@@ auen , turning round .
the embroi@@ dered substances and lace were made up of great quantity for customers looking for example to bl@@ ank@@ ets and curtains .
today , the alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains the management of its upper floors .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early hours of the pl@@ ump , fashion plays a greater role , then it was pushed into a native textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls several examples : tip in jewelry , as accessories such as po@@ ckets and for regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage fashion which leans on past bul@@ let , an increasing client potential .
who is no longer operated in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer available on the market .
by us they already make half of the jobs done .
mother@@ boards Pl@@ auen , together with nine other companies , is a member of the pupp@@ y pl@@ under@@ ed and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they can bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years about 80 percent of sales were broken .
private trade transactions and wholesale trade is almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach our customers in this path .
the mass ware in Asian countries are much cheaper in the Asian region , and almost exclusively marketed throughout chains .
moreover , export will be exported , currently to Russia and to the United States .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also attempts to score through environment awareness like Cord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery in Falk@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality , that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; that also refers to the materials used . &quot;
designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger branch office of the western Sax@@ on School of Z@@ wick@@ au , Faculty of Applied Arts - speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of designer and businesses that must be thinking mainly economically , &quot; says Shi@@ res .
therefore , a existing design is often only easy to keep a customer base .
some years ago , the textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter animated the historic snow @-@ sole .
the machine sticks some little kis@@ ses in some places .
the au@@ au@@ ged Gold@@ smith in Bi@@ anca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ ch inspired them : &quot; before that , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener past@@ ures . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ tip for their jewellery .
in a complex process , they shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of pl@@ ot@@ ting - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies us to the U.S. , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors had lived in space and surroundings and want to find a souvenir .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the pl@@ au@@ ener .

according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; it is not a curiosity , but just a continuation , which plays a continuation of 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl .
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the Banks in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI t@@ ushes to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must open wider out@@ ward , to promote growth , &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , on Tuesday , a group which was commissioned to reform the reform .
&quot; China should set up for making foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business founders , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Management Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
new start @-@ ups to promote and refine the reforms will bring new moment@@ um and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the guide group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population growth system .
after the statement , a neg@@ ativity was created , which sectors and enterprises that are not eligible for investment .
the system is tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , as it refers to the market a greater part in the allocation of resources , a legally governmental business field provides and the open market , said the statement .
the government will also make controls on the companies that are transmitted by the company and make sure companies will decide how they lead their businesses .
the statement also said that China will permit Chinese border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic operation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in the scope of an offer to open nation@@ ally controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the right interests of foreign @-@ financed businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by being facil@@ itated by the requirements and the application process will be easier .
the right to ass@@ ure lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and major leader such as Liu Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part in the meeting , as announced in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes
the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in big pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to make consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve impul@@ ses .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is an appropriate working paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans to critic@@ ise : &quot; risks and side effects of inf@@ alli@@ ble industrial and environmental policy , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is projected to increase the limit values of the nerve toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy , &quot; of one to two milli@@ gram of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
big pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are so strongly stressed with mercury , that on basis of existing mar@@ gins , some 50 per cent of the fet@@ ters cannot be sold .
after dou@@ bling the mar@@ g@@ inal values , only a 14.@@ 5 per cent would be mis@@ leading .
in exchange for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values with other f@@ ishings at the time of 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
