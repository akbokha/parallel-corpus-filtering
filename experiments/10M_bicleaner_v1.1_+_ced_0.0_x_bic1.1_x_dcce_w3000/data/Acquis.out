&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures required in implementing the provisions of the part I on backup measures as required .
the aim of the securing measures established in this Convention is the timely discovery of the absorption significant quantities of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rent of such a branch through the risk of premature ejaculation .
for the mat@@ ing of the target in Article 28 , the material preservation is used as a backup measure of fundamental importance , related with the spatial division and observation as an important supple@@ mental measures .
the technical conclusion of the test testing by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material image zone which is listed for a certain period of time , indicating the most precise limits for the specified measurement .
when carrying out their check@@ ups , the organisation makes for articles 3 full use of the security system of the Community .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear material according to this Convention is based upon an outline in material bil@@ it@@ ating areas .
the use of their backup measures will make use of de @-@ Proc@@ ed@@ ure and measures as far as necessary , fores@@ ee as far as required , how they are closer and functional in the complementary paragrap@@ hs .
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserv@@ ated , failed , lost or otherwise from the continu@@ ance of remote material and of inventory ;
B ) the evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the assessment of measurement certainty ;
C ) procedures for the determination , testing and assessment of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) method for evaluation of accumulation not measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material and the changes of that stock , including the one - and out@@ puts of the material image ;
g ) precautions that make sure that the accounting procedures and agreements are correctly carried out ;
h ) procedure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the backup measures after this agreement do not extend to material in the mining industry or on the preparation preparation .
B ) Ur@@ an ( or th@@ or@@ ical material which is not yet reached under letter c ) described the phase of the nuclear fuel grid yet , in the States , the community of organization divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material that is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel production or the process phase , in which it is manufactured or is introduced this core material or other , in a later phase of the core fuel grid in the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures referred to in this Convention .
a ) The backup measures envisaged in this Convention will not be cancelled in Article 11 conditions . however , the Community considers that the recovery of nuclear material , the backup measures is subject to this agreement , is temporary not possible or desirable , so consult the organization and the community on each other via the use of appropriate backup measures .
B ) The backup measures envisaged in this Convention will be cancelled on core materials under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and community are cons@@ enting to the fact that this core material is practically non @-@ profitable .
upon request the community releases the organisation the following key material from the backup measures following this Convention :
a ) special sp@@ il@@ able material if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities by Article 13 if such nuclear material is re@@ profitable , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an Is@@ ot@@ open@@ con@@ centric of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
looking for the community releases the organisation of nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to backup measures imposed after this Convention as long as the whole , due to this article in the states liber@@ ite nuclear material quantity no longer amounts than
a ) a total of a kilo@@ gram@@ m@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enri@@ ching of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment which lies below 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above the natur@@ alisation , is calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with the fi@@ ff@@ ian square of en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of natural shapes and de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ an@@ ium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty m@@ etric ton de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ an@@ ium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
the liber@@ ated core material together with kernel material , which is subject to backup measures imposed after this Convention , will be processed or stored , so precautions will be taken for re@@ use of he@@ dging operations on the material .
the Community meets with the Organisation Supp@@ lements arising in the scope , which is required for the successful and effective replacement of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , in particular , in which the procedures specified in the Convention are applicable .
supple@@ mental agreements can be changed or modified without amendment of this Convention in the agreement between the Organisation and the Community .
supple@@ mental announcements will come into force simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention . the Organisation , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the withdrawal between the organization , the community and the States .
the organization focuses on the basis of the initial reporting of the entire , the securing measures of this Convention underlying the Convention in the States , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory index on account of the following reports and the results of their test inspections .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand
in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ER NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ UN@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to help the conference for international economic cooperation established special action program to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ per@@ ed by general resource @-@ sector problems .
C ) It is the EEC and the Member States that the whole of the Member States made a contribution within six months of the agreement , as far as possible within two years of entry into force of loan , and the organisation will do its best to achieve that goal .
( D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed performance and administration of the agreement and the intermedi@@ aries to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC has presented a table which is inten@@ tional in which way they intended to apply the criteria set in this agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organisation is a special account under the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special Account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which , from the joint statement , will be led to the Special Representative ; this account is referred to by the organization as ste@@ ward fi@@ du@@ ciary and used ( in this property the organisation is referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purposes set out in this agreement and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Special Account will be separate and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is carried out in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic guilt of the member state that must be paid upon request in the currency of the relevant state to order the organization as administrator of the Special Agreement , and in question of organisation of organisation in the relevant country .
B ) The payment is performed in two rates , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution in 30 days after the agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon ;
II ) the second part of the remainder of the paper on 1 January 1979 or at another time , between the EEC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) each member state can make payments before the above @-@ mentioned termin@@ ations .
the ste@@ ward decreases in accordance with the usual procedures of the Organisation for dis@@ proportionate measures to the cash or the school , in order to cover expenses for the specialized loan and the special requests in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of these loans , the bai@@ li@@ ff will be guided by the following factors in accordance with the following factors :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and predictable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit capacity for loan conditions without charges ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries are based on contributions from other sources .
any special application loan will serve the financing of a clearly identifiable and fast @-@ payable development program or pre @-@ requ@@ isi@@ tion ( including a sec@@ toral Plan ) , which applies regardless of whether it is considered to the loan program of organisation or not , according to the proceedings and practices , which is approved for proper funds of the organization financed , approved , approved and administered by decre@@ e ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the Special Con@@ tac@@ tos must not be used instead of strict funds from the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation who have already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of its adoption .
aside from Section 4 are subject to special redund@@ ancy loan granted the same payout conditions , which are generally considered by the Organisation for Development . they are therefore refundable in ten years of open @-@ years .
special agreements will be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts for payment of these containers are directly to the organization that it reserves .
any given loan will be specified by a separate loan agreement between the addres@@ see and the administrator , in which particular the origin of the funds is indicated .
the revenue from any given loan can be used for expenditure in the currency of the addres@@ land or for goods or services that are made or used in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator would have indicated at the time of the loan granted , recei@@ vers of a special request .
grants of special payments will take place at the special request account , and the amount paid to this in the currency of a member state is returned to its receipt as soon as possible by the bai@@ li@@ ff to the concerned Member State .
the bai@@ li@@ ff has taught the EEC for the full allocation of all special requests to the EEC on the examination of the directors in preparation and about the projects approved by the directors .
during the time of the payout of the Special Representative , the EEC has been informed quarterly on the development of special agreements and the closing issues .
the Council submitted to the EEC as soon as possible after the closing of the financial year of the organisation , an exhaustive brief@@ ing of the special application account with an assessment of the external audi@@ tor of the organization on this account .
after full withdrawal of the UN &apos;s loan , the Council submitted to the EEC as soon as possible will provide a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the Special Account Agreement and programmes .
the ste@@ ward creates and conduc@@ ts appropriate records and billing , from which the contributions attributed to the Special Account , which have received from the conformity and paid out of the account amounts and the withdraw@@ als paid to the member states .
the EEC and the bai@@ li@@ ff work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the bai@@ li@@ ff to the full issue of the Special Convention provides an exchange of thoughts about the state of the special agreement , the advancement of the programmes or plans and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement reached on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the EEC and the Organisation , if necessary , do not come into force , the agreement and all the constitu@@ ent obligations of the parties must be charged with immediate effect .

the draw would take place in the BC@@ Z with conclusion of the agreement at the disposal currencies , very likely in U.S. dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the funds of the bank , expected three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which comply with the B@@ IS at the point of time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would correspond to largely the sets of market .
if the B@@ IS has to take the necessary means on the market itself , then the pending interest rate might be a maximum , which corresponds to the corresponding margin of increased Li@@ bor .

a re@@ agent for blood group@@ ing has to react with all tested blood samples that contain the tigen @-@ contained , which is hom@@ olo@@ gue on the antibodies or another on the label .
if a re@@ agent in which is recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hä@@ mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the title is measured by ever again di@@ lution of the looking re@@ agent to double in a suitable medium . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the number of strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by the blood flow of blood flow in the total volume .
with anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents who are to be used to object , the activity is expressed by the time that is required for a ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has fixed for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood @-@ determination International norms , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are being worked out at the time .
a International standard supplement contains according to definition a certain number of national units per mg / ml , and this definition is independent of the titles , which are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to blood @-@ group control of most specific@@ ity is expressed as Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ isation , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic in@@ und@@ ation .
the ti@@ ter indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series , where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ically visible Ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group reduction , available for the International standard prepar@@ es ( at the time Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B ) as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title of Un@@ known Re@@ agent in comparison to the International standard supplement or state standards in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .

a re@@ agent led under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer shall keep his required properties at least one year long .
the expiry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to the label is a maximum of one year after the last satisfactory efficiency test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the shelf tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ active gas or in a vacuum , and indeed in the glass container , where they are dried and which is so locked so that no moisture can inv@@ ade .
a dry re@@ agent is allowed to lose at most 0,5 v.@@ H. his weight if it is tested through phosph@@ or@@ ous pent@@ ine under pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or those added with the dr@@ y@@ re@@ agents supplied ) an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

the re@@ agents for the international exchange of re@@ agents for blood @-@ reduction should not be colored in arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an International Convention on a uniform system has come about .
re@@ agents for blood @-@ determination to be spread in such a way and in such amounts that these circul@@ ates in a container not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative controversi@@ es .
the quantity required in a container must be so big that the content is necessary for performing the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing truste@@ es has to lead through all production stages and controls of re@@ agents to detect blood @-@ group records .
appropriate samples of all re@@ plac@@ ements are to be kept as long from the lab system , until with some likelihood may be accepted that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood @-@ groups can contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary means to enhance the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of its effective fund in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black on white label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and ad@@ ress of the manufacturer ,
