this document is a summary of the European Public Appe@@ al report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the studies conducted by Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please refer to the Pack@@ ages ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets ( tablets , which dis@@ solve itself in the mouth ) , as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. enter@@ re thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , mis@@ trust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients maneu@@ ver episodes ( periods of abnormal floods ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal spirits .
bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe to severe man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of Man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection of inj@@ ecting is applied to rapid control of infl@@ ated anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders when the or@@ ic intake of the drug is not possible .
for both cases , the solution to remove or the mel@@ ting tablets can be applied in patients where the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines which are exactly as bili@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of as@@ bili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole mostly works as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters appears to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin is a role to play Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , eliminating psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevent their recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of bili@@ fy , to prevent re @-@ emergence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies by up to one year .
the effectiveness of inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophrenia , or similar diseases , compared to a period of two hours with a placebo .
in a further study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared more than twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ operated i@@ dol , in a different study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo that have been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients where man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with astr@@ fy disease .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injections was made in a study on 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered over @-@ led un@@ rest , compared with the lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering on the treatment were examined .
the company also led studies through to investigate how the body absorbed the mel@@ ting tablets and the solution to inv@@ ading ( records ) .
in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg , or 15 mg , a significantly stronger lowering of the symptoms conc@@ il@@ ted un@@ rest than the patients who received a placebo .
when applying to the bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies have been more effective than placebo .
bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo the recur@@ rence of Man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms hal@@ ted un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ pr@@ id@@ al disorders ( un@@ contro@@ ll@@ ery ) , se@@ dation ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , se@@ dation ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , p@@ essi@@ mis@@ ation ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) got to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schizophrenia and from the severe to heavy episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes focused on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
in addition , the committee also came to the conclusion that the benefits of inj@@ ecting inj@@ ecting disturbed anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when a or@@ ale therapy is not suitable for the risks .
June 2004 the European Commission granted Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for approval for the in@@ duction of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is used for the treatment of moderate to heavy episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophrenia and non @-@ polar disorder in patients over 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icide behaviour belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective dys@@ functions and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , including treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of suffici@@ ency with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( myo@@ cardi@@ ac disease , transi@@ tions ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure recept@@ ors or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ related Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if with an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ dy@@ sk@@ i@@ esis , should be considered to reduce the dose or to dis@@ rupt the treatment .
if a patient signs signs and symptoms that suggest a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tic , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be deduc@@ ted .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ ires in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at intervals , which are to be used with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , increased ster@@ ber@@ ized compared to placebo .
there were however in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ k@@ or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug @-@ treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed by schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar management , the application of anti@@ psycho@@ tic , where weight gain is known as low @-@ effect , or may lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with proven side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ is Fam@@ oti@@ din , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ p@@ rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects and therefore similar can be carried out .
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans may result in common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plastic con@@ centric parts of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abol@@ ism .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ants , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can be carried out .
after lowering the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage should be raised by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the dosage above the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em or E@@ sc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day no significant effect on the metabol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data base for people and the resulting concerns in animal studies , this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy , unless the possible utility is justi@@ fies the potential risk to the fo@@ etus .
however , even with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics patients should be warned of the patient , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects appeared more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .

in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
maneu@@ ver episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial for 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under half @-@ operated i@@ dol treatment .
in a different study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term donation phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 15,@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between the patient @-@ groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo at which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine @-@ controlled laboratory parameters , were not medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ opho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.@@ 0 % of patients treated with placebo .
among the side @-@ effects associated with an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and about their appearance also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ic@@ uous events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the launch of launch un@@ inten@@ tional or degra@@ dations with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated cans of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
while there is no information on the effectiveness of a her@@ al@@ zation in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; it is unlikely , that hem@@ pi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has high plasma cutting .
it is suspected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during schizophrenia and bio @-@ I disorder over the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .

in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo over placebo over three weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus placebo no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo over placebo over placebo over placebo over a week 3 and a entertaining effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semi@@ conductor in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also pointed out 12 a comparative proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia on such as lithium or semi@@ conductor .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics that partially about 2 weeks did not match Li@@ ion@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ ate @-@ mon@@ otherapy in therapeu@@ tical symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .

based on vit@@ ro studies the enzy@@ mes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ cy@@ ber is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ ites above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and in nearly 14@@ 6 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as demonstrated in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schizophrenia , not gender @-@ dependent effects .
a high @-@ specific evaluation of the Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics revealed no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmaceuticals of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison with young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study at Pro@@ ban@@ den with different eng@@ or@@ gers liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on security mat@@ ology , toxicity , toxicity , toxicity , and for can@@ cer@@ o@@ genic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data left no particular haz@@ ards to humans .
toxic@@ ological effects were observed merely in doses or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so that they have limited liability for clinical use only .
the effects captured a dos@@ is@@ @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney @-@ toxicity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ ine @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ fat cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at € 20 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10@@ mg / kg / day ) at least 10@@ mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis in humans ) .

the effectiveness of my@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study where 4@@ 60 women attended with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters of previously had an Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in all gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with that of a conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug , compared with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall research in the main study was 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with my@@ x@@ ane @-@ treated patients on treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine .
considering only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there have been no difference in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of disease and survival .
it was reflected in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that my@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine .
it should also not be used in patients , breastfeeding or before the start of the treatment of low neutral phil@@ anthrop@@ ism in the blood .
the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) found that my@@ x@@ ane was no longer propos@@ ing , effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug , and that unlike other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines was not given to other medicines to decrease side @-@ effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2008 the European Commission granted the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An Bio@@ Science Limited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a permit for the ab@@ duction of my@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ st in patients when the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is not shown and is not shown for default anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine therapy ( see also section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ count number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ pa@@ thy during the my@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sensor@@ ic neuro@@ pa@@ thy degree 3 the treatment will break down until a bet@@ tering to degree 1 or 2 is achieved , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4th and 5.2 ) .
no studies conducted with patients with com@@ promised kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment to patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
my@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness .
my@@ x@@ ane is an album @-@ bound@@ ed nan@@ op@@ artic@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could show essentially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should immediately be deduc@@ ted and symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in the patients no re@@ pro@@ x@@ ane @-@ treatment cycles should be introduced until the neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ are has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x U@@ LN or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x U@@ LN ) should not be treated with my@@ x@@ ane .
while one clearly has been proven with my@@ x@@ ane in connection related cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardi@@ ac abnorm@@ alities are not uncommon in the inde@@ xed patient collective , especially in patients with previous anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine or underlying cardi@@ ac or lun@@ atic disease .
in case with the patients after the gift of my@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ e@@ tics and counter li@@ pi@@ ous means .
an@@ x@@ ane should not be used by pregnant or in women of child@@ bearing age , which are not being used for effective contrac@@ eption , except treatment of mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avoidable .
women of child@@ bearing age should be used during and up to 1 month after the treatment with my@@ x@@ ane seeds .
male patients who are treated with my@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after treatment no child to bear witness .
male patients should be advised before treating a sperm count since treatment with my@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irreversible in@@ fertility .
my@@ x@@ ane can cause unwanted side effects like fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the mode of traffic and the ability to operate machines .
below are the most common and important incidents of side effects listed at 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 my@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most remarkable important hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( reported at 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly re@@ sealed and dos@@ is@@ depending ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / d@@ l ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with my@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / d@@ l ) .
in Table 1 the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of my@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication have occurred in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .

since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual incidence is possible and there has been no caus@@ al connection with these events .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules , which promotes the de@@ position of the micro @-@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhi@@ bitions of their land@@ fill pol@@ ym@@ eri@@ zation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ o@@ tic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ine provides the trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components in the endo@@ th@@ el@@ cells and in the context of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ ine promotes the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ th@@ eli@@ um cells .
it is thought that this improved tran@@ sit@@ e@@ eli@@ al transport is conve@@ yed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ ator or and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein &apos;s SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic , in c@@ yst@@ eine ) is a Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of my@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ om is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ bed studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparison .
in a study , 43 patients treated with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om with my@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ om .
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ el , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ size Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with medication for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of my@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without em@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
when taking into the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response and time until progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ line therapy are laid down below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by enhancing a degree of patient who lived at a time during treatment a peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy degree 3 .
the natural course of peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy for bot@@ tling at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxicity of my@@ x@@ ane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of my@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was established in clinical trials .
the substance ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous gift of my@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ plasma took the Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation in Multi ph@@ as@@ hic way .
the mean volume of distribution was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or Wei@@ cht@@ eil@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ vent @-@ resistant Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was with my@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissues , it is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metabo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 with x@@ ane in patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ ter@@ isation of the un@@ altered active ingredient of 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ tional Clear@@ ance .
however , more than 75 patients were only available for patients at the age of 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis .

it is used in patients with normal blood levels whereby in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications could occur if prior to the procedure a self @-@ blood circulation is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with se@@ amed must be introduced under the supervision of a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders that will display the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood @-@ blood circulation , it is to be inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or its staff , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .

the Iron values of all patients are before the treatment to ensure that no iron lack exists , and Iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive a chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ yl or thereby that the body does not sufficiently on the physical er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the effects of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced into which a gene ( DNA ) brought it to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
se@@ amed was compared to administration as an injection in a v@@ ein as part of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been in@@ quired for at least eight weeks as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein , before they either were placed at se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indication of the efficacy was the change in the h@@ ull values between the beginning of the study and the validity period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study where the effects of under the skin bl@@ amed under the skin bl@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the h@@ emo@@ fl@@ amm@@ able intake of patients were ren@@ amed to ab@@ amed , to the same extent as with those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this showed the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l .
the most common side @-@ effect of se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , ste@@ eping mig@@ pu@@ zz@@ ling headaches and con@@ fu@@ sions .
se@@ amed must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , since further studies are required to make sure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) got to the conclusion that for se@@ amed comp@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been shown that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

controlled clinical trials have not shown any significant benefit , which is due to the gift of epo@@ chs , if the hem@@ mo@@ bell @-@ concentration on the necessary concentration of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions is increased .

for tum@@ our patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay should be considered for the assessment of the treatment efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ coded ) .
if the H@@ B increase is higher than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ B value of 13 g / d@@ l ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance to Section 4.2 ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therapies related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim to keep the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ ck@@ le between 10 g / d@@ l and 12 g / d@@ l ) .
the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ etine should be based on a health risk assessment taking part in each patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients , which are intended for greater electri@@ fying orthop@@ edic surgical procedure , if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a larger el@@ ective orthop@@ edic surgery should have an appropriate th@@ rot@@ ary prophy@@ la@@ xis , since they have an increased risk for thro@@ mbo@@ genic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly for the underlying cardiovascular disease .
moreover , it cannot be excluded that in the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting range of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an elevated risk for post@@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ genic / vas@@ cular events can exist .
in several controlled trials it was not proven for epo@@ etine that they can improve overall survival with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or l@@ essen the risk of tum@@ our .

the most common side @-@ effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ lic events ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ds .

survival and tumor growth were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ e@@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treated patients and the control patient .
in these studies the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treated patients with an an@@ a@@ emia due to several common mal@@ ign@@ ant in@@ consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and thus @-@ related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treated patients and in controls are satisfactory .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ genic events in tum@@ ours events that are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tum@@ our pati@@ os that are treated with chemotherapy with the aim to transfer a h@@ emo@@ glo@@ omy between 13 g / d@@ l , since a few patients were included in these characteristics with these characteristics .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is applied to the treatment of the following illnesses : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high risk risk ( bone bur@@ sts ) , including in patients who recently suffered a sli@@ pper@@ y hip . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should get a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ in@@ ox@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflammation ) just after applying Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms in the three days following in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle aches , flu pain , pain and headaches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta must be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease .
since the ingredient in acet@@ one is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data collection for Zom@@ eta was drawn up to the evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ rates and hips have been studied over a period of three years .
the second study comprised of 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently had suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indication of the efficacy was whether the content of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme which is building bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced compared to the patients under placebo by 70 % compared to the patients .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those on placebo the risk of hat@@ so@@ cks was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta appear within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
action may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to customs acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients are subject to risk of kidney , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ass ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides guidance material for doctors ready to use Ac@@ la@@ sta in the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how the drug use , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .
April 2005 the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the adoption of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union .

the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis - in case of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk to frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic sc@@ ure frac@@ ture .
in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended to a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta every year .
for patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long @-@ emission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure that in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic sc@@ ure frac@@ ture , an initi@@ al@@ dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by a gift of acet@@ am@@ ole or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ loading .
patients with kidney disorder ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as limited clinical experience has been available for these patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age , since data is missing for un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) since this patient population has only limited clinical experience .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is before the start of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid deployment of the effects of customs acid on bone loss , a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ine can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure that in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer treatment , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be weigh@@ ed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate correc@@ tive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental handles , do not contain data , whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the j@@ aw area .
clinical evaluation by the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days of administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by a gift of acet@@ am@@ ole or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ la@@ x ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of as serious secondary effect reported cases by atri@@ al wor@@ sen was in patients who received the Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2,@@ 6 % ) and placebo ( 2,@@ 1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted effects are listed in chart 1 .
kidney disorder has been associated with renal dys@@ functions , which was associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured against administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure , as well as a reduced renal function were comparable in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with accounts of 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory tests , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium range , which are below the normal pregnancy range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with accounts in one major clinical trial , compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies treated patients .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D @-@ level were measured not rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initi@@ al@@ dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of customs acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the j@@ aw area occasionally has been reported mainly in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the j@@ aw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates including customs acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including Oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients according to tooth extraction or other entries .
7 study involving 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ass in the j@@ aw area with accounts with Ac@@ la@@ sta and in one with placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ a@@ emia , can be achieved through gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium intake .
clinical efficiency in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been pointed out at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( BM@@ D ) with either a bone frac@@ ture ( BM@@ D ) or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the Schengen h@@ als &lt; -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing il@@ bla@@ frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ om@@ etric cycl@@ or@@ co@@ ders ac@@ la@@ sta significantly significantly over a period of three years as well as already after a year the frequency of one or more new spine of verteb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and above had decreased by 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta reported a consistent effect over three years , resulting in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % up to 58 % ) reduced the risk of the frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density at the thor@@ ac@@ ic acid , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment significantly to all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 increase the bone density of the steering wheel by 6.@@ 7 % , the total per@@ pen@@ cils by 6.@@ 0 % , of the Schengen angle as a 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius around 3.@@ 2 % .
bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the patient @-@ treated patients compared to placebo for an increase in the tra@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ cular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ ates ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pe@@ p@@ ti@@ d of type @-@ C ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in Ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dosage Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced b@@ SAP after 12 months significant by 30 % compared to the output value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output level after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the output level until 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output level until 36 months .
the vitamin D @-@ mirror were measured not rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 - oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
overall performance was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study raised the acet@@ D @-@ treatment in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D at the total po@@ stage and th@@ ig@@ saw at all time points .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % at the overall height and around 4.3 % at the Schengen area .
clinical efficiency in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ised and evaluated in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged by 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7,5 % at accounts @-@ treated men compared to 8,@@ 7 % on placebo .
in a different study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , once again was the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to the once weekly notification of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at related to the percentage change in the Len@@ vor@@ tex @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficiency of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the Kno@@ ck Pa@@ get the Kno@@ x Con@@ tract has been studied in patients aged over 30 years ago ( mean ser@@ um mirror of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ at@@ ase according to 2,@@ 6@@ lt to 3,@@ 0@@ times of age @-@ specific upper level in admission into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of customs acid in comparison with the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ er once daily during 2 months was proven in two six months compared .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of the pain strength and pain rel@@ ieve compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a resp@@ ite at the end of six months of trial ( to therapy ) , could be included in an after@@ math phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age @-@ treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach could be maintained in 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 of patients with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age , compared to 71 of the retro@@ monitoring period of 18 months after application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of customs acid at 64 patients received the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data that has proved to be dos@@ is@@ independently .
after that , the plastic bar took over at &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .

this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney disorder up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of customs acid requires .
since heavy kidney disorder ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ domestic Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available for this population , no statements are possible for this population .

decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially estrogen , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the more gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bon@@ ing process takes place fast , and new bone material is arranged un@@ arranged , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alized the bone building , thereby making a normal bone formation , thus giving the bone once again strength .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo any dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nursing staff if you have to apply other medicines and have recently been taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are drugs from which it is known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with foods and beverages you are worried that you can take sufficient fluid according to the instructions of your doctor before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your physician or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make administration of accounts two or more weeks after the operative care of the envelope .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your physician or the nurse as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you will possibly need another dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions precisely , so that the calcium mirror in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can take Ac@@ la@@ sta last longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration was missed by Ac@@ la@@ sta Set@@ ting you immediately with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date .
before ending the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta Falls you are considering the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( with over 30 % of the patients ) , are less frequent after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions but less frequent .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta is causing this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms with you after you received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Appe@@ al report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the studies conducted in Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
accounts are applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mono@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) . • It can be used together with a different di@@ abet@@ es@@ media medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ um or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ rogen or ins@@ ulin can be kept in the beginning of the account process , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ite or ins@@ ulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s ins@@ ulin can be used better and the blood sugar levels can be adjusted , whereby type @-@ 2 diabetes is better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of account in tri@@ ple@@ therapy has been examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ide , in addition they received either account for up to 3.5 years either account or placebo .
in studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
accounts led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows the blood sugar levels to be reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the extra gift from accounts to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ um in a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional load of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of accounts and ins@@ ulin in 2@@ 89 patients were examined , the patients received the account in addition to ins@@ ulin , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who were additionally placebo .
the most common side @-@ effects associated with accounts were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ra@@ dies@@ thes@@ ia ( decreasing sensitivity to irrit@@ ate ) .
accounts must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ tin ( high ket@@ one mirror ) - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos are intended to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients when met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a licence for the in@@ duction of accounts in the entire European Union .

Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also shown for the combination of ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficiently adjusted with ins@@ ulin and in which metals is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intolerance ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or estrogen , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain and oils , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardi@@ ological Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease has been carried out .
this study showed an increase in reports of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver illness may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
if the AL@@ T @-@ Spiegel increases up to 3 times the limit of the standard range , the liver enzy@@ mes are to control as soon as possible .
if a patient is developing symptoms that point to a hepati@@ c dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , thi@@ ck@@ ery , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or darker hard@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ mes to review .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the fores@@ ee of the laboratory parameters are led by the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be derived from fatty deposits , and in some cases associated with a liquid rep@@ airing .
as a result of a mo@@ tions occurred among the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a minor reduction of the middle skins ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ atively controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ ins and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity there is patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as or@@ ale branches or triple @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin gene therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ is@@ @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the launch of the market , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , reports on a occurrence or a deterioration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ul@@ de@@ ms with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , but prescribed doctors should report the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients should report on disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages unwanted events concerning bone bro@@ o@@ ds from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one

in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular abnorm@@ alities , questionn@@ aires reported at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 % of 0.5 million patients ) compared to patients treated with a comparative study .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be denied ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ is no relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynam@@ ic of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in exercises .

the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ us ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with cast@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) resulting in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is attributed to the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance by the cervi@@ cal and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .

these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ ors and the break@@ age inde@@ xes of the lens , as they are observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T covers the triple of the limit of the normal range as frequently as under placebo but less often than in compar@@ isons between met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ide .
in an Out@@ come study involving patients with advanced advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency carried out under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than under placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or w .
since the market launch has rarely been reported on cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , although Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was applied in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
there was a summary analysis of noti@@ fications about reported events concerning bone bro@@ o@@ ds from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and over 7.@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medi@@ ation .
over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , questionn@@ aires reported at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in case of taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to act on an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation ) , which leads in the animal model to an increased ins@@ ulin of liver , fats and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peri@@ pher@@ al gluten in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide used as mon@@ otherapy over two years in order to examine the time up to the retro@@ ination of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c = 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment , a blood sugar control could be defined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) due to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the patients treated under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .

the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mono@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks examination of type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials were observed in comparison to placebo a reduction in total plasma @-@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and a rise in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased the L@@ - cholesterol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ sia are the total plastic matri@@ mon@@ t@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ in@@ mirror .
compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed during Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide dimin@@ ished values were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ is not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de but improved in addition to the increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this both via a effect on the tri@@ gl@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the hepati@@ c tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ological Out@@ come study , 5@@ 2@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease , in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after or@@ ally application pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one gets rapidly resor@@ ted , whereby the peak concentration on un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one generally reaches 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effect of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interactions studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ is no relevant effect on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynam@@ ic of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e has been studied in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can produce no ins@@ ulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to utilize the ins@@ ulin effectively .
the study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els that pointed out that the blood sugar level were significantly reduced with a different human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ic ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ ap@@ han@@ e must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can impact on blood sugar ( the full list is the packing set ) .
the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) got to the conclusion that the advantages of acet@@ ap@@ han@@ e were ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks from diabetes to the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the adoption of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e in the European Union .
mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a fast @-@ initi@@ ale effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection must be absorbed by the skin at least 6 seconds in order to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar has improved significantly for example , for example , through an intense ins@@ ulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ a@@ emia symptoms have been altered and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , ins@@ ulin type ( quickly acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic , long acting ulin , etc . ) , type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin , ulin or ins@@ ulin ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against ins@@ ulin in animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage is needed .
in case of switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e in the patient a dosage adjustment is required , these may be necessary for the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the adjustment .
some patients in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions emerged after a change of animal on human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia less pronounced or different than in their previous ins@@ ulin .
before travelling , who go over several times of time , the patient should be advised to bring the Council of his physician since such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals should be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor should therefore take account of the possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients to ask for the drugs adopted by them .
4 Bot@@ h hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia which can occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ abet@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of abnorm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic can lead to consci@@ e@@ pl@@ essness and / or cr@@ amp@@ er , and with temporary or permanent dys@@ functions of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system occasionally - peri@@ pher@@ al Neuro@@ path@@ ia A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute neuro@@ pa@@ thy and usually rever@@ sible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of ins@@ ulin therapy with a rup@@ ting improvement of blood sugar can however be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabe@@ tic re@@ tin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the lower level of tissue , occasionally - Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy An der injection can arise when failed to switch the inser@@ tion inside the inj@@ ecting range .
common conditions and complaints at the date of time - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction to the inj@@ ecting location while ins@@ ulin therapy can occur local over@@ sensitive actions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the inj@@ ecting location ) .
diseases of the immune system occasionally - Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reactions , gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , it@@ ating , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ euro@@ tic oils , respir@@ ation , low blood pressure and impotence / consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia can however develop gradually : • Lei@@ ped hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic can be treated by the or@@ ale intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics therefore should always have grape copies , sweets , biscu@@ its or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1,@@ 0 mg ) by a designated agent or by glucose , given intraven@@ ously by the physician .
the effect starts within half an hour , the active max is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours .
Res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ tionary profile is based in it that the product is a mixture of ins@@ ulin products with rapid or hes@@ it@@ ant mortality .
a number of sp@@ il@@ isation ( hydro@@ ly@@ se@@ - ) places on the human@@ ic molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the met@@ alli@@ an@@ ed spl@@ itting is active .

this document is a summary of the European Public Appe@@ al report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the studies conducted by Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
the pharmac@@ eu@@ tic effective component in acet@@ ap@@ id , ins@@ ulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced with the procedure of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ .eu © E@@ MEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is for non commercial use only at the E@@ MEA is . how was Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id examined ?
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to ins@@ ulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the acquisition of acet@@ ap@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of ins@@ ulin is mixed , first the amount of ins@@ ulin re@@ ins need to be moved , then the amount of ins@@ ulin .
3 If the switch to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id is required when a dosage adjustment is required , it may be necessary for the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the adjustment .
before travelling , who go over several times of time , the patient should be advised to bring the Council of his physician since such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals should be applied or taken at other times .
5 General disorders and complaints at the date of time - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction to the inj@@ ecting location while ins@@ ulin therapy can occur local over@@ sensitive actions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the inj@@ ecting location ) .
diabe@@ tics therefore should always have grape copies , sweets , biscu@@ its or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1,@@ 0 mg ) by a designated agent or by glucose , given intraven@@ ously by the physician .

the effect starts within half an hour , the active max is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration of the duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and teenagers The pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id was examined at a smaller number ( s = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and teen@@ ager ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
data is limited , however the acceptance is close , that the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and young people is similar to that of adults .

during the first treatment months , tox@@ in cases can still occur , that is why the patients take at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic and other medicines to prevent sei@@ zur@@ es .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ ically l@@ ant as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , at which 1 0@@ 72 patients attended , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared with those of a placebo ( hypo@@ medication ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medicine to treat hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied at a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indication of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ureth@@ ra lay in the blood in the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once took 120 mg daily in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no one of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
particularly in patients with cardi@@ ac disease in pre @-@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing ur@@ inary tract in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .

if the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sow@@ ing brick is still taken into account after 2 @-@ 4 weeks ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dosage increase can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x per day .
for patients with severe kidney function , the effectiveness and safety have not been fully studied ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ domestic Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and tox@@ ins .
the primary efficacy point was in every study of the proportion of patients , in which the last three months of certain ser@@ um bags were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um in@@ der intake of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l .
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superiority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction in Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ os@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els to &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit to week 2 and keep permanently on the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x per day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney function@@ alities The AP@@ EX @-@ study reviewed the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function@@ alities ( D ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ac@@ re@@ centr@@ ations in subjects , irrespective of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid @-@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations prevail 10 mg / d@@ l About 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ E and F@@ act study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of about 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected in two years of open renewal study during Phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a pl@@ aster ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the pl@@ ump @-@ size , which in 54 % of the patients had a complete disappearance of the fangs until the month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also received in patients who were Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in a healthy test , the maximum plasma con@@ centric ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation period ( AU@@ C ) from feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration is easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses ranging from 120 mg and 300 mg for feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C is observed , the larger than the dos@@ is@@ dis@@ proportion is .
after in@@ gestion easier or multi @-@ pl@@ ers doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2.@@ 8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change has been observed in the percentage of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentration , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( v@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range of 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plas@@ tic eradic@@ ation of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent across the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

these findings are considered as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine @-@ condition and for clinical use as not relevant .
it has been found that Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in or@@ al doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day does not have an effect on the fertility and re@@ production capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , that for instance at 4.@@ 3@@ - times of human therapeutic exposure , maternal toxicity came up that accompanied with a reduction in output performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , in which the bones are bre@@ ached ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk for a small vitamin D mirror exists .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or remove other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid an irritation of the for@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separate in medicinal products that are approved in the European Union , the Company submitted data to date from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also led a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D &apos;s levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients treated with lower vitamin D mirror in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those that were exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also laid data on the fact that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age dose contained in the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE marked precisely the dose which is required to prevent loss of bone loss .
the most common side @-@ effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal he@@ ats ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system , flat@@ ul@@ ence , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( Ul@@ timo ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the Spe@@ aker , Dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie ( ra@@ gged abdom@@ en ) as well as su@@ cked up .
in patients with et@@ or@@ ative hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be applied .
it may not be used in disorders of o@@ es@@ op@@ a@@ emia management , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following notes are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swal@@ lowed up after the day one day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a exists . • The patients should not go before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tube except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , given only under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ er ( partly these severe and required a hospital request ) .
the doctor therefore ought to alert attention to all signs and symptoms that should point out on possible ös@@ s reaction such as Dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie , pain , pain , or retro@@ st@@ ale pain , or new or more lim@@ mer@@ ing so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and fetch medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients that will not take the medicine correctly and / or it after the appearance of symptoms that point to an ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all the teachings are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large , clinical studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk has been observed , often ( after the market launch ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reports ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ass of the j@@ aw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic c@@ ime contains mainly intraven@@ ously arranged bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the ab@@ sten@@ tion of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ ry in patients who require a ortho@@ don@@ tic intervention , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ass card of the j@@ aw .
clinical assessment by the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor is relevant for treatment planning for each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the patients should be reli@@ ant that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE once they have noticed their om@@ is@@ sions .
you should not take two tablets on the same day but taking the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ fication ) , should be treated before the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE as well .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , ant@@ acids , and some or@@ ale medicine can interfere with the remains of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age when they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait after taking al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interactions studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical trials were taken together with a multitude of usually prescribed medicines , without saying that clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used for pregnant women or breastfeeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age do not allow any indication of directly ashamed effects in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age on bone mass and frac@@ tion@@ aries of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies by identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ tion@@ - study ( FIT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the sei@@ zing of the BM@@ D of spine and Tro@@ han@@ ter continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ ards studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily will be taken either via 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily gift of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new spine to 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resistance related to a intraven@@ ous reference dose was the middle oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg for noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting and two hours before becoming a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
the bio@@ availability took accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ end@@ ron@@ at had taken one or half an hour before a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ tal , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy trials , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) is not a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age ( increase in the average range from 20 % to 44 % ) .

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a rep@@ ul@@ sion of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been deployed in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney planning , whereby the use of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indication of the effectiveness was the number of patients when the transp@@ l@@ ant was treated after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , for example , a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a res@@ ump@@ tion of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
furthermore , temporary further studies on 119 patients were carried out with kidney transp@@ l@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

patients and doctors have to be cautious when others ( particularly some herbal ) medicines should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f since the Adv@@ oc@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the same drug needs to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients should arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transp@@ l@@ ation fees or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ up@@ pression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the ré@@ g@@ ime should only be performed under the nar@@ rowed control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant physician ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding can be performed to make sure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ lic@@ ance and toler@@ ability in an individual case and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talent should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a talent level , with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and in le@@ ber@@ ized patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us rate levels are recommended during the first two weeks of transp@@ l@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure to immediate retro@@ transplan@@ ation phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the advent dose can take several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first post@@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml Con@@ centr@@ ate for producing an in@@ fusion solution ) is introduced with a dose of ca .
the duration of application Z@@ ur suppression of the transplan@@ tion , the immun@@ os@@ up@@ pression must therefore be maintained ; consequently , the maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation of the transplan@@ tion of the transplan@@ tion , The oral Adv@@ oc@@ tur@@ f therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dos@@ is@@ ations may be required later , as the Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics can change from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tion of transplan@@ tion The oral Adv@@ oc@@ tur@@ f therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendations - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted into a tran@@ gra@@ f capsules of twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this shift in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant After an adjustment of other imm@@ sup@@ press@@ ants at Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily needs treatment with the recommended oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tion .
heart transp@@ l@@ ant For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ent is an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily in the morning .
other transp@@ l@@ ant boo@@ sts although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pan@@ de@@ mic and o@@ den@@ um transplan@@ ted patients , with pan@@ de@@ mic initi@@ al@@ dose from 0,@@ 10 mg / kg / day and at gut transplan@@ tion in an or@@ al initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day for use .
dosage adap@@ tations in special patient @-@ groups patients with limited liver function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood cells in the targeted field can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions , a replacement of the dose may be required .
patients with reduced renal function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmaceuticals of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the renal function ( including a regular identification of the ser@@ ver@@ in@@ ine mirror , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ fer@@ ance and monitoring of the ureth@@ ra ) is recommended .
conversion from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f At the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the valley mirror in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ lic@@ ance and toler@@ ability in an individual case under the aid of full blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us decline levels checks .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us rate during the first two weeks of transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled according to conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or with the simultaneous application of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full @-@ blood concentration , ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the reflection in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml does not exceed .
in clinical practice the slow@@ down levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood lies in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in alignment - and warm transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent treatment of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ tion , generally blood @-@ concentration were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe unwanted events , including transplan@@ ations or other side @-@ effects which can occur in a row of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or super@@ fici@@ ency .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the ré@@ g@@ ime should only be performed under the nar@@ rowed control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transp@@ l@@ sion of transp@@ l@@ sion which proved to be proven compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
at the prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tion of adult heart@@ ening and transplan@@ tion in childhood , there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ b herb ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , or other plant healing during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ s - concentrations in the blood are offered because the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was a cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ ia described chamber or sep@@ t@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ ie that can therefore also occur in Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such sound@@ ing disorders are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver enzy@@ mes , infections , hydr@@ ation and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons by suitable clothing or use of solar protection by means of a high protection factor .
if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us take symptoms for Pr@@ es like head@@ ache , changing consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual disorders should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibit@@ ors or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended to super@@ v@@ ise the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels with the simultaneous casting of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentrations . ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) .

pharmaceutical studies suggest that the increase in blood levels mainly from the elevated bio @-@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the im@@ itation of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism , results .
high @-@ linear pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on as used in acute abor@@ tion actions can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII caused by con@@ genital blood @-@ compul@@ sive disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are depending on whether Adv@@ ent is used for the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack which causes blood pressure problems like bleeding in the joints , muscles , or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method which is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced into which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought into it , which it is applied to the formation of the human smell factor .
Adv@@ ate is a member of the European Union approved medicines called Re@@ ver@@ ate , but it is different , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was studied by the prevention of bleeding as well as surgical procedures .
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ enti@@ ls in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ ts with &quot; excellent &quot; and with &quot; good &quot; evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , headaches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
&apos;@@ Adv@@ ate must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human scent factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2004 the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG to approve authorization of Adv@@ ent in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment are based on the severity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical state of the patient .
in the following here@@ tical events the factor of VIII activity is not intended to sink into the corresponding plastic bar in the corresponding period of time ( in % of the standard or in that file / d@@ l ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) can be repeated for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk exceeds the patient .
during the treatment course , the control of the inj@@ ecting dose and the frequency of injections are an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma bricks .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 from factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the anticipated factor VIII plasma activities cannot be achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to prove a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions need to be weigh@@ ed .
the administration @-@ speed should be directed after the patient &apos;s payment , whereby a maximum injection of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutrality antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator@@ ical activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are produced in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , cor@@ relate with the scale of exposure to the factor VIII , whereas the risk depends on the first 20 extru@@ sion stage at the biggest and depend on genetic and other factors .
in patients @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 extru@@ sion and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ emergence of ( lowest ) in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences on the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) involved in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ ache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not well @-@ known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be appreciated ) .

based on the data available since the initial authorisation , the CH@@ MP has further evaluated the benefits of risk - weighing continues to be positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP did on the basis of the Security pro@@ fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the filing should apply for a further trial in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ o@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited , the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) officially approved that the company with@@ drawing its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breasts , the brain , the bones , or the past@@ ure parts ( tissues which connect other structures in the body , surrounds and base ) .
this is a type of virus that genetically modified , that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been changed so that there cannot be copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger any infection in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the can@@ cer@@ ous cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made of the non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body , p@@ 53 @-@ gene , contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and killing the cells if the DNA can not be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the can@@ cer@@ ous cells can continue to grow and share .
the company placed data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of the construction , into the bones and in the brain .
after CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company on the questions he asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on testing of initial documents the CH@@ MP takes up a list of 120 a list of questions sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for the patient brings .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not been sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; Com@@ es @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed action release &quot; means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective components immediately and the other is slowly being released over a few hours .
Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , by an allergy to pol@@ len caused by inflammation of the nose @-@ up ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ f@@ skin swelling ( pet@@ rol nose ) .
for adults and teenagers from 12 years onwards the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , above all the swelling of the nose @-@ endom@@ etri@@ um ( c@@ logged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be dimin@@ ished by the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main stress levels were the changes in the severity of the hay fever , which were reported by patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients received their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all hay fever , out of the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who captured Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patient , the pseudo @-@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al endom@@ etri@@ um was considered , the patients reported among the Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze a reli@@ eving of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26@@ ,@@ 7 % to the patient who captured Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ es ( cardiovascular ) , sei@@ z@@ oning , psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or@@ ic hyper@@ activity ( disorder , headaches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , sle@@ eves and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseudo @-@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or one of the other constitu@@ ents , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c substances or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( a different medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not used .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from a Eng@@ d@@ angle glau@@ coma ( ag@@ grav@@ ated water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral blood ) or have a risk for a stroke of stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to approve the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze of the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without breaking up or chew@@ ing ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the mis@@ understanding and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after lowering the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use of usage to 10 days because of long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can take over time .
by decreasing the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ as in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ x contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after termination of such treatment .
this is attributable to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors like Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , vom@@ iting , Di@@ hydro@@ po@@ ot@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ lep@@ hr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ els , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of these bin@@ ational therapy has not been checked for this patient collective and the data does not range from telling appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze have not been tested for patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data does not range from telling appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed about the treatment at the occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a tick populations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( like head@@ ache or contrac@@ tion of headaches ) must be deduc@@ ted .
when treating the following patient @-@ groups , patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a myo@@ cardi@@ ac attack in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is available at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological testing as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for bon@@ ding actions or reduce to their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plas@@ tic@@ ad@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or testing we could not find significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has been taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible Enzy@@ me has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ ic one .
the in@@ calcul@@ ability of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not backed up , experiences made from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , does not increase the frequency of abnorm@@ alities when compared to the frequency of the normal population .
because Re@@ production studies on animals can not always be transmitted to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tor@@ ical properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it that in very rare cases it can come to a ben@@ om@@ eness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of transportation or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary from a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular disease ) and a Z@@ NS @-@ stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ als .
head@@ ache , anxiety , complicated mi@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , coron@@ ation , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardi@@ ac , Tran@@ sm@@ al , nausea , vom@@ iting , coron@@ ary pain , t@@ aps , t@@ amp@@ ie , visual dys@@ functions and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a Z@@ NS @-@ stimulation is particularly probable in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pe@@ up@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , bon@@ ding , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro@@ j@@ or@@ ical cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhi@@ bitions of the expression of the adolesc@@ ence P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on endo@@ th@@ el@@ cells .
at a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes , including the strengthening of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks connected with flying .
controlled clinical trials was found during the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can generate additional person@@ able effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal .
it took 1,@@ 2@@ 48 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets received .
in both studies the hist@@ am@@ in@@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total cor@@ es for symptoms ( except nose @-@ skin swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ it over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the dropping effect , determined by the nose @-@ s@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
in the context of a single dose study to the Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
according to the per@@ or@@ ical application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze near healthy trials over 14 days the fly @-@ weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseudo @-@ ep@@ he@@ ad@@ ine is reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ specialist study , which has been carried out with the wording as tablet to healthy adult pro@@ ban@@ den , has been found that four Pro@@ ban@@ den des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is very rare .
a component inter@@ activity study reveals that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in , following the all@@ u@@ pro@@ hub of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , was in exposure to the gift of a aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .

January 2001 the European Commission granted the European Commission SP Europe for approval of the in@@ duction of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical studies for the effectiveness in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ en@@ tically allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be completed after lowering the symptoms ended and at their re @-@ occur will be res@@ umed .
in the pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during most allergy time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the powerful effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see below section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it that in very rare cases it can come to ben@@ om@@ eness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of transportation or the ability to use machines .
for clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo .
the most commonly reported side effects that reported more prevalent than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , oral ari@@ dity ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
during a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side @-@ effect headaches , these were treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ specialist study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ ly clinical dose ) have been administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro@@ str@@ ata cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the adolesc@@ ence P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ awareness , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage given up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ wer@@ fold of the clinical dose ) administered for ten days , does not show an extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
with a single dos@@ is@@ - study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement , including the strengthening of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks connected with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ cent secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear , and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ch on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into dependence on the duration of the symptoms , as well as in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the whole body of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ oc@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria has been studied for other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ge@@ ology irrespective of the e@@ ti@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chron@@ ically patients can become easier pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the history of history is a poll@@ uted factor in all ur@@ ic disorders , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in has also lead to improving symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the descent of Size and Number of Qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first Dos@@ is@@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who were not re@@ acted on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka who excluded from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sleep and wa@@ its , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s compared with 4 % of patients , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has been achieved .
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , this is not yet identified for the metabol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . however , this interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ ic one .
in a single dos@@ is@@ study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg of meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) does not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the preliminary trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in performed in a comparative degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on the conventional studies on security mat@@ ology , toxicity , toxicity and Re@@ production x@@ ic@@ ity , allow the prec@@ lin@@ ical data to be recognized with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in no particular haz@@ ards to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see below 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with ap@@ eri@@ us .
besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , in the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical studies and corresponding laboratory studies , should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is limited and experiencing a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is limited to metabo@@ li@@ ze , is identical to those in children that are normally metabo@@ li@@ zed .
this medicine includes Sac@@ char@@ osis and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with am@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as with the placebo group .
for clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ specialist study on adults and adolescents , who have been administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ ly clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can extr@@ apol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical trial with multi @-@ awareness in adults and juven@@ iles , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a d@@ osing of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ wer@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
controlled clinical trials was found during the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets conducted in adults and adolescents in clinical trials at no impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or .
in clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies on adults it came through the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced power imp@@ aired , nor to an increase in the sle@@ ep@@ iness .
with adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s were A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ cent secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ch on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the whole body of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ oc@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , As@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively become the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

June 2008 shared Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) officially stated that the company with@@ drawing its application for approval from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect flu , which is caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that could cause a strain of influenza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the grip virus emerges , which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the parts contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; body alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to form in contact with a flu @-@ virus this pedi@@ gree faster antibodies .
subsequently , the membrane ke@@ epers of the virus with the &quot; surface anti @-@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as body @-@ foreign ) separated and used as a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine should not be fulfilled in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vaccines .
if you are interested in a clinical examination and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for further information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , with the human@@ ic immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which is inf@@ lic@@ ated by the acquired immun@@ ic De@@ fici@@ ency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is indeed available as a solution to one , but this cannot be taken along with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral medicines of the patient before , and the probability suggested that the virus will respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces in case of in@@ gestion in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them on low levels .
AIDS do not cure AIDS but may delay the damage of the immune system and thus delay the development of AIDS related infections and illnesses .
A@@ gener@@ ase was evaluated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adult , which were previously not treated with eas@@ ing assignments .
this with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ gener@@ ase was compared to 20@@ 6 adults , which had formerly been reported by approval approval .
the main indication of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ al last ) or the change in virus burden after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously suffered no prot@@ eas@@ ants , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral burden below 400 copies / ml than under placebo but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the Vir@@ al burden , but with the children who previously had been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ers , very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ eas@@ antry that had been dealt with with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ al last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other protein inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was res@@ trained against four other prot@@ eas@@ ers , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral burden after four weeks as in the patients who carry out their hitherto approval approval :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( brass ) , vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ ne@@ avi@@ r or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
A@@ gener@@ ase is also not used in patients , the cur@@ b herb ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines , which are just as diverse as A@@ gener@@ ase and are detrimental to high concentrations in the blood health .
as with other medicines for HIV , in patients who are dis@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of le@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ass ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immune system syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fier , but the committee found that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously won no prot@@ eas@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since the approval was limited for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited for approval for the in@@ duction of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , Prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sts of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resili@@ ence and the patient treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % less than from Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sts ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ ne@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 400 mg Am@@ th@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants have not been studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data the dose to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to approximately 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver enzy@@ mes on 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and furthermore sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , contain the cur@@ b herb ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk reduction plastic and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ sc@@ are or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not cause a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
in general , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be applied along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy , have increased risk of severe liver interactions with potentially fatal course .
for the event of the simultaneous viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the relevant technical information of these drugs .
patients with pre @-@ existing limited liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ one or other glucose metabolism , that is not recommended over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids including murder and sup@@ compression of the renal function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin due to the increased risk of myo@@ path@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen is not recommended .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening unwanted side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standards for rati@@ o ) , are available methods for the determination of the drug con@@ centric .
in patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of decreased plastic bricks ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ mo@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ti@@ ghtening symptoms , especially if there is also low doses administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high Prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col@@ ge@@ content of the am@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the grinding are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ers , has reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an Ex@@ az@@ ure of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other illnesses , whose therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
ugly patients ( Type A and B ) , which have been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ers , are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous ha@@ em@@ omas and ha@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
with HIV infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective , at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory opportun@@ istic therapy ( ART ) to develop a inflammatory opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical states or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fact@@ orial Ä@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol intake , heavy immune , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ass , in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and furthermore sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with inf@@ erior width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given along with pharmaceuticals , whose active ingredients are mainly linked to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the increased plasma bar with severe and / or life @-@ threatening unwanted effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ ne@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a cervi@@ cal failure and to cause a relief development .
when trying to equi@@ p the plastic bar by a dosage increase of other protein inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects were observed at the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The serv@@ o mirror of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
when a patient takes already cur@@ is@@ k@@ we@@ ed , the am@@ in@@ der mirror is and , if possible to check the viral burden and dis@@ integrate the car@@ n@@ wort .
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ r avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increase , for C@@ max with 30 % reduced if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administered .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ anch@@ avi@@ r twice daily and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this treatment regim@@ en .
52 % limit when Am@@ di@@ vi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( plasma 2 mg twice daily ) reached with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a intake recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a very widespread monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this combination is not known .
there has been no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended due to the imagin@@ able component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the income of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) does not require a dosage adjustment .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ in@@ ox@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both protein inhibit@@ or would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ eas@@ ants and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the ser@@ um con@@ centric run of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r may possibly lowers .
if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din because of the decreased or possibly sub @-@ therapeutic plastic can be less effective .
if these medicines are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough prec@@ lin@@ ical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ ene led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin around 19@@ 3 % and thus increases the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic studies involving A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , however the plasma bar of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ ni@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the c@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 6@@ 9@@ fold in comparison with the value that has been observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly result in interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic responses , which are linked with these medicines if they are applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can come to resili@@ ence .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ ants known as an enzyme therapies known as enzyme phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r may lead to a humili@@ ation of plas@@ tic@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium compounds like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ di@@ pin , ri@@ pen@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ ne@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma @-@ concentration and ampli@@ fy with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual defects and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at @-@ plasma bar rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l rose by about 86 % of ag@@ ank ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous jail of A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ ghs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose inter@@ locking strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , have pronounced elev@@ ations of plasma bars at the same time of simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ pelines are not recommended for these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to myo@@ path@@ ia including one R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended using am@@ est@@ ra@@ viol@@ r .
it is recommended for frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zing the mirror , since Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the current gift of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be applied together with oral mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with equal use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other Prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plastic bar of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am on the 3@@ - up to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ mo@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ti@@ ghtening symptoms , especially if there is also low doses administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the very low reliability of historical ver@@ tices at present , no recommendation is given , such as the Am@@ mo@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adapted when Am@@ mo@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with current consumption of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International standard for rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ genic effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not pres@@ sible , therefore also alternative methods to contrac@@ eption methods are recommended .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the current consumption of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drug can only be applied during pregnancy only after careful deliber@@ ation of possible usage for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the milk @-@ activated rats , Am@@ mo@@ on@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ in@@ dem@@ avi@@ r comes to men into the mother &apos;s milk .
a Re@@ production study by pregnant rats , which was administered from the entry into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ pri@@ vi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight in the wake @-@ up .
the further development of the offspring including Fer@@ til@@ ism and Re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the symptoms associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up @-@ wise , occurred early on and rarely resulted in the treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are applied to HIV treatment or any other at the same time , or whether they are a result of atro@@ infection .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with Prot@@ eas@@ ants patients received un@@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which have been evaluated by the examination as in connection with the study media , and in more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as under the treatment of inf@@ erior laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy has been associated with HIV patients ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) with HIV sufferers , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ al and fast sub@@ skin tissue , multip@@ ly abdom@@ inal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ hic body fat collection ( Sti@@ ern@@ els ) .

in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 joined patients under Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ass were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy ( ART ) .
with HIV infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective , at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory opportun@@ istic therapy ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .

the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm for acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µm for chronic infected cells
the link between the activity of Am@@ pri@@ vi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ ed patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages were - as with other chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ st@@ alled treatment regim@@ en with prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .

a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure within the 59 included , with prot@@ eas@@ ants un@@ treated patients did not appear in patients , showed resp@@ ectiv@@ ity that were similar to those in adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) to the patients treated in patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure over 96 weeks , the following protein breakdown mut@@ ations :
on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resili@@ ence based analyses gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be applied to the assessment of the activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r / k@@ 50@@ V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a decreased probability of cervi@@ cal response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations for analysis of the results of relief tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ical resili@@ ent analysis based analy@@ tically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the assessment of the activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ed approval @-@ resistant insulation .
companies , the diagnostic tests exp@@ ired , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ Phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a result tests .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity against am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cru@@ ising resistance against k@@ din@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ ne@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ di@@ avi@@ r Res@@ ett@@ lement , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five @-@ reviewed patients , with which an Fos@@ am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ulates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ mo@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ants resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early abor@@ ting treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect the following treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ op@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ fle@@ dged chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven HIV @-@ sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ risk of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI @-@ group with regard to the age @-@ up dec@@ imal number ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ pin wave of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ re@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in studies A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was not given a low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s combined with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the included patients received a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 basics of this data should be considered at the treatment optimization with PI pre @-@ treated children of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generative &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increase , for C@@ max with 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered together with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ mo@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake of the scale and rate of the resili@@ ent remained .
the seem@@ less distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be reduced to a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ even penetration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , whereby the amount of im@@ measur@@ em am@@ anch@@ avi@@ r which represents the active share is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ brid@@ led Am@@ mo@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dose of course in dependence on the total doctor &apos;s off@@ ence in ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines must indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhibit@@ ors or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be given with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ in@@ der @-@ exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney function is likely to be minor to the elimination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment regim@@ ens lead to am@@ in@@ ox@@ avi@@ r plastic mas@@ pi@@ ers comparable to those that are scored in healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ th@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ cer@@ o@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity on mice and rats appear with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ ome with dos@@ ages ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , to twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ ne@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ oli@@ o@@ cular aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , there were little evidence of adopting a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ genome tests , the bacterial mut@@ ation tests , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ c@@ ern@@ test on rats and chromos@@ omes , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r was not mut@@ o@@ ox@@ ic or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver toxicity can be observed and detected in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ us .
previously , in clinical studies , no significant liver toxicity has been observed in patients , neither during administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor by the end of treatment .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which have been treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mor@@ t@@ ality both with the check@@ box and in those with Am@@ mo@@ vi@@ r @-@ treated animals .
during a systemic Plas@@ ma@@ Ex@@ pos@@ ure that was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeu@@ tical dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes include Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ eton changes , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the growing addition of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sts ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ ne@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 400 mg Am@@ th@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is intended to be diagnosed in patients with vigil@@ ant or lighter liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening unwanted side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standards for rati@@ o ) , are available methods for the determination of the drug con@@ centric .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set at duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the grinding are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a pro@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ ne@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a cervi@@ cal failure and to cause a relief development .
5@@ 08 % increase , for C@@ max with 30 % reduced if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( plasma 2 mg twice daily ) reached with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a intake recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a very widespread monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ in@@ ox@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both protein inhibit@@ or would be low .
if these medicines are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough prec@@ lin@@ ical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium compounds like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ di@@ pin , ri@@ pen@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ ne@@ avi@@ r , causing the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at @-@ plasma bar rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l rose by about 86 % of ag@@ ank ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with current consumption of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International standard for rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ genic effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of E@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drug can only be applied during pregnancy only after careful deliber@@ ation of possible usage for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a re@@ production study by pregnant rats , which was administered from the entry into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ pri@@ vi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the body weight of the wake @-@ up .
the un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe the signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supportive policies are required .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as the peri@@ pher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ est@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm for acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µm for chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ mo@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ants resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data should be considered at the treatment optim@@ isation with PI pre @-@ treated children , which are expected to be expected by &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; ast@@ re@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ brid@@ led Am@@ mo@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dose of course in dependence on the total doctor &apos;s off@@ ence in ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines must indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhibit@@ ors or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be given with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
also the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney function is likely to be minor to the elimination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ cer@@ o@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity on mice and rats appear with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ ome with dos@@ ages ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ ne@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ative aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on the human being , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , few hints for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ genome tests , the bacterial mut@@ ation testing ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , micro@@ ca@@ tho@@ cy@@ tes to human peri@@ pher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ in@@ ox@@ avi@@ r was not mut@@ o@@ ox@@ ic or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which have been treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mor@@ t@@ ality both with the check@@ box and in those with Am@@ mo@@ vi@@ r @-@ treated animals .
these results can be concluded that in juven@@ iles are not fully mature in juven@@ iles , so Am@@ mo@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution to use is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , Prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of using k@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ation was neither assigned to PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % less than from Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should be as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , with taking the solution to pick up ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ ne@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg of am@@ est@@ ra@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .

the application ff@@ ness and the duration of treatment with al@@ dara depend on the treatment of treatment : • In case of cow@@ ardi@@ ce during the genital area Al@@ dara is holding up to a maximum of 16 weeks a week . • In case of small bas@@ ins cycles , it is possible during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is before bed@@ time fertili@@ zers to spread on the affected skin areas so that they remain sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away .
in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredients ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies to 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indication of the efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete lowering of the treated warnings . • Al@@ dara was also studied at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ kets in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or the placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indication of the efficacy was the number of patients with full ab@@ out@@ age of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in genital area , the total reduction rate amoun@@ ted from 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dara patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .

local skin actions are frequent , but the intensity of this reactions takes effect generally during therapy or the reactions form after completing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cre@@ am .
if it is necessary because of the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local skin actions it may be made a treatment break of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the skin treated approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
since there are no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , however , other suitable therapy forms should be considered .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the application is not recommended in previously @-@ treated tum@@ ours .

the available data about acute ker@@ at@@ mos@@ ses on the under@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application . therefore , such application is not recommended .
local skin actions often arise , but these reactions take usually in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cre@@ am .
if the local skin actions can cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for several days .
data from an open clinical trial is that patients with more than 8 acts have been shown to be less than 8 lesi@@ ons , than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme therapy in patients with verified diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves in connection ) .
this means certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kane , G@@ ags ) will not be disman@@ tled and can thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and these damage .
the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements difficult , dimin@@ ishing pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , cardi@@ ac and Au@@ re@@ generative diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vis@@ ing equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent any allergic reaction .

in the study the safety of the drug was investigated , however , it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by investig@@ ating its effect in terms of reducing the ag concentrations in urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the ag @-@ concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children reported a normal large liver by the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , abdom@@ inal pain , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ ia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion point .
very common side @-@ effects for patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen sti@@ cking ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ es ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may possibly react greatly in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , cannot be used .
the European Drug Research Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review every year all new information that may be known to review and update this summary required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will watch patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 the European Commission shared Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for approval of the in@@ duction of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell@@ en ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ oom of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to treat patients with verified diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h may , if the patient does not tolerate this , every 15 minutes will be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended as a d@@ osing scheme .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended as a d@@ osing scheme .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients may develop in@@ fusion reaction that occurs during in@@ fusion or by the end of the in@@ fusion ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be eng@@ ul@@ ously monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , in which re@@ development equipment for medical emergen@@ cies should be available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , virtually all patients Ig@@ G antibodies form against larv@@ ae are usually within 3 months from treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
given little experience regarding the res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer break , it must be cautious according to the theoretical risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction after a break of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ sep@@ tic ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion reactions .
in the case of an easy or medium @-@ sized in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ in@@ ox@@ es / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction performed .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be hal@@ ted until the symptoms are brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ in@@ ic / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering .
in@@ fusion can be recorded with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , where the reaction performed has been res@@ umed .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ in@@ ic / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction performed has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular inclusion of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect impact on pregnancy that include embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated against larv@@ ae over the mother &apos;s milk is recommended , is not recommended during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me not to satisfy .
the side @-@ effects in clinical trials were ordered mainly as in@@ fusion reaction that have been observed at 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted pharmaceutical actions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3@@ - study and its extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper air@@ ways and lungs in the pre @-@ history , there were heavy reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , respiratory and facial skin ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
children in@@ experienced drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with mainly heavy exp@@ ir@@ ation form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients came to a ser@@ o version within 3 months after the start of treatment at a ser@@ o version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
by the end of phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients no use on radio@@ immun@@ op@@ s@@ zip@@ pers ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say veri@@ fiable antibodies before , including 3 patients in which it was never released to serv@@ o version .
patients with lack of lower antibodies to a robust reduction in the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies , was an variable reduction in G@@ ag in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal up to a low neutral inhibit@@ or effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing g@@ ag in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence unwanted drug actions even if the occurrence of adverse drug actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and cells into the ly@@ os@@ omes , most likely about man @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ orous recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ e@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study the total disease spectrum was the majority of patients from the Middle @-@ phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atorial volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change in the amount of FE@@ V and the absolute en@@ closures in the 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ - salary .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where she received for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients across the placebo group to improve the lung function and en@@ closures that are shown in the following table .
when open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage @-@ percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period of clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung @-@ volume increases constantly propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of 26 patients with a Hep@@ atomic eg@@ alie treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear trash of the g@@ ag @-@ mir@@ rors in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) determined that remained constant until the degree of study .
regarding the hetero@@ genic disease symptoms between patients , which has been considered through use of a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes in cross @-@ length parameters ( to be expected in 6 minutes walking distance , movement area of the shoulder @-@ yellow AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it was conducted an open @-@ year open phase @-@ 2 study where mainly the safety and pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics was studied by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at 20 patients who were at the time of taking into the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the heavy rotation form and 4 with the middle water form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to increased GA@@ G@@ - mir@@ rors in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) determined after the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the moderate increase form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , whereas the older patients were able to determine only limited amount of progress in cognitive development .
in a Phase 4 study tests carried out to pharmac@@ ological effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms d@@ osing regim@@ ens on the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the d@@ osing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficiency of these two d@@ osing regim@@ ens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to older and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( a different medicine against cancer ) in patients who have still no chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) , and the mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the epith@@ eli@@ um cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who previously had not been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens used previously .
to decrease side effects , patients should take during treatment with a@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and get injections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should before or after the Gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin , in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to avoid fluid lack of fluid ) .
in patients whose blood picture changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postponed , or the dose may be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ es slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes more easily than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug , and a longer duration of cancer in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms A@@ lim@@ ta in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy effects by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived at an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in all@@ u@@ ing administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients in which cancer does not attack the epith@@ eli@@ um cells , for administration of a@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the comparative medicine .
September 2004 the European Commission granted the company El@@ i Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the ab@@ outs of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each liquid bottle has to be raised with 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % N@@ atri@@ um@@ ch@@ lori@@ de injection resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - S@@ IS will be taken from diar@@ rhe@@ a bottle and be dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % N@@ atri@@ um@@ ch@@ lori@@ de injection resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .

AL@@ IM@@ TA in mono@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in a second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except excessive moisture @-@ epith@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours for approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² COM administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and severity of Hau@@ tre@@ ads must be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ xed gases and on the day following treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses must be taken fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy season as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also obtain an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) within the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third step @-@ cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created before each Gift , a full blood picture , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ lic en@@ umer@@ ation .
the al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper border value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a Dos@@ age must take place under Ber@@ ück@@ ing of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ ic@@ ity of the prescribed treatment regim@@ ens .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) The C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological toxicity from Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s value before treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be broken when in patients following 2 dos@@ is@@ reduc@@ tive toxicity or non @-@ ha@@ mat@@ ologic toxicity or so@@ - continue with the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 patients or compared to patients aged under the age of 65 has increased risk @-@ risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data for un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical trials were necessary for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of about 45 ml / min no dosage adap@@ tations necessary , which are recommended for all patients recommended Dos@@ is@@ ations .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance from below 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
however patients were examined with a liver function@@ alities of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border @-@ value and / or Trans@@ am@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; 3.@@ 0 @-@ fold the upper border value ( near liver sampling ) or &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ fold the upper border value ( for presence of liver testing ) not specifically studied in studies .
patients must be supervised with regard to Kno@@ - chen@@ mark@@ ers and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutral number has a value of about 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic number has once again achieved a value of over 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutral number , Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity , as they have been observed in previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ ro@@ pen@@ cils , such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , feb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie has been vali@@ dated when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients need to be reli@@ ant with p@@ em@@ et@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as prophy@@ l@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must be the simultaneous intake of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ vary ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ els ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ posit@@ ories , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s must be avoided with a long semi @-@ term for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ els ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occur , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid waste collection in the trans@@ cellular room a dra@@ inage of the co@@ ding before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment can be weigh@@ ed .
5 serious cardiovascular abnorm@@ alities , including myo@@ cardi@@ ac disease , and de@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ els occasionally , when this substance was usually administered in combination with any other cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application is not recommended ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is possible , men should be advised before the treatment - g@@ inn to obtain advice on sperm production .

since no data is available with regard to interaction with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , with a long @-@ term such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ ycle , the simultaneous application must be avoided with p@@ em@@ et@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual variation of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International standards for rati@@ o ) if the decision was made to treat the patient - ducks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ pu@@ ren An@@ tim@@ esc@@ ol@@ ites are expected in an application during pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if strictly necessary and according to thorough examination of the user for the mother and risk to the fet@@ us ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
as the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ posit@@ ories , men should be advised before the treatment course in order to obtain advice on sperm @-@ preserv@@ atives .

the primary analysis of this study was made in the population of all patients carried out in the treatment arm the test medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om has been shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the all@@ u@@ c@@ is@@ tin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .

in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of about 28 kg / m2 , patients who took 3@@ i 60 mg , after one year reported an average weight loss of 4,@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study involving All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patient &apos;s most relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are ö@@ stain@@ ed spots at after , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ de ) with Stu@@ h@@ lab@@ s , Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ st , fet@@ ched / o@@ dd@@ ling chair , Flat@@ no@@ ence ( Win@@ de ) and soft chairs .

alli is for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I = 28 kg / m2 ) contra@@ indicated and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical , fet@@ al nutrition .
alli must not be used by children and young people under 18 because not sufficient data is available for effectiveness and safety .
since Or@@ list@@ ate is only minimal resor@@ ted , is not necessary for elders and in patients with reduced liver or kidney function , no adaptation of the dosage .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredients or one of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chron@@ ic@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase when alli is taken along with a gre@@ ase @-@ rich and low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy involving alli made a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tics must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who are alli , as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ists if the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures , in order to prevent the prevention of oral contrac@@ eption in the event of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ dependen@@ cies of drugs as well as in several cases with the simultaneous application of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a lowering of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plastic bar .
in the application of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ ate , the Quick values ( internationally norm@@ aly rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who have been treated with Or@@ list@@ ate in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as of the beta car@@ rots in the standard range .
however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time to take a supplement of the Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure an adequate intake of vitamin ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
after the gift of a sub@@ du@@ d@@ osis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed at a limited number of healthy volunteers at the same time , a minor withdrawal of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation .
the experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and are bound together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects were obtained from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not well @-@ known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be appreciated ) .
the frequency of well @-@ known side effects that have been established after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events are voluntarily reported by a population of in@@ certain size .
mini It is plau@@ si@@ bly that treatment with alli made into anxiety with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects can lead .
single @-@ users of 800 mg of Or@@ list@@ ate and multi @-@ professional subjects of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings occurred .
in the majority of cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side @-@ effects were reported as at the recommended dose by Or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , it can be trac@@ ed from a fast re@@ formation of systemic effects that can be trac@@ ted to the correspon@@ dent qualities of Or@@ list@@ ate .
the therapeutic effect puts in the lum@@ ens of the ma@@ gens and the upper intest@@ ine perme@@ ation by co@@ eli@@ al bond to the active Ser@@ mon @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and pan@@ acea Li@@ passive .
clinical trials derived from clinical studies that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ ate was taken three times a day , absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ us .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled trials of adults with a BM@@ I 7,@@ 28 kg / m2 take the effectiveness of 60 mg total , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ tered diet .
the primary parameter , the change of the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the degree course ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those studies that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was equivalent to 60 mg -@@ 2,@@ 4 % ( cur@@ b 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2,@@ 8 % ( total value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols was with Or@@ list@@ ate 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3,@@ 8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the wa@@ ist size the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ ate 60 mg ( starting at 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( output worth 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of non @-@ metabo@@ li@@ zed Or@@ list@@ at were not measurable for 8 hours following the oral casting of 360 mg of Or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .

the most common side effects are connected with the effect of the capsules and thus arise that increased fat from the body is eliminated .
these side effects tend to occur within the first weeks after treatment starts , since at this time the fat content in the diet may have not yet been significantly reduced .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional supplements : • Start one week before taking the capsules with a fatty nutrition . • learning more about the usual fat content your favourite dish and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you can exceed your fat limit . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fats even@@ ly on the daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , do not apply to them in the form of a gre@@ ase trial or a entertaining post @-@ reduction procedure , as you possibly occur in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these companions appear to control these with time due to adapting their diets .
• Use medicines for children to be in@@ accessible . • You may not apply no more than 25 ° C . • The bag is closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silic@@ on gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

Alo@@ xi is used for chemotherapy regim@@ ens to break the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy regim@@ ens , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ y@@ tic ) .
the use of patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group have not been published enough information .
this means that the active substance prevents the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to prevent the recept@@ ors in the gut .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , which received chemotherapy regim@@ ens who are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
for chemotherapy regim@@ ens , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are showed 59 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
for chemotherapy regim@@ ens , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients were treated with alo@@ xi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
when compared with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission shared Helsinki on Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the ab@@ outs of Alo@@ xi in the whole of the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indic@@ ative : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding a particular cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
since Pal@@ on@@ otic tron may extend the col@@ dar@@ mp@@ le age , patients should be supervised with an@@ am@@ nesty arrangement or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable to extend the current purchase of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension .
apart from connection with another chemotherapy agents , Alo@@ xi in the days following chemotherapy did not be used to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron inhi@@ bits the tum@@ ours of the five investig@@ ational chemotherapy agents not ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ c@@ abling , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical trial , there were no significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ otic tron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ s concentration of a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
in a population based upon a population based pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous casting of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors , C@@ elec@@ e@@ ti@@ ine , Hal@@ ox@@ etine , par@@ ox@@ in , k@@ ox@@ in , k@@ ini@@ dine , k@@ ox@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron .
experiences to use Pal@@ on@@ otic tron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies do not lie , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is considered to be necessary by the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were related to Alo@@ xi in connection with headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of transi@@ tions and reactions of the administration ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were stated in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest d@@ osing showed similar frequencies of undes@@ irable events as in the other me@@ tering groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relations to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , because of the great distribution of distribution , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy in a alo@@ ology - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind@@ ed studies were received a total of 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , &lt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , and 1,@@ 25 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) received , that was given to day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ otic tron , received with patients who were 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron that were given to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ ar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical studies for indicator @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ otic tron on blood pressure , heart rate and e@@ KG parameters including the respective effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on were comparable .
according to the findings of clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron possesses the ability to block the ion@@ als and re@@ pol@@ arization of the ion@@ als and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy test results was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ V administered Pal@@ on@@ otic tron in single d@@ osis of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gases follows a initi@@ ale decrease of the plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations a slow elimination of the body with average termin@@ alen half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma con@@ centric ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration period ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally observed in the whole tin range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ / kg in gest@@ ures and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , between day 1 and day 5 were measured average ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ otic tron Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that at once a daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , with which after single intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ max after the reproduction of 0,@@ 75 mg was higher .
approximately 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys , and some other 50 % will be converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ism , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron is less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ alli@@ zation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ is E@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 is involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ otic tron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron as an un@@ changing active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous stu@@ ff@@ tion in gest@@ ds , the total body was between 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while in patients with severe liver supplements , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron is increased , but a reduction in the dose is thus not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials effects , effects were observed only according to ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 from prec@@ lin@@ ical studies suggest that Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can only block in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ers , who are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and leng@@ then the action @-@ potential .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ otic tron ( any dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) that were given daily for two years led to a multip@@ ly frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine , pancre@@ atic , pancre@@ atic , pancre@@ atic and tum@@ ours in rats , but not with mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but because of the used high dos@@ ages and da Alo@@ xi when humans are used for unique use , the relevance of these results is low valued as humans .

in June 2006 the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the authorisation of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C and from Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Alp@@ he@@ on a biological drugs called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should resem@@ ble the same therapeutic component already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference ti@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ prolonged ) hepatitis C ( one by a viral infection ) .

it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to which this is stimulating to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on presented data , showing the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the pharmaceutical , drug , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared with the effectiveness of the reference practitioner via 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study was measured how many patients after 12 out of total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment on the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood was recorded ) .

furthermore , concerns were vo@@ iced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug is not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on fl@@ amm@@ ates the disease in more patients than with the reference supplement ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
aside from that , the test has been resolved in the study to determine the extent the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ te ( one with cr@@ ust @-@ going skin infection ) and small in@@ infected Laz@@ z@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or cutting @-@ f@@ aded ) , sha@@ kes and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven to be proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not affect these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should re @-@ examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial strap ( the parts of the bacterial cells that are produced in which proteins are produced ) and thus inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indication of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was withdrawn after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to treatment .
in the treatment of infected c@@ tw@@ ines , Al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar contact : if the results of both studies were gathered at home networks , about 90 % of the patients of both groups fell to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was observed in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( eit@@ er@@ ous cav@@ ity in the body tissue ) or by infections caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the common@@ est side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation to the contractor .
the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) got to the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go during the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ary , se@@ aling , or se@@ wn wounds .
may 2007 the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go into the entire European Union .
patients in which no improvement could be taken within two to three days are to be considered once and an alternative treatment should be considered ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in case of raising awareness or heavy local irritation through the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine the treatment is broken down , the sal@@ ine carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection will be started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary wounds , the effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant st@@ ack@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were caused , insufficient .
an alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or a deterioration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the small plasma con@@ centric , that have been achieved with humans to topical skin on poor skin or infected superficial wounds , is a clin@@ ically relevant im@@ itation in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous onset of 2 times per day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be to the needy skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not required if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ic@@ ity after or@@ ic intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the federal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a topical anti@@ bacterial treatment is clear and the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin for the gift of a systemic antibiotic treatment is preferred .
in deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / ends or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be terminated , is between the benefit of breastfeeding for inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most frequently reported side @-@ effect ir@@ irritation in the administration of approximately 1 % of the patients concerned .
active Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is treated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ ery anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ or of the bacterial protein synthesis , due to interaction at a particular bon@@ ding of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial reef , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the Bind@@ ing Bo@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P connector and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ ez@@ anne .
by loyalty to this ties , Ple@@ as@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking partial P @-@ ties interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
should be focused on the basis of local pre@@ val@@ ence to the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin for at least some infection forms , a consultation should be pursued by experts .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ aur@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in the case of non @-@ appeal to the treatment in S.@@ aur@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .

Ambi@@ rix is applied to the protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not im@@ partial against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used within a framework of two doses , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason Ambi@@ rix is allowed to only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccination plan comes to an end from two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine can be given .
vaccines have to act by bringing them to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it can be opposed to a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 .
the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same illnesses , but Twin@@ SAFE adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered from three doses to existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that uses the application of Twin@@ rix adults are also used as test@@ ament to the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indication of the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of antibodies to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the level of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar at a six @-@ month intervals between the injections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain on the injection , redness , mat@@ ures ( fatigue ) as well as friction .
Ambi@@ rix may not respond to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission shared Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a permit for the induc@@ ing of Ambi@@ rix throughout the
the standardization plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her chim@@ ney is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the vacc@@ inated vaccines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding months .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immune to have addressed to a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , a refres@@ her chim@@ ney as a protection , since they are also protected in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies because of immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all injections should be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and supervision may always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ f@@ sch@@ ema is recommended using the composite sub@@ strate , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ incompatible hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ B surface .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , after the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation , is achieved under certain circumstances no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ inations can be required .
since a intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could result in the glut@@ eal muscle to a subtle implications , these injections should be avoided .
however , in Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ ia or blood @-@ minded disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected out in sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift of bleeding .
if ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ ous , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular pol@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined species of m@@ umps , the immune response was given to all anti@@ gens sufficiently ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective needs to be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this wording in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ures , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in earlier Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative vaccine @-@ containing vaccine .
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ load regul@@ arity .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ eness on a calculation basis per vaccination basis Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the test , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ load regul@@ arity .
after the complete ino@@ fec@@ ycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the test , the Ambi@@ rix had received , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects , which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ - com@@ mu@@ zzle .
however , the frequency of mat@@ eness was comparable to a pro@@ verb ( i.e. , over the entire vaccine @-@ cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the test , the Ambi@@ rix received , compared with 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the subjects that received the 3 @-@ load regul@@ ator ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ eness was low and comparable that was observed after administration of the compromise with the 3 @-@ load vaccine .
in a comparative study with 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of loc@@ ating actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that which was form@@ ative in administration with the 3 @-@ load regul@@ ative hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ B surface .
with the 6@@ - to 11@@ am s , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent appearance of pain ( on the inj@@ ecting location ) per dose , not per ad@@ mill .
the percentage of vacc@@ inations that reported about severe side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ load vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ load vaccine with the combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ B@@ - surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials , which were conducted at vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - until 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ant with three doses .
with 2@@ 89 people whose immuno@@ ass@@ ures had been le@@ ad@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ting rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of 3 @-@ can @-@ im@@ material was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study during 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ year after completion of the full vacc@@ inations ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ load vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ load vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ B surface .
for persons who were at the time of pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ation between 12 and 15 years old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be demonstrated over at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable with that , after vaccination of 3 cans with a compromise , made up of 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis @-@ B surface finishes in a tin volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be demonstrated that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies comparable to 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vaccine .

the hepatitis @-@ A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in water @-@ waters de@@ filed waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ ond face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines ambi@@ rix can not be fully protected from infection with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus , although the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 cans .
if you / your child is infected with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or hepatitis @-@ B virus infected with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or hepatitis @-@ B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick , vaccination may possibly not prevent disease vaccine .
a protection against other infections that are causing the liver or symptoms similar to those such as hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or Hepatitis B infection can not be conve@@ yed .
• If your child already has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ ling skin r@@ ashes , respiratory not , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has previously performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • if you have a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually designated administration of the second vaccination ) .
with a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased salary to effective components each vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ B surface area ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with decreased content to effective components is usually administered a month after the initial dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection before ending the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disorder or treatment in your / his body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child will undergo a hem@@ aly@@ sis / object .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response to these individuals on vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 sa@@ ils to your doctor if you / your child have to take additional medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated and has been given or immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) has been given or has been planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient to the vaccine and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given with Ambi@@ rix at the same time , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties .
if ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breastfeeding women is not administered but it is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about specific other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .
very common ( more than 1 case per 10 ver@@ im@@ ent doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the in@@ sti@@ ch@@ point or redness • Mat@@ iness • irritation • irritation • headaches • loss of appetite

ambient temperature is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the In@@ tro@@ duction , the CH@@ MP opinion that the risk @-@ risk for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix starts only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data are limited to this medicine because of low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ e@@ tic En@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain injury following high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ compli@@ ations ) in pre @-@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is distributed - split into several single d@@ ots with meals - swal@@ lowed , among the food mixed or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also ( through the abdom@@ en into the stomach leading ) or a no@@ stri@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach leading ) administered .
it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ gers could not be compared to any other treatment or placebo ( a hypo@@ medication that could be compared without the substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also cause loss of appetite in blood , depression , stimul@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ability , vom@@ iting , flavors or taste conversion , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , rash , uncomfortable body odor , or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) got to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps is effectively prevented in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high am@@ moni@@ tions .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was registered under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine .
the use is contra@@ indicated in all patients when a complete enzyme is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ modular form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which is manifested after the first life months ) there is an indicator of the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ da@@ c En@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with ra@@ im@@ balances , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually comp@@ uted in consideration of protein @-@ tolerant and the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ ac phosph@@ or syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ ous in@@ at@@ ase lack must ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with ra@@ im@@ balances as a risk for the emergence of o@@ sop@@ ho@@ gan@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets are not immediately able to enter into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ but@@ t , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ tention , and o@@ de@@ formation of clinical states only with caution .
da met@@ alli@@ zation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium poly@@ but@@ t via the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the significance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is thus contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous gases of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young r@@ att@@ as in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of ne@@ ural tube and to a hei@@ ghtened loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a hes@@ it@@ ant matur@@ ation of distor@@ r@@ ales syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of working nerve agents in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is left in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during lac@@ tation is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients employed at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) , and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old par@@ anor@@ mal patio , which developed an metabolic En@@ cephal@@ ia in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ ac@@ outlet , he@@ y@@ y@@ top@@ ia , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred during a 5 @-@ month @-@ child @-@ child with a acci@@ dentally single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms enter with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an metabolic active compound that is handled by acet@@ yl@@ ate with glut@@ amine in phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is divor@@ ced across the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etric is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for every gram , N@@ atri@@ al phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ rogen are produced .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is placed early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival prognosis and the clinical outcome .
the prognosis of the early @-@ mani@@ fac@@ tual form of disease with appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was early almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease carried out even in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their stu@@ ffed free an@@ alo@@ ga within the first year of life .
by modi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen secre@@ tion ( sodium and sodium poly@@ phen@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ t , sodium and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of rest@@ less in post @-@ part@@ al ( however , within the first life months ) , diagnosed with 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and were treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ed En@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it was time with many spiritual disabilities or other neurological deficits .
in patients with a late @-@ tight shape of the condition ( including feminine patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of or@@ ni@@ in@@ trans@@ car@@ b@@ oul@@ try @-@ deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ e@@ tic En@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ or and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the surplus @-@ rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and some patients may occur further deterioration of the neurological condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ stru@@ ed in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and of his metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were made according to gift of a single dose of 5 g N@@ atri@@ um phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in so@@ ber metabolism and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of reproduction as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of or@@ al doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and his metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gases ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an or@@ al single dose of 5 g N@@ atri@@ al phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after in@@ gestion Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations by Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ureth@@ ane dys@@ functions or h@@ emo@@ glo@@ be@@ opath@@ ies ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after consuming no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single d@@ ants ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma was higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is divor@@ ced within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ stly product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , N@@ atri@@ um phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no en@@ cla@@ genic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either oral ( infants and children who have not swal@@ low tablets , or patients with ra@@ im@@ balances ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ a .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serv@@ o proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ ac phosph@@ or syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram N@@ atri@@ al phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ but@@ t , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes were exposed in front of the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ ite by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid @-@ cells of the brain .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old par@@ anor@@ mal patio , which developed an metabolic En@@ cephal@@ ia in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ ac@@ outlet , he@@ y@@ y@@ top@@ ia , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etric is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion from excess
on the basis of investigations on ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gram , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl but@@ yl between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ rogen .
already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment , and in some patients there may occur further deterioration of the neurological condition .
after an or@@ al single dose of 5 g N@@ atri@@ ster@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were determined 15 minutes after in@@ gestion Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations by Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
while the duration of the shelf life , the patient can retain the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
this procedure includes the small measuring spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g N@@ atri@@ al phen@@ yl but@@ at .
if a patient has to obtain the medication above a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium poly@@ but@@ yl is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzy@@ mes are missing , so they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ ck@@ les @-@ containing waste products which can accum@@ ulate according to the intake of proteins in the body .
if you are conducted with laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you are AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since N@@ atri@@ um phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the lac@@ tation you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since the drug could pass over to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases also confusion , headaches , taste disorders , indul@@ gence of o@@ bedience , still@@ ness , still@@ ness and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ log@@ istic states were observed .
if you find one of these symptoms in you , sit immediately with your doctor or using the intake of your medical hospital for the purpose of treating a corresponding treatment .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or myo@@ car@@ ess attack ( cardi@@ an@@ case ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement of electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help with patients with Ang@@ ina or coron@@ ary heart to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at all gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ ate @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I ) compared with conventional compression treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
during the PCI , patients often became a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a delay ) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the Gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , coron@@ ary cases or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who undergo a PCI , an@@ gi@@ ox regarding all indicators was just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other deer or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
it may also not be applied in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as men with heavy high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a cardi@@ ac infection .
the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) got to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 shared the European Commission of The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for the in@@ duction of an@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ able Ang@@ ina / non @-@ le@@ verage attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in an emergency stop or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous stu@@ n of 0,@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another result , an additional bol@@ us should be increased from 0,5 mg / kg and in@@ fusion for the duration of the operation to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h increases .
after PCI @-@ requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a shaft of 0,5 mg / kg administered is followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ op@@ last@@ y .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous stu@@ ff@@ ing of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us @-@ Gift of An@@ gi@@ ox is not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , should be a second bol@@ ster of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and administered rapidly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , further supervision is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in case of patients with moderate kidney control ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that can be subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower In@@ fusion rate should be used by 1,4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value is on 225 seconds , a second stu@@ d@@ dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again .
in patients with moderate kidney study , which was included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) that led to approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the Gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us with no dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is contra@@ indicated ( see below 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous yeast or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous bells of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredients or an other constitu@@ ents or against deer • active bleeding or increased blood stress disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ ver@@ ge bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • he@@ avier kidney damage ( FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are prescribed during treatment carefully in terms of symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine occur the most bleeding in arter@@ ial point of points , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment generally occur everywhere bleeding .
in patients who are war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , the monitoring of the IN@@ R factory ( International Standards of rati@@ o ) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din was once again reached before the treatment of existing level .
depar@@ ting from the knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tika or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic Engine ) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the blood pressure .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic agents or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological h@@ emo@@ st@@ as@@ e@@ parameters in any case regularly control .
the following experimental tests are inadequate in terms of impact on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the removal or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ questionable army par@@ ine or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group as well as in patients with he@@ par@@ in @-@ treated compar@@ isons , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than for male or younger patients .
heavy bleeding have been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and TI@@ MI standards for heavy bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone less often than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ Dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ational blood or bleeding required , hem@@ at@@ ological or surgical intervention required , reduction of the hem@@ mo@@ ck@@ bell mirror of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with well @-@ known blood @-@ point , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
more , less frequently watched blood @-@ loc@@ alis@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , &quot; other &quot; scores , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ ar , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at 6000 patients who undergo a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group as well as in patients with he@@ par@@ in @-@ treated pe@@ as , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than for male or younger patients .
both easy and heavy bleeding in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine were significantly less often than in the equivalent group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side effects listed above have been reported to comprehensive application in practice and are sorted according to system organ@@ classes ordered in table 6 .
in the event of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din will immediately break off and the patient is ti@@ ghter with regard to signs of a bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the Ani@@ on@@ en@@ bind@@ ungs@@ region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is tied in the liquid phase or at bar@@ inn@@ sel .
the bond of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ way divi@@ des the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
in addition , through Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Ser@@ um of patients , in which in the past it had come to hot @-@ induced Th@@ ro@@ matic syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no thy@@ ro@@ cy@@ tes @-@ reaction reaction was indu@@ ce .
in healthy trials and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine shows a dos@@ is@@ - and con@@ centric dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atorial effect , which is occupied by the extension of ACT , T@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out in the patient , an additional bol@@ us of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be increased and in@@ fusion for the duration of the operation to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h increases .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ questionable He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ ment was administered in accordance with relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ le@@ verage attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or either before starting the angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) or at PCI .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults , juven@@ iles and children over six years with diabetes , which require a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ out ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , in@@ ject the wa@@ iter or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin in the regulation of the glucose pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or that ins@@ ulin can not be effectively processed .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine is very little different from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter activity times has as a short @-@ effective human@@ ic ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in use in combination with a long @-@ term ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in Type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body can not work effectively , Ap@@ id@@ ra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indication of the efficacy was the change of concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was found in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin delivery .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % at human normal ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine or any of the other constitu@@ ents or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of ap@@ id@@ ra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
September 2004 the European Commission granted the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for approval by Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is referred to as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdom@@ en , the thi@@ ghs or del@@ u@@ cut@@ aneous or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ inal canal .
due to the decreased glucose capacity and reduced ins@@ ulin , the ins@@ ulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the active volume , the brand ( her@@ ds@@ man ) , of ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in ins@@ ulin demand .
3 An insufficient dosage or interruption of treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ tin ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to another ulin type or ins@@ ulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used ulin and can therefore change in switching to the treatment regim@@ en .
to the substances that can increase the blood sugar @-@ sugar activity and enhance the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting enzyme , di@@ ox@@ etine , di@@ ox@@ etine , di@@ ox@@ etine @-@ oxid@@ ase , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effects of sympath@@ iz@@ ol@@ y@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reser@@ pine the symptoms of the ad@@ renal bur@@ regulation will be wat@@ ered or missing .
animal experimental studies for re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ism showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human@@ ic ulin in relation to pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether ins@@ ulin delivery occurs in the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general ins@@ ulin is neither absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ ted to or@@ ally application .
following are the clinical trials well @-@ known for those undes@@ irable disease reductions , according to system organ@@ classes and ordered by decreasing the frequency of their appearance ( very common : equal 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not well @-@ known ( frequency based on the availability of availability ) .

Li@@ pod@@ stream@@ ph@@ ie Wir@@ d failed to switch the inj@@ ecting location within the inj@@ ecting range , can occur as a result of a pro@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy on the inj@@ ecting location .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia cells with awareness can be treated by a in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ cose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a trained person , or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
according to a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify the jud@@ g@@ ments for heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin lowers the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the inhibit@@ or of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ it occurs quickly and the work is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 @-@ diabetes lab@@ s , ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine in the therapeu@@ tical use of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg becomes a dose dis@@ proportion@@ ately high glucose metabolism effect , and with 0,@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate increase in the glucose metabolism , just like Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double as fast efficiency , as norm@@ ative Human@@ ins@@ ulin and achiev@@ es complete glu@@ cos@@ ity effects approximately 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
from the data it was apparent that in an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable , ran@@ ational gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
was ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better uni@@ tive control was achieved as with human@@ ic ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , is a comparative gly@@ cem@@ ic control as given at human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ ten before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 2 minutes before the start of the meal in comparison with human normal ins@@ ulin , which was 30 minutes ( normal - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) as well as compared to human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - previously ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was 2 minutes ( normal - previously ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
