<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Appeal report (EPAR), which explains how the studies conducted by Human Development (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please refer to the Packages (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or a pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets (tablets, which dissolve itself in the mouth), as a solution to take (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. enterre thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients maneuver episodes (periods of abnormal floods) alternately with periods of normal spirits.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bilify is used for the treatment of severe to severe manic episodes and the prevention of Manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection of injecting is applied to rapid control of inflated anxiety or behavioral disorders when the oric intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">For both cases, the solution to remove or the melting tablets can be applied in patients where the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines which are exactly as bilify, should be adapted to the dose of asbilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole mostly works as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters appears to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin is a role to play Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, eliminating psychotic or manic symptoms and prevent their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of bilify, to prevent re-emergence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies by up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar diseases, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study, Abilify was compared more than twelve weeks to 347 patients with semi-operated idol, in a different study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been stabilized to 160 patients where manic symptoms have already been stabilized with astrfy disease.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injections was made in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered over-led unrest, compared with the lauazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suffering on the treatment were examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies through to investigate how the body absorbed the melting tablets and the solution to invading (records).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg, or 15 mg, a significantly stronger lowering of the symptoms concilted unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying to the bipolar disorder Abilify in four of the five short-term studies have been more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bilify also prevented up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo the recurrence of Manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms halted unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side-effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrappridal disorders (uncontrollery), sedation (sleepiness), sedation (sleepiness), pessimisation (constipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Development (CHMP) got to the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from the severe to heavy episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes focused on the treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee also came to the conclusion that the benefits of injecting injecting disturbed anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder when a orale therapy is not suitable for the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for approval for the induction of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is used for the treatment of moderate to heavy episodes of the Bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and non-polar disorder in patients over 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient, a lower initialdose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-Inductor is set out of the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicide behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective dysfunctions and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti-psychotic therapy, including treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of sufficiency with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardiac disease, transitions), cerebrovascular diseases, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure receptors or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports on during treatment with Aripiprazole-related Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with an ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dydyskiesis, should be considered to reduce the dose or to disrupt the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient signs signs and symptoms that suggest a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic, including ABILIFY, must be deducted.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used in patients with crampires in Anamnese or at intervals, which are to be used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, increased sterberized compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted rovascular events with Aripiprazole-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazikor hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drug-treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed by schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar management, the application of antipsychotic, where weight gain is known as low-effect, or may lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with proven side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonis Famotidin, a stomach acid blocker, reduces the resorprate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore similar can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisians may result in common application with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher plastic concentric parts of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-Inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV-Proteasants, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="55">After lowering the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage should be raised by ABILIFY to the dosage above the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethoran / 3-Methoxymorphinan-ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethoran).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for people and the resulting concerns in animal studies, this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy, unless the possible utility is justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, even with other antipsychotics patients should be warned of the patient, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to operate until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects appeared more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks joined patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a total of reduced incidence (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathonie and Dyskinesia compared to patients who were treated with Haloperated idol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Maneuver episodes in Bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled trial for 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under half-operated idol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In a different study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term donation phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15,7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient-groups under Aripiprazole and placebo at which potentially clinically significant changes in routine-controlled laboratory parameters, were not medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine phophokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side-effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy, and about their appearance also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, spicuous events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the launch of launch unintentional or degradations with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated cans of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">While there is no information on the effectiveness of a heralzation in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; it is unlikely, that hempialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose as Aripiprazole has high plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is suspected that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole during schizophrenia and bio-I disorder over the combination of a participatory effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor and a homogeneity to the dopamine D4- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenal and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy probankers showed a dose-dependent reduction in the bond of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor Liganden, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudatus and on the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazole compared to placebo a statistically significant increase in psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operating dol-controlled trial, in week 52 the share of the Respal patients, who taught a response to the study mediation, in both groups similar (Aripiprazole 77% and Halindol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values in Messages that have been defined as secondary study agents, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depressants, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at half-operating dol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction of decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double-blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study budget (N = 18 or 13% of non-value patient records) involved significantly less than 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo over placebo over three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazole versus placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a placebo over placebo over placebo over placebo over a week 3 and a entertaining effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semiconductor in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also pointed out 12 a comparative proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on such as lithium or semiconductor.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics that partially about 2 weeks did not match Liionum- or Valproate-monotherapy in therapeutical symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, which had reached a remission with Aripiprazole compared to placebo superior in terms of prevention of bipolar residue, predominantly in preventing a back into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the stretching and hydroxyation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealcyber is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolites above CYP2D6 and in nearly 146 hours with 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolisians about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">With Aripiprazole there are no differences in the Pharmacopoinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as demonstrated in a pharmacoinetic investigation of schizophrenia, not gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A high-specific evaluation of the Pharmacopoinetics revealed no reference to clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmaceuticals of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacoinetic properties of Aripiprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison with young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study at Probanden with different engorgers liver cirrhosis (child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver cirrhosis of Aripiprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on security matology, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity, and for cancerogenic potential, the preclinical data left no particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological effects were observed merely in doses or expositions, which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they have limited liability for clinical use only.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects captured a dosis@-@ dependent side-kidney-toxicity (Lipofusine-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyfat cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at €20 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10mg / kg / day) at least 10mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended Maximaldosis in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelike is found as a result of the removal of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxycytic gases of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81fold the recommended Maximaldosis in people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human Galle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle by monkey, and lie far under the limit values (6%) of vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">With rabbits these effects were observed according to dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11,000 of the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical Maximaldosis.</seg>

<seg id="293">Neutropenie was the most remarkable important hematological toxicity (reported at 79% of the patients) and was quickly resealed and dosisdepending; Leukopenia was reported in 71% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (HB &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of patients treated with myxane patients and was severe in three cases (HB &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1 the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of myxane as monotherapy in any dose and indication have occurred in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10); rare (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactation hydrogenase in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>

<seg id="300">Repairing 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity transactions will be calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence is possible and there has been no causal connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules, which promotes the deposition of the micro-ubules from the tubules and stabilized the microtubules by inhibitions of their landfill polymerization.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibiting of the normal dynamic reorganization of mikrotubulary network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumine provides the transzytosis of plasma components in the endothelcells and in the context of in-vitro studies has been proven that the presence of Albumine promotes the transport of Paclitaxel through the endothelium cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is thought that this improved transiteelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60-Albuminator or and due to the albuminous protein's SPARC (secreted protein acidic, in cysteine) is a Paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of myxane for metastatic Mammakarom is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-bed studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparison.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients treated with metastatic mammakarzinom with myxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic mammakarom.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was performed in patients with metastatic mammakarel, either in the form of solvent-size Paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with medication for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of myxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without emmedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">When taking into the study 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastasestellen.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only a adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasification and 19% due to metastasification and adjuvant treatment.</seg>

<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to Paclitaxel was evaluated by enhancing a degree of patient who lived at a time during treatment a peripheral neuropathy degree 3.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for bottling at baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of myxane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Pharmacopoinetics of the total-Paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of myxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was established in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The substance (AUC) increased from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous gift of myxane to patients with metastatic mammakarzinom in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel-plasma took the Paclitaxel plasma-Plasmakonzentration in Multi phashic way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean volume of distribution was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or Weichteilulation of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacoinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of xane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent-resistant Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was with myxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissues, it is reported that Paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller Metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 with xane in patients with metastatic mammakarzinom, the mean value for cumulative ureterisation of the unaltered active ingredient of 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-rentional Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="386">Assimilation of symptoms and subsequent symptoms can vary depending on age, gender and total disease last; hence the assessment of individual clinical trials and pathology can be required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin to more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients may occasionally be observed in a patient individual hull-cast values on or below the hull-glockery target.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given these hereof reinvariability should be tried by an appropriate dosage management, the hemoglobin target-concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemobell is worth more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemmobell is worth 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa-dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be narrowly observed to ensure that epoetin alfa is in the lowest applicable dose which is required for the control of anaemia and an anaemia symptom.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initial low-value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance of maintenance than patients in which the initial anaemia is less heavy pronounced (HB &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the customs clearance by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance of by Cytochrom-P450-Enzymatic systems is unlikely because customs acid is not metabolized by humans and because they have a watchdog or even no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent Inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient-groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of customs acid correlated with the creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance; and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney disorder up to a creatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of customs acid requires.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since heavy kidney disorder (creatindomestic Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available for this population, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Appeal report (EPAR), which explains how the studies conducted in Human Development (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Accounts are applied to the treatment of type-2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monootherapy) in patients (particularly overweight patients). • It can be used together with a different diabetesmedia medicine (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphylharnum or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphylharnrogen or insulin can be kept in the beginning of the account process, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulphylharnite or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be used better and the blood sugar levels can be adjusted, whereby type-2 diabetes is better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of account in tripletherapy has been examined; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphylharnide, in addition they received either account for up to 3.5 years either account or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Accounts led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, which allows the blood sugar levels to be reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the extra gift from accounts to existing treatment with metformin and a sulphylharnum in a reduction of the HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional load of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of accounts and insulin in 289 patients were examined, the patients received the account in addition to insulin, lowering the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who were additionally placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side-effects associated with accounts were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper airways (colds), weight gain and hyporadiesthesia (decreasing sensitivity to irritate).</seg>
<seg id="760">Accounts must not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) compared to pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic ketoazitin (high ketone mirror) - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos are intended to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients when metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a licence for the induction of accounts in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to white, round, curved and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the magazine "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also shown for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficiently adjusted with insulin and in which metals is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under the age of 18 no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or estrogen, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and oils, if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiological Outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of cardiac insufficiency, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver illness may not be used Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-Spiegel increases up to 3 times the limit of the standard range, the liver enzymes are to control as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is developing symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, thickery, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker hardn, are the liver enzymes to review.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be continued until the foresee of the laboratory parameters are led by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be derived from fatty deposits, and in some cases associated with a liquid repairing.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a motions occurred among the therapy with Pioglitazone, a minor reduction of the middle skins (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.3%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparatively controlled trials with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobins and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 1-2% and the hematokrits by 1-3%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-sensitivity there is patients who receive pioglitazone as orale branches or triple-combination therapy with insulin gene therapy with insulin, the risk of dosis@-@ dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of the market, under the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazone, reports on a occurrence or a deterioration of a diabetic maculdems with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of maculaödems, but prescribed doctors should report the possibility of a Makulaödems if patients should report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmic declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events concerning bone broods from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The frail incidence of 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years with the women treated with Pioglitazone treated women and 1,1 questionnaires for women treated with a comparative disease.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular abnormalities, questionnaires reported at 44 / 870 (2.5%; 0.5% of 0.5 million patients) compared to patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be denied (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazis no relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamic of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin exercises.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs, which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. orale contraceptive pills, cyclosporin, Calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA-Reduction taskbar are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrous (a cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC from Pioglitazone to the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with castfampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-Inductor) resulting in a reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributed to the treatment with pioglitazone which reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance by the cervical and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgors and the breakage indexes of the lens, as they are observed in other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT covers the triple of the limit of the normal range as frequently as under placebo but less often than in comparisons between metformin or sulfonylharnide.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study involving patients with advanced advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency carried out under Pioglitazone by 1.6% higher than under placebo if Pioglitazon or w.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has rarely been reported on cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone, although Pioglitazone was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of notifications about reported events concerning bone broods from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated in the groups treated with Pioglitazon groups and over 7.400 patients in the groups treated with comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, questionnaires reported at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">In case of taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to act on an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferation), which leads in the animal model to an increased insulin of liver, fats and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral gluten in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazone versus Gliclacide used as monotherapy over two years in order to examine the time up to the retroination of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c = 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment, a blood sugar control could be defined (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) due to Pioglitazone at 69% of the patients treated under Gliclacide (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebocontrolled study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was discontinued despite dreimonatical improvement phase with insulin, to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon reduced the average HbA1c - value by 0.45%, compared to the patients who continued to obtain only insulin; a reduction of insulin delivery in the group treated with Pioglitazon group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year the statistically significant reduction in the Albumin / Kreatinin quotient compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monootherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks examination of type-2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials were observed in comparison to placebo a reduction in total plasma-glycemeride and the free fatty acids and a rise in the HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased the L- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclasia are the total plastic matrimonteride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinmirror.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, under Pioglitazone was no statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels observed during Metformin and Gliclacide diminished values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazis not only reduced the sober triglyceride but improved in addition to the increased triglyceride levels, this both via a effect on the triglglycemerid absorption as well as to the hepatic triglycemerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiological Outcome study, 5238 patients were randomized with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After orally application pioglitazone gets rapidly resorted, whereby the peak concentration on unchanging pioglitazone generally reaches 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to the effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effect of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interactions studies could be proven that Pioglitazis no relevant effect on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamic of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with cosmonglitazone (a cytochrom P450 2C8-Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-Inductor) or lowers the Plasmakonzentration of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive marker pioglitazone in humans the marker was mainly found in the feces (55%) and to a lesser extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination period of unaltered Pioglitazone amounts to men 5-6 hours, and all of the active Metabolites lies at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Plasmakonzentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function lower than in healthy trials, although the rarities of the oral Clearance of the cervical.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in accordance with repetitive administration, plastic-volume enlargement with skins, anaemia and reversible coronary heart hypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with pioglitazone which reduces hyperinsullemia and increased insulin resistance by the cervical and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates to federate growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) have been induced by the rat increased incidences of hyperplasia (for male and female rats) and tumors (with male rats) of the ureter epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) conducted the treatment with two other Thiazolidindions to an increased frequency of colonization.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular abnormalities, questionnaires reported at 44 / 870 (2.5%; 0.5% of 0.5 million patients) compared to patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study on two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or Glicas have been studied.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year a statistically significant reduction in the Albumin / Kreatinin quotient compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazis not only the sober triglyceride but improved in addition to the elevated triglyceride levels, this both via a effect on the tryglycemerid absorption as well as to the hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was mised with regard to its primary end point, which is a combination of the total ality, non-fatal coronary syndrome, stroamputation above the ankle, coronarer revascularization and revascularisation of the leg arteries, put the results close, that with the intake of Pioglitazone, no cardiovascular risk.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplation fees or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in the formulation or the régime should only be performed under the narrowed control of one in the transplant physician (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding can be performed to make sure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmaceuticals of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular identification of the serverinine mirror, a calculation of the creatininferance and monitoring of the urethra) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin on Advagraf At the conversion from a Ciclosporin on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the valley mirror in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of replicance and tolerability in an individual case under the aid of full blood-Tacrolimus decline levels checks.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common controls of the Tacrolimus rate during the first two weeks of transplant, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled according to conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosisadaption, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or with the simultaneous application of substances which could change the Tacrolimus full-blood concentration, (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low Clearance, adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the reflection in the blood 20 ng / ml does not exceed.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the slowdown levels of Tacrolimus in full blood lies in the first time after liver transplants usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in alignment - and warm transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent treatment of liver, kidney and heart transplantion, generally blood-concentration were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe unwanted events, including transplanations or other side-effects which can occur in a row of Tacrolimus under- or superficiency.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in the formulation or the régime should only be performed under the narrowed control of one in the transplant physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolims - concentrations in the blood are offered because the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial authorisation, the CHMP has further evaluated the benefits of risk - weighing continues to be positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP did on the basis of the Security profils of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the filing should apply for a further trial in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Genox Molecular Limited, the Committee on Human Development (CHMP) officially approved that the company withdrawing its application for approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1644">'exin would have injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancerous cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made of the non-defective in the human body, p53-gene, contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and killing the cells if the DNA can not be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancerous cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company placed data from a study with a patient, at the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of the construction, into the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP had examined the answers of the company on the questions he asked, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on testing of initial documents the CHMP takes up a list of 120 a list of questions sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni-Tumore benefits for the patient brings.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration, as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not been sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or "Comes-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed action release" means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective components immediately and the other is slowly being released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aeropaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, by an allergy to pollen caused by inflammation of the nose-up) in patients with nasal sfskin swelling (petrol nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers from 12 years onwards the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms, above all the swelling of the nose-endometrium (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be diminished by the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main stress levels were the changes in the severity of the hay fever, which were reported by patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients received their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever, out of the constipation of the nose reported the patients who captured Aerinaze, over a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in the patient, the pseudo-ephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal endometrium was considered, the patients reported among the Aeropaze a relieving of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26,7% to the patient who captured Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachykares (cardiovascular), seizoning, psychomotoric hyperactivity (disorder, headaches, fatigue, insomnia), somnolenz (sleepiness), sleeves and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudo-ephedrine or one of the other constituents, against adrenergic substances or lauatadine (a different medicine for the treatment of allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients suffering from a Engdangle glaucoma (aggravated water pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases (hypertension), cardiac or vascular disease (hypertension caused by cerebral blood) or have a risk for a stroke of stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to approve the Aerinaze of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to swallow in the whole (i.e. without breaking up or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the misunderstanding and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after lowering the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the use of usage to 10 days because of long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take over time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">By decreasing the swelling of the mucosas in the upper airways, the treatment can be continued with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aeropaze pseudoephex contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) or inhibitors or within 2 weeks after termination of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimetic activity in combination with other vasoconstrictors like Bromocripitin, pergolid, Lisurid, vomiting, Dihydropootamin, phenylephrine, epheels, oxymetazoline, nhazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of these binational therapy has not been checked for this patient collective and the data does not range from telling appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosaze have not been tested for patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data does not range from telling appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about the treatment at the occurrence of hypertension or a tick populations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (like headache or contraction of headaches) must be deducted.</seg>
<seg id="1677">When treating the following patient-groups, patients with cardiac arrhythmia • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardiac attack in the anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder or bronchospasmus in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aeropaze is available at least 48 hours before performing dermatological testing as antihistaminika otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for bonding actions or reduce to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasticadation of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor testing we could not find significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether desloratadine has been taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme of Desloratadin responsible Enzyme has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin hemmed in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycopic one.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The incalculability of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not backed up, experiences made from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, does not increase the frequency of abnormalities when compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Because Reproduction studies on animals can not always be transmitted to humans and due to vasoconstriktorical properties of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be elucidated about it that in very rare cases it can come to a benomeness, which can lead to impairment of transportation or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary from a ZNS depression (sedation, Apnoe, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular disease) and a ZNS-stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettuals.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, complicated mition, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, coronation, cardiac insufficiency, cardiac, Transmal, nausea, vomiting, coronary pain, taps, tampie, visual dysfunctions and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS-stimulation is particularly probable in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-drying, peupillary arre and - dilatation, bonding, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibiting of the release of projorical cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastcells / Basophiles as well as the inhibitions of the expression of the adolescence P-Selektin on endothelcells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study involving adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes, including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks connected with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">Controlled clinical trials was found during the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The orale application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can generate additional personable effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachykarst or manifestations of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients Aerinaze tablets received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histaminantagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the total cores for symptoms (except nose-skin swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoepheit over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerosaze tablets with regard to the dropping effect, determined by the nose-sal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study to the Pharmacopoinetics of aerinaze, desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">According to the perorical application of Aerinaze near healthy trials over 14 days the fly-weight of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudo-epheadine is reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacoinetic multi-specialist study, which has been carried out with the wording as tablet to healthy adult probanden, has been found that four Probanden desloratadine is very rare.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in total of eight studies with about 4 800 adult and young people with allergic rhinitis (including four studies at seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by modifying the symptoms (itching, number and size of the squeezing, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to prove that the body helps the syrup, the solution to the one and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">If allergic rhinitis resulted in when the results of all studies were gathered, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius had to average decrease of the symptom (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtikaria, the withdrawal of the symptom varies after six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in those treated with placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, loratadine or any of the other constituents.</seg>
<seg id="1728">January 2001 the European Commission granted the European Commission SP Europe for approval of the induction of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persist allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see below section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical studies for the effectiveness in the use of desloratadine in young people from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittentically allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be completed after lowering the symptoms ended and at their re-occur will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persist allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during most allergy time a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see below section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinically pharmacological study, in the simultaneous intake of Aerius and alcohol, the powerful effect of alcohol is not reinforced (see below section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be elucidated about it that in very rare cases it can come to benomeness, which can lead to impairment of transportation or the ability to use machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">For clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic priticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported side effects that reported more prevalent than in placebo were fatigue (1,2%), oral aridity (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">During a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side-effect headaches, these were treated at 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadine and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-specialist study, where up to 45 mg of desloratadine (ninetly clinical dose) have been administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibiting of the release of prostrata cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastcells / Basophiles as well as the imitation of the expression of the adolescence P-Selektin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multi-awareness, in the desloratadine in a dosage given up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinically pharmacological study, in the desloratadin in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the newerfold of the clinical dose) administered for ten days, does not show an extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>

<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, nascent secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear, and redness of the eyes, as well as itch on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into dependence on the duration of the symptoms, as well as in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persist allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persist allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the whole body of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhino-octivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic priticaria has been studied for other forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathgeology irrespective of the etiology is similar to the different forms and chronically patients can become easier prospectively.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 shared Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. the Committee on Human Development (CHMP) officially stated that the company withdrawing its application for approval from Aflunov to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect flu, which is caused by the trunk (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that could cause a strain of influenza virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the grip virus emerges, which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts contained in the vaccine as" "" "body alien" "" "and antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later able to form in contact with a flu-virus this pedigree faster antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane keepers of the virus with the "surface anti-gens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as body-foreign) separated and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine should not be fulfilled in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are interested in a clinical examination and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For further information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, with the humanic immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which is inflicated by the acquired immunic Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can not swallow the capsules, Agenerase is indeed available as a solution to one, but this cannot be taken along with konavir because the security of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined the antiviral medicines of the patient before, and the probability suggested that the virus will respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg of konavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces in case of ingestion in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them on low levels.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS do not cure AIDS but may delay the damage of the immune system and thus delay the development of AIDS related infections and illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was evaluated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without chionavir, studied in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adult, which were previously not treated with easing assignments.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low dosified Ritonavir increased medicines Agenerase was compared to 206 adults, which had formerly been reported by approval approval.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indication of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with undetectable levels of HIV in the blood (Viral last) or the change in virus burden after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously suffered no proteasants, after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a viral burden below 400 copies / ml than under placebo but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also decreased the Viral burden, but with the children who previously had been treated with Proteasers, very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Proteasantry that had been dealt with with Ritonavir increased medicines Agenerase the Viral last after 16-week treatment as effective as other protein inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was restrained against four other proteasers, it came under Agenerase along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the viral burden after four weeks as in the patients who carry out their hitherto approval approval:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), Flatulence (brass), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Amneavir or any of the other constituents.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase is also not used in patients, the curb herb (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines, which are just as diverse as Agenerase and are detrimental to high concentrations in the blood health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, in patients who are disgenerase, the risk of lepodystrophy (changes in distribution of body fat), a osteonekass (Abdie of bone tissue) or an immune system syndroms (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human Development (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken along with the pharmacoinetic amplifier, but the committee found that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously won no proteasants.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved in" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since the approval was limited for scientific reasons only limited information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000 the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited for approval for the induction of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, Proteasinhibitor (PI )-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenerase capsules are to be administered to the pharmacoinetic boosts of Ampriavir along with low doses of konavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ampriavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resilience and the patient treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ampriavir as a solution to take is 14% less than from Ampriavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution to insertion on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg Ampriavir twice daily along with 100 mg of konavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the intensifying addition of konavir (boosts), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amneavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amthavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The Pharmacopoinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteasants have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on unobjectionable and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacoinetic data the dose to Agenerase capsules should be reduced to approximately 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver enzymes on 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder, in patients with severe liver disorder, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and furthermore substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, contain the curb herb (hypericum perforatum) may not be applied due to the risk reduction plastic and a diminished therapeutic effect of Ampriavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Ascare or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cause a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">In general, Agenerase capsules are to be applied along with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with antiretroviral therapy therapy, have increased risk of severe liver interactions with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of the simultaneous viral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant technical information of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing limited liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under antiretroviral therapy therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticone or other glucose metabolism, that is not recommended over CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment the risk of systemic corticosteroids including murder and supcompression of the renal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA-Reductase inhibitor is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin due to the increased risk of myopathia including Rhabdomyolysen is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening unwanted side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International standards for ratio), are available methods for the determination of the drug concentric.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who are taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of decreased plastic bricks (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Ampriavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills may be altered, however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with Ammoavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiattightening symptoms, especially if there is also low doses administered by Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high Propylglycolgecontent of the amgenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms, or the grinding are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including proteasers, has reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an Exazure of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>

<seg id="1956">Ugly patients (Type A and B), which have been treated with Proteasers, are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous haemomas and hamarthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">With HIV infected patients with severe immune defective, at the time of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory opportunistic therapy (ART) to develop a inflammatory opportunistic infections that leads to severe clinical states or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial Ätiology is accepted (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol intake, heavy immune, higher Body Mass Index), cases of Osteonekass, in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4-substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and furthermore substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with inferior width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be given along with pharmaceuticals, whose active ingredients are mainly linked to CYP2D6 and are linked to the increased plasma bar with severe and / or life-threatening unwanted effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC by Amneavir, which can lead to a cervical failure and to cause a relief development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">When trying to equip the plastic bar by a dosage increase of other protein inhibitors in combination with konavir, very frequently unwanted effects were observed at the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskwort (hypericum perforatum) The servo mirror of Ampriavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johanniskwort (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">When a patient takes already curiskweed, the aminder mirror is and, if possible to check the viral burden and disintegrate the carnwort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary when Nelfinavir is administered together with Amr avir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, for Cmax with 30% reduced if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with Ampriavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of amanchavir twice daily and konavir 100 mg twice daily applied to the effectiveness and unobjectionable of this treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% limit when Amdivir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of konavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ampriavir (plasma 2 mg twice daily) reached with Kaletra (400 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of konavir twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of konavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A intake recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Ampriavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended to be a very widespread monitoring, as the effectiveness and inconsistency of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There has been no pharmacoinetic study conducted in combination with Didanosin, but is recommended due to the imaginable component of Didanosin, that the income of Didanosine and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in the gift of Efavir in combination with Ampriavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) does not require a dosage adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Ampriavir and Sainoxavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protein inhibitor would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other proteasants and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin the serum concentric run of Ampriavir may possibly lowers.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin because of the decreased or possibly sub-therapeutic plastic can be less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough preclinical and virological monitoring should be made since a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Ampriavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of amniavir and rifabuene led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin around 193% and thus increases the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, becomes a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacoinetic studies involving Agenerase in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, however the plasma bar of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamniazole once daily led to an increase in the cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69fold in comparison with the value that has been observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamoxavir by Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or induction of CYP3A4, if they are applied together with Agenerase, possibly result in interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic responses, which are linked with these medicines if they are applied in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasants, it is advisable that Antazida will not be taken at the same time as Agenerase, since it can come to resilience.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as an enzyme therapies known as enzyme phenobarbital, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Ampriavir may lead to a humiliation of plasticavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium compounds like Amlodipin, Diltiazem, ridipin, ripendipin, nifidipin, nifidipin, nifidipin and Verapamil can be increased by Amneavir, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma-concentration and amplify with PDE5 inhibitors in connection related side effects including hypotension, visual defects and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days at Probanden, the Fluticasonpropionat-plasma bar rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol rose by about 86% of agank (90% -confidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous jail of Agenerase is not recommended with Ritonavir along with these glukokorticosteroids, unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose interlocking strongly dependent on CYP3A4, have pronounced elevations of plasma bars at the same time of simultaneous administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmaspipelines are not recommended for these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors to myopathia including one Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these medicines is not recommended using amestraviolr.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended for frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilizing the mirror, since Plasmakonzentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased at the current gift of Amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase is not allowed to be applied together with oral midazolam midazolam (see Section 4.3), while with equal use of Agenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other Proteaseinhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plastic bar of Midazolam on the 3- up to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Ammoavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiattightening symptoms, especially if there is also low doses administered by Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the very low reliability of historical vertices at present, no recommendation is given, such as the Ammoavir- dose is to be adapted when Ammoavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With current consumption of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, along with Agenerase, an enhanced control of the INR (International standard for ratio) is recommended for the possibility of weakening or strengthening of anti-thrombogenic effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of konavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not pressible, therefore also alternative methods to contraception methods are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in the current consumption of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2037">The primary analysis introduced the non-risk of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the SOC-PI-group with regard to the age-up decimal number (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-underpin wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the effectiveness of unbundled astrease is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In studies Agenerase is a solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">It was not given a low dosified Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs combined with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the included patients received a plasma-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in the CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output value.</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of Ammoavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ampriavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained uninfluenced by the food intake, although the simultaneous intake of the scale and rate of the resilient remained.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The seemless distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be reduced to a large distribution volume, as well as an uneven penetration of Ampriavir from the bloodstream into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma, whereby the amount of immeasurem amanchavir which represents the active share is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbridled Ammoavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during the dose of course in dependence on the total doctor's offence in steady state over the range of Cmax, ss up to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines must induce the CYP3A4 or inhibitors or a substrate of CYP3A4, be given with caution when they are given simultaneously with Agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily aminder-exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ampriavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of kidney function is likely to be minor to the elimination of Ampriavir and Ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the growing addition of konavir (boosts), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amneavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amthavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2072">A intake recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Ampriavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended to be a very widespread monitoring, as the effectiveness and inconsistency of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Ampriavir and Sainoxavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protein inhibitor would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these medicines are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough preclinical and virological monitoring should be made since a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Ampriavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calcium compounds like Amlodipin, Diltiazem, ridipin, ripendipin, nifidipin, nifidipin, nifidipine and Verapamil can be increased by Amneavir, causing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days at Probanden, the Fluticasonpropionat-plasma bar rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol rose by about 86% of agank (90% -confidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With current consumption of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, along with Agenerase, an enhanced control of the INR (International standard for ratio) is recommended for the possibility of weakening or strengthening of anti-thrombogenic effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg of Einyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin by Ampriavir by 22% or more.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrees slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetrexed into its active form goes more easily than in healthy cells, resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug, and a longer duration of cancer in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Alimta was examined for the treatment of malignant pleuresothelioms Alimta in a main study of 456 patients who previously had no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta were treated in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy effects by docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (a further medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study on 1 725 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) The CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haemological toxicity from Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient's patient's value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA has to be broken when in patients following 2 dosisreductive toxicity or non-hamatologic toxicity or so- continue with the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 patients or compared to patients aged under the age of 65 has increased risk-risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non-sufficient data for unobjectionable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials were necessary for patients with a creatinin Clearance of about 45 ml / min no dosage adaptations necessary, which are recommended for all patients recommended Dosisations.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinin Clearance from below 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However patients were examined with a liver functionalities of &gt; 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- border-value and / or Transaminasenvalues of &gt; 3.0-fold the upper border value (near liver sampling) or &gt; 5.0-fold the upper border value (for presence of liver testing) not specifically studied in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be supervised with regard to Kno- chenmarkers and Pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutral number has a value of about 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Thrombogenic number has once again achieved a value of over 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dosage-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutral number, Thrombogenic number and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they have been observed in previous treatment cycles - (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hemropencils, such as neutropenie, febrile neutropenie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenie has been validated when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients need to be reliant with pemetxed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must be the simultaneous intake of non-steroidal anti phlogistika (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and acetylsalivary (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and mindes- TENS 2 days after therapy with pemetreels (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for treatment with pemetrepositories, the intake of NSAIDs must be avoided with a long semi-term for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetreels (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occur, had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid waste collection in the transcellular room a drainage of the coding before the pemetremixed treatment can be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular abnormalities, including myocardiac disease, and deebrovascular events were reported in clinical studies with pemetreels occasionally, when this substance was usually administered in combination with any other cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application is not recommended (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is possible, men should be advised before the treatment - ginn to obtain advice on sperm production.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance, BSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylate in high dosage (≥ 1,3 g per day) to a decreased pemetreportable excretion with the result of a multiply result of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance from 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsaline acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or Acetylsalicyl- acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and mindes- TENS 2 days after treatment with pemetremixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with regard to interaction with NSAIDs, with a long-term such as Piro- xicam or rofecycle, the simultaneous application must be avoided with pemetxed for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variation of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of INR (International standards for ratio) if the decision was made to treat the patient - ducks with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetxed in pregnant women, but as with andepuren Antimescolites are expected in an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be applied during pregnancy, except if strictly necessary and according to thorough examination of the user for the mother and risk to the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by Pemetrepositories, men should be advised before the treatment course in order to obtain advice on sperm-preservatives.</seg>

<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the bond of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to prevent the receptors in the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults, which received chemotherapy regimens who are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapy regimens, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are showed 59% of the patients treated with Aloxi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron's patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">For chemotherapy regimens, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients were treated with aloxi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron's patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">When compared with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005 the European Commission shared Helsinki on Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the abouts of Aloxi in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicative: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with severe emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding a particular corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonotic tron may extend the coldarmple age, patients should be supervised with anamnesty arrangement or signs of a subacute Ileus after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable to extend the current purchase of Palonotic tron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Apart from connection with another chemotherapy agents, Aloxi in the days following chemotherapy did not be used to prevent nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonotic tron inhibits the tumours of the five investigational chemotherapy agents not (cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, cycabling, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial, there were no significant pharmacoinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose Palonotic tron and a Steady-stats concentration of a CYP2D6-Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based upon a population based pharmacoinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous casting of CYP2D6 inductors, Celecetiine, Haloxetine, paroxin, koxin, kinidine, koxin and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonotic tron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences to use Palonotic tron in human pregnancies do not lie, therefore, Palonotic tron should not be applied in pregnant women, unless it is considered to be necessary by the prescribing doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observe side effects (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly were related to Aloxi in connection with headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of transitions and reactions of the administration (burning, curing, discomfort and pain) were stated in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosing showed similar frequencies of undesirable events as in the other metering groups; there were no dose-active relations to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, because of the great distribution of distribution, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy in a aloology - overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blinded studies were received a total of 1,132 mg / m2, Carboplatin, &lt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide, and 1,25 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours) received, that was given to day 1 without Dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients, who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and Dacarbazin, as well as 250 or 750 micrograms Palonotic tron, received with patients who were 32 mg of Ondansetron that were given to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-etogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for indicator-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonotic tron on blood pressure, heart rate and eKG parameters including the respective effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron were comparable.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical trials, Palonotic tron possesses the ability to block the ionals and repolarization of the ionals and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy test results was the assessment of the EKG effects of i.V administered Palonotic tron in single dosis of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gases follows a initiale decrease of the plasmakonzentrations a slow elimination of the body with average terminalen half-time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentric (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration period (AUC0- ∞) are generally observed in the whole tin range of 0.3- 90 μ / kg in gestures and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonotic tron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, between day 1 and day 5 were measured average (± SD) increase in Palonotic tron Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacoinetic simulations, that at once a daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg of Palonotic tron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞), with which after single intravenous administration of 0.75 mg of measured value; however, the Cmax after the reproduction of 0,75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated over the kidneys, and some other 50% will be converted into two primary metabolism, which in comparison to Palonotic tron is less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metallization have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the Isois EYP3A4 and CYP1A2 is involved in the Metabolism of Palonotic tron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonotic tron were found about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonotic tron as an unchanging active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous stufftion in gestds, the total body was between 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While in patients with severe liver supplements, the terminale Elimination period and the average systemic exposure to Palonotic tron is increased, but a reduction in the dose is thus not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials effects, effects were observed only according to expositions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 from preclinical studies suggest that Palonotic tron can only block in very high concentrations of Ionenkaners, who are involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and lengthen the action-potential.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonotic tron (any dose corresponded in about the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure to humans) that were given daily for two years led to a multiply frequency of liver tumors, endocrine, pancreatic, pancreatic, pancreatic and tumours in rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but because of the used high dosages and da Aloxi when humans are used for unique use, the relevance of these results is low valued as humans.</seg>

<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data, showing the comparison of Alpheon with roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the pharmaceutical, drug, safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference practitioner via 455 patients.</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were voiced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon flammates the disease in more patients than with the reference supplement; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from that, the test has been resolved in the study to determine the extent the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of Impetite (one with crust-going skin infection) and small ininfected Lazzations (Rissor or cutting-faded), shakes and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven to be proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant sthylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not affect these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under 18 may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should re-examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial strap (the parts of the bacterial cells that are produced in which proteins are produced) and thus inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indication of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was withdrawn after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected ctwines, Altargo and cefalexin showed similar contact: if the results of both studies were gathered at home networks, about 90% of the patients of both groups fell to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo was observed in the treatment of abscesses (eiterous cavity in the body tissue) or by infections caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The commonest side-effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation to the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Development (CHMP) got to the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo during the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmary, sealing, or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007 the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Altargo into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients in which no improvement could be taken within two to three days are to be considered once and an alternative treatment should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of raising awareness or heavy local irritation through the use of retapamulin saline the treatment is broken down, the saline carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary wounds, the effectiveness of reapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant stackus aureus (MRSA) were caused, insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment, no improvement or a deterioration of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the small plasma concentric, that have been achieved with humans to topical skin on poor skin or infected superficial wounds, is a clinically relevant imitation in vivo not to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous onset of 2 times per day 200 mg Ketoconazol increased the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe to the needy skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosisadaptations are not required if topical reapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductionicity after oric intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the federal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial treatment is clear and the use of reapamulin for the gift of a systemic antibiotic treatment is preferred.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / ends or the therapy with Altargo continues to be terminated, is between the benefit of breastfeeding for infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies at 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied Altargo, was the most frequently reported side-effect irirritation in the administration of approximately 1% of the patients concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Active Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is treated by Fermentation from Clitopilus passeckery anus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of reapamulin is based on the selective inhibitor of the bacterial protein synthesis, due to interaction at a particular bonding of the 50s subunit of the bacterial reef, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the Binding Boomales Protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P connector and the Peptidyltransferasezanne.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By loyalty to this ties, Pleasuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, blocking partial P-ties interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be focused on the basis of local prevalence to the application of reapamulin for at least some infection forms, a consultation should be pursued by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of reapamulin compared to S.aurreus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-appeal to the treatment in S.aurreus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults was born 1% Retapamulin Salbe daily using occlusion on intact and deported skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary wounds were reported, individual plasmash were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling procedure took place 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the mediation and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic shot at the people after topical application of 1% salbe on 200 cm2 deported skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is applied to the protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not impartial against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used within a framework of two doses, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason Ambirix is allowed to only be used when the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccination plan comes to an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other hepatitis-A- or -B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have to act by bringing them to the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "as it can be opposed to a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens than "foreign" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the approved vaccine Twinrix adults since 1996 and has been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same illnesses, but TwinSAFE adults and Twinrix children are administered from three doses to existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that uses the application of Twinrix adults are also used as testament to the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indication of the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection of antibodies to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the level of protection of Ambirix was similar at a six-month intervals between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccines) are headache, loss of appetite, pain on the injection, redness, matures (fatigue) as well as friction.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not respond to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission shared GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the inducing of Ambirix throughout the</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the Grundimmation with Ambirix consists of two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher chimney is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the vaccinated vaccines can be vaccinated with the corresponding months.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B-virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immune to have addressed to a Hepatitis A- vaccination, a refresher chimney as a protection, since they are also protected in no longer detectable antibodies because of immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections should be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and supervision may always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the Standardifschema is recommended using the composite substrate, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinincompatible hepatitis-A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis-B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, after the Grundimmation, is achieved under certain circumstances no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies so that in these cases the gift of further vaccinations can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since a intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could result in the gluteal muscle to a subtle implications, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in Thrombocytopia or blood-minded disorders, Ambirix can be injected out in subcutaneous as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If ambirix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate diphtherious, Tetanus-, azellular polomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined masern- mumps-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined species of mumps, the immune response was given to all antigens sufficiently (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients under immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective needs to be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was conducted with 3 vaccinations of this wording in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matures, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in earlier Thiomersal- and preservative vaccine-containing vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies 2029 vaccinations were administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to that of the 3-load regularity.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mateness on a calculation basis per vaccination basis Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50,7% of the test, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-load regularity.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete inofecycle, 66,4% of the test, the Ambirix had received, about pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects, which were vaccinated with the 3-Dos- commuzzle.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of mateness was comparable to a proverb (i.e., over the entire vaccine-cycle at 39.6% of the test, the Ambirix received, compared with 36.2% in the subjects that received the 3-load regulator).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and mateness was low and comparable that was observed after administration of the compromise with the 3-load vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study with 1- to 11-year vaccinations, the occurrence of locating actions and general actions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that which was formative in administration with the 3-load regulative hepatitis-A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis-B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">With the 6- to 11am s, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent appearance of pain (on the injecting location) per dose, not per admill.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccinations that reported about severe side-effects during the 2-load vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-load vaccine with the combinant hepatitis-A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis-B- surface antigen was statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were conducted at vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years, the Seroconversionrates for anti-HAV 99.1% were a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversionrates for anti-hbs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- until 15-year-olds, 142 two cans Ambirix and 147 the standard combinant with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">With 289 people whose immunoassures had been leadable, the seroprotting rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of 3-can-immaterial was significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study during 1- to 11-year-year after completion of the full vaccinations (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations were either a 2-load vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-load vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA-units formalininactivated hepatitis-A-virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis-B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For persons who were at the time of pridimmation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be demonstrated over at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix in 0-6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction against both antigens was comparable with that, after vaccination of 3 cans with a compromise, made up of 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis-B surface finishes in a tin volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- including 15-year-olds could be demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies comparable to 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6- months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0-12-month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose Ambirix acquired in the second year of life simultaneously with the refresher Diphtheri-, azellular polomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or administered with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine, was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this current formulation in adults, showed the current formulation similar seroprotective and sero convertible as for earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased salary to effective components each vaccine (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis-B surface area).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with decreased content to effective components is usually administered a month after the initial dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection before ending the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient to the vaccine and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given with Ambirix at the same time, should be vaccinated in separate places and as different extremities.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has become known since the issuance of the first approval for the Introduction, the CHMP opinion that the risk-risk for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix starts only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data are limited to this medicine because of low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonetic Encephalopathy (brain injury following high ammoniaccompliations) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is distributed - split into several single dots with meals - swallowed, among the food mixed or over a Gastrostomieschlalso (through the abdomen into the stomach leading) or a nostride (through the nose into the stomach leading) administered.</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammongers could not be compared to any other treatment or placebo (a hypomedication that could be compared without the substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also cause loss of appetite in blood, depression, stimulability, headache, fainability, vomiting, flavors or taste conversion, abdominal pain, vomiting, vomiting, rash, uncomfortable body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Development (CHMP) got to the conclusion that Ammonaps is effectively prevented in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle to high ammonitions.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was registered under "exceptional circumstances," as due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is contraindicated in all patients when a complete enzyme is already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-modular form (incomplete enzyme defect, which is manifested after the first life months) there is an indicator of the use when in the Anamnese a hyperammondac Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with raimbalances, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually computed in consideration of protein-tolerant and the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium polyphenyl is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early maniac phosphor synthetase or orniintranscarbamylase, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininous inatase lack must arginine in a dosage of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with raimbalances as a risk for the emergence of osophoganulcera, if the tablets are not immediately able to enter into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polybutt, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive cardiac insufficiency or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention, and odeformation of clinical states only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Da metallization and excretion of sodium polybutt via the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is thus contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous gases of phenylacetate at young rattas in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowing of neural tube and to a heightened loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a hesitant maturation of distorrales synapses and a diminished number of working nerve agents in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is left in the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during lactation is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients employed at least an undesirable event (AE), and at 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from an 18 year old paranormal patio, which developed an metabolic Encephalia in conjunction with Laktatacoutlet, heyytopia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred during a 5-month-child-child with a accidentally single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms enter with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosislimiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an metabolic active compound that is handled by acetylate with glutamine in phenylacetylglutamine, which is divorced across the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometric is phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be accepted that for every gram, Natrial phenylbutyrat between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is placed early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival prognosis and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early-manifactual form of disease with appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was early almost always infaust, and the disease carried out even in the treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with their stuffed free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By modialysis, the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen secretion (sodium and sodium polyphenacetate), proteinphenylbutt, sodium and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of restless in post-partal (however, within the first life months), diagnosed with 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and were treated before the first appearance of a hyperammoned Encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients it was time with many spiritual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-tight shape of the condition (including feminine patients with the heterozygous form of orniintranscarboultry-deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonetic Encephalopathy and then permanently with sodium phenylbutor and a proteinated diet, the surplus-rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment and some patients may occur further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is construed in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyat and of his metabolites in plasma and urine were made according to gift of a single dose of 5 g Natrium phenylbutyat in sober metabolism and with liver cirrhosis of reproduction as well as repetitive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and his metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous gases (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g Natrial phenylbutyate in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after ingestion Plasmakonzentrations by Phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urethane dysfunctions or hemoglobeopathies (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning after consuming no phenylacetate in plasma.</seg>

<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, Natrium phenylbutyat with toxic and non-toxic doses had no enclagenic effects (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken either oral (infants and children who have not swallow tablets, or patients with raimbalances) or via a Gastrostomieschlauch or a Gastrostoma.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium polyphenyl is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and servo proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early maniac phosphor synthetase or orniintranscarbamylase, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for treatment of adult patients with "acute coronary" (ACS, decreased blood sugar to the heart), for example with instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocaress attack (cardiancase) without "ST- Hebung" (an anomalous measurement of electrocardiogram or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help with patients with Angina or coronary heart to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox at all gift or in conjunction with a glycopate-IIb / IIIA-Inhibitor (GPI) compared with conventional compression treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often became a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a delay) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the Gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, coronary cases or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI, angiox regarding all indicators was just as effective as Heparin, except for heavy bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudin, other deer or any of the other constituents.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be applied in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as men with heavy high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a cardiac infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Development (CHMP) got to the conclusion that Angiox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable substitute for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">September 2004 shared the European Commission of The Medicines Company UK Ltd. a permit for the induction of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous stuffing of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a single Bolus-Gift of Angiox is not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">This value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to 225 seconds, should be a second bolster of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values, the reconstituent and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and administered rapidly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, further supervision is no longer required, provided that 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In case of patients with moderate kidney control (GFR 30-59 ml / min) that can be subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower Infusion rate should be used by 1,4 mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney study, which was included in the phase III- PCI study (Replace-2) that led to approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the Gift of the Bivalirudine-Bolus with no dosage adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (FR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients is contraindicated (see below 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be introduced 30 minutes after completion of the subcutaneous yeast or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous bells of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• well-known hypersensitivity to the active ingredients or an other constituents or against deer • active bleeding or increased blood stress disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subverge bacterial endocarditis. • heavier kidney damage (FR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are prescribed during treatment carefully in terms of symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI-patients under Bivalirudine occur the most bleeding in arterial point of points, in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), while the treatment generally occur everywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, the monitoring of the INR factory (International Standards of ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with Bivalirudin was once again reached before the treatment of existing level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Departing from the knowledge about the mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombogenic Engine) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalirudine with Thrombogenic agents or anticoagulants are the clinical and biological hemostaseparameters in any case regularly control.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The following experimental tests are inadequate in terms of impact on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the removal or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestionable army parine or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in patients with heparin-treated comparisons, it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than for male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy bleeding have been defined according to the ACUITY and TIMI standards for heavy bleeding like in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bivalirudine alone less often than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitor and BivaliDrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: intracellational blood or bleeding required, hematological or surgical intervention required, reduction of the hemmockbell mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known blood-point, reoperation due to a bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">More, less frequently watched blood-localisations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), "other" scores, retroperitoneal, gastroar, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalirudine at 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudine group as well as in patients with heparin-treated peas, it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than for male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both easy and heavy bleeding in Bivalirudine were significantly less often than in the equivalent group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects listed above have been reported to comprehensive application in practice and are sorted according to system organclasses ordered in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the event of an overdose, the treatment with Bivalirudin will immediately break off and the patient is tighter with regard to signs of a bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and the Anionenbindungsregion of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is tied in the liquid phase or at barinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of bivalirudine at Thrombin, and hence its effect, is reversible because Thrombin sway divides the bond of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, thus generates the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirudine with Serum of patients, in which in the past it had come to hot-induced Thromatic syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no thyrocytes-reaction reaction was induce.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy trials and in patients Bivalirudine shows a dosis- and concentric dependent anticoagulatorial effect, which is occupied by the extension of ACT, TPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was carried out in the patient, an additional bolus of 0,5mg / kg Bivalirudine should be increased and infusion for the duration of the operation to 1.75mg / kg / h increases.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unquestionable Heparin or Enoxaparment was administered in accordance with relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with instabiler Angina / non-ST-leverage attack (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor either before starting the angiography (at the time of Randomization) or at PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk pensions, which required a angiography within 72 hours required, uniformly across the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurrent infmia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients subjected themselves within 72 hours of a angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and the 1- year point for the total population (ITT) and for the patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before the angiography or before the PCI) were presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on four-subject and triple-end points of a randomised double-blind study with over 6,000 patients who undergo a PCI (Replace-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacoinetic properties of Bivalirudine were evaluated in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudine as Peptid sees a catabolism in its amino acid constituent parts with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metaboite, which results from the split of the Arg3-Pro4 attachment of the N-terminalen sequence through Thrombin results, is not effective due to the loss of his affinity to the catalytic centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a process of first order with a terminalen half-term of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on the conventional studies on security matology, toxicity, toxicity or reproductionism, the preclinical data can be seen no particular dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, juveniles and children over six years with diabetes, which require a treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutout (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, inject the waiter or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of the glucose piegels (sugar) in the blood or that insulin can not be effectively processed.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisine is very little different from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter activity times has as a short-effective humanic ulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in use in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In Type-2 diabetes, in which the body can not work effectively, Apidra was investigated in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indication of the efficacy was the change of concentration of substance glycosylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type-1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was found in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2 diabetes, the reduction of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with apidra compared to 0.30% at human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisine or any of the other constituents or in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of apidra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004 the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for approval by Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is referred to as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdomen, the thighs or delucutaneous or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal canal.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased glucose capacity and reduced insulin, the insulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active volume, the brand (herdsman), of insulin (normal, NPH, galvanized, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or interruption of treatment, in particular in patients with an insulin-based diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic ketoazitin; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another ulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used ulin and can therefore change in switching to the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that can increase the blood sugar-sugar activity and enhance the inclination to hypoglycemic, angiotensin-Converting enzyme, dioxetine, dioxetine, dioxetine-oxidase, salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effects of sympathizolytics such as Betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and reserpine the symptoms of the adrenal burregulation will be watered or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductionism showed no differences between Insu- linglulisine and humanic ulin in relation to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin delivery occurs in the human mother's milk, but in general insulin is neither absorbed into the mother's milk, nor is it resorted to orally application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are the clinical trials well-known for those undesirable disease reductions, according to system organclasses and ordered by decreasing the frequency of their appearance (very common: equal 1 / 10; &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not well-known (frequency based on the availability of availability).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-speaking, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, uncommon creation, creation or weakness, confusion, concentration of disorders, Benommenities, excessive Hunting, changes in vision, headaches, nausea and heartbeat.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodstreamphie Wird failed to switch the injecting location within the injecting range, can occur as a result of a propodystrophy on the injecting location.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemia cells with awareness can be treated by a intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a trained person, or by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">According to a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify the judgments for heavy hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by the inhibitor of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous gait occurs quickly and the work is shorter than at hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type-1-diabetes labs, insulin lulisine in the therapeutical use of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg becomes a dose disproportionately high glucose metabolism effect, and with 0,3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucose metabolism, just like Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a double as fast efficiency, as normative Humaninsulin and achieves complete glucosity effects approximately 2 hours earlier than Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was apparent that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable, ranational glycemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Was insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a better unitive control was achieved as with humanic insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin pulisin 15 minutes after the start of the meal, is a comparative glycemic control as given at human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- nuten before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at Gabe 2 minutes before the start of the meal in comparison with human normal insulin, which was 30 minutes (normal - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (normal - previously) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
