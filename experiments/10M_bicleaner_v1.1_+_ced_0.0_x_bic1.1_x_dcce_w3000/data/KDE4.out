the package &amp; package includes different modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of their small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , by making them easier available .
further information on the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
to download these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions ... open the card holder tools and select the required modules .
this is a list of standard settings from the package ; add @-@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , which contains &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for the crash , or the list of stor@@ my , if available , clear .
the module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in der &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , select the DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . as default , the display begins with the root no@@ de of the document , example : the element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root circle .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / Directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for various symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the partic@@ ul@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of portra@@ yed Ord@@ ner@@ hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportionate to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder or folder , the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is defined in it . thus , large files can be recognized even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphic and interactive version of the UNIX Basi@@ cs that you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ es @-@ presentation represents a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . to facilitate navigation , the ri@@ angles have reasonable colour @-@ finding and s@@ logging settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on screen mode , can be either a depth of the slight detection of the nest@@ ing ste@@ e or the illustration of a different file as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify whether enough space is available at all or if the area is used by sub@@ ordinate rect@@ angle ( where , consequently , you can define the relative position of the sign@@ ment in the rect@@ angle ) .
in case algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the surface should be respected that the area is proportionate to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ o in &amp; FS@@ View ; this objective is not always observed . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is quad@@ r@@ atic .
as spl@@ itting the area of an item for the sub@@ ordinate entries is left , the implementation remains up . here it is for the compl@@ ying and avoiding space loss by frame always split the surface so that rect@@ angle is created , which are as square @-@ possible . the best methods of this are rows , columns , or recur@@ sive second @-@ release .
you can specify the minimal below for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a smo@@ k@@ pattern is drawn into the area of an ordered entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the module can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under extras , create ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

a simple to @-@ use camera shop is provided to help you connect with your digital camera and convert your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ tised . of course , more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by means of library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and any card reading which is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ tised .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; contains a quick image editing with basic image processing power tools . you can use these to review and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE image plug @-@ ins ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ tization is ; easy to use , it provides d@@ utz@@ lig@@ ently professional capabilities available . it works entirely in 16 @-@ bit color and all available modules support the raw conver@@ ting using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ colour administration - work@@ flow .
improved database with much more met@@ adata about how &amp; eg ; on the camera or the lens , can be searched over .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also called &amp; digi@@ tization ; an open source project . that means it is reli@@ ant on supporting the end user . they therefore should report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ tised : attempts to make the notification of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes . if you use this link@@ age link , your web browser opens a page in the error @-@ system . all the information you require here is already registered . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ tised : is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers come to help each other . if you submit a regular users of &amp; digi@@ tization , then we would like to answer you questions on other users of &amp; digi@@ tised . however , in this mailing list , however , you should answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be mighty in this language .
you can also visit digi@@ tised : home page to find news on shared versions and other information on &amp; checking ; to learn .
the best way to start to &amp; checking , is the registration in the developer &apos;s mailing list . instructions to report in the developer &apos;s mailing list from &amp; digi@@ arrived .
if you arrived &amp; digi@@ tised ; for the first time , you will be asked where to store your images and your database . simply enter the name of a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the name of the folder , or click the folder symbol to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file will be stored . this path remains the same for all the sub@@ folders .
later , you can add as many folders as you wish to add . &amp; digi@@ tization ; will you use in addition as an Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ K@@ am setup collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images stored as the base folder . no picture is changed here . during the passage of the folder you will get a progress view like this :
&amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; thir@@ st for recur@@ sively the library path in its whole depth . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folders unless it is in a hidden folder . this can help you to add a point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as the base folder , you will notice that the albums in my all@@ list do not take pictures as symbols . you can change it by taking a any photo out of the album and then take this on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the albums .
once you have configured the root folder , you can set in &amp; check ; your digital camera set up . then you should learn how to use My albums and My key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ ei@@ Support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can also deal with it . this support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , then you will find a list of supported Roh@@ cameras in the Help Roh@@ lo@@ era@@ ise .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and ro@@ h work@@ flow .
a simple to @-@ use camera shop is provided to help you connect with your digital camera and convert your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ tised . of course , more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by means of library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and any card reading which is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ tised .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will also be realized as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be implemented via the picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ 2. used the program to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , further distribution collection for digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to machines and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port slow , this connection has been de@@ prec@@ ated by now . &amp; digi@@ tised ; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ bex@@ change support so that the thumb@@ nails will be read from digi@@ k@@ am reliably . the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to conc@@ ede anything or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ tization : is how easy it can expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE image plug @-@ in Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a joint module structure for &amp; checking ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipulate images in almost any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much simpler , &amp; digi@@ tised ; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either move the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch into full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
the pulling and drop of pictures works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the tree tree , on the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture does not appear in keywords , date list or seeking .
- a file selection allows you to release the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . so the fil@@ tering is shown on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind is shown symbols . which fields are shown you can configure in the dialog of al@@ ben@@ settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ register equ@@ ot ; provides an organized view stored on your photo@@ sets . these albums are stored in a single album tree , according to the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date , where the album was created first , the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a photo shot directly to an album . select an album impor@@ ter scre@@ enshot .
to copy or move a picture of an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and move there . in the following menu you must select whether the image is moving through moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to get information about this collection . to access the Alb@@ um@@ Properties , you must click on the album with the right mouse button and edit the right @-@ click menu features .
Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method of highlight your albums , so that you can select from a common name . the collection you select from the tool@@ bar or view albums from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the buttons oldest , average , restart : they use the date on one of the oldest , the latest image or that of the passage of the album . firstly , it is initially tried to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
if you first got an album in &amp; digi@@ tised , the first image will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ list@@ ot ; this is why the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select a different photo as a symbol .
to select a different photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button , and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . additionally you can draw the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can always be only included in a collection and collections cannot be wasted .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section of my key@@ word list below in the main window . album collections have a different effect . on the collection are always all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview window , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ ver buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time , you must wait short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this in which you can create all the thumb@@ nails .
information on each picture will be shown below the screen preview . what information this is , you can change about settings and modify them . select the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nails of your desire .
the thumb@@ nails feature help window , the ad . if you have the mouse to rest a moment on a picture . the help displays the most important properties including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the introduction into the main window displays such a help window .
photos are all , what it was included in &amp; digi@@ tised . these albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can view all the features that can preview with &amp; digi@@ tised . you can easily reach the right @-@ click menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between the be@@ holder of images , a slideshow or the editing of images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by calling either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and Edit ... select a guide on how you can edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; checking it ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by checking the context menu with the right mouse button and how you can customize this your needs if your program does not count , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that following the processing by other image processing programs can come into problems with the met@@ adata in the picture . some programs do not store these data with when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ C and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc. .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; sets two possibilities for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select shoot . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you got a photo from &amp; checking , it will be moved in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . f@@ 8 picture delete or un@@ f if you prefer really to delete , you can use this by using Shift .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the view &amp; quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My dates list@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; will organize your photos by means of the data . &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digi@@ kam ; either use the EX@@ IF @-@ date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change in the file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you select one month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et below in the calendar indication so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful possibility to organize your photos and catalogue . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this spot or a search again .
when a key@@ word is selected , all photographs marked with this key@@ word are shown .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . in this way you can arrange your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also cl@@ apping parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word list@@ ot ; to sit down so that you can find the keywords you &apos;re looking for , easily find .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and wei@@ ghted key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields . so you can use your tags also in other programs . besides , the tags at the loss of the database re @-@ imported as soon as he digi@@ tised .
you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; or on an existing key@@ word , after clicking on an existing key@@ word , after you have clicked on an existing key@@ word , this is to the sub@@ stit@@ uting of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself is not deleted . only the key@@ word will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired position in the tree and drop there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to push the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the key@@ word menu . you can edit the name of the keywords and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; change .
to select a different photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and click in the context menu as an album preview . in addition , you can draw the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
to use &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; s functionality with key@@ word can be used , you must first select your photos with keywords , you can drag them to the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word folder ; alternatively , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select from the context menu item .
you can display a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be shown as soon as you select one of keywords for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was done so etc .
once you have provided a picture with key@@ word , it will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word right click with the right button of the menu and select from the keywords menu . the menu displays you only the keywords which have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time depending on the number of images per time unit . a selection framework can be moved across this hist@@ o@@ gram . to select a time@@ frame , you only need to click the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame which gives the time unit . thus , all the corresponding pictures will appear in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more .
Neb@@ el@@ er search box is a small lamp the green becomes when the search takes place . if you click here , the fil@@ tering will be deleted and all pictures again displayed . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp becomes red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ t . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a search crit@@ erion , which always fil@@ tered you as a search crit@@ erion . after you saved it was published a filter at the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be done . the text box are used in the main window . the text box store is used to select your request a name in My search list , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View Pur@@ search list and select an option in his context menu .
if you are looking for editing , the form to enter the search returns with the previous search information . if you want to edit an advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for finding . further information can be found in section The tool for Advanced search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search .
the Exten@@ ded search makes you an expanded search form with many search parameters for you to search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tised ; s database can be found .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules may be added , separated by operators . each option can link with other over the logical operations All ... , A ... , no ... or At least ... we can link up the type &amp; quot ; AND NIC@@ HT@@ Y ; create .
&amp; digi@@ tised : character@@ izes each picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two image sig@@ natures , the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture . by means of a swelling can be enlarged or reduced . if you push an image from somewhere over the symbol of un@@ precise search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : open @-@ hand color sketch : record a fast sketch and &amp; digi@@ tization : find the appropriate pictures . also here can be a spon@@ ge value .
this rider represents an intuitive ticket search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature . you can drag it into a square with the mouse wheel . push C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse kno@@ b to pull a square . all images inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this places your pictures Ge@@ o @-@ data included .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ came ; makes a light table available in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em Light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light menu and open its window . if you &apos;re back in &amp; digi@@ tised , main@@ window , you can open the lumin@@ tic fast with L extras .
out of the thumb@@ nails , you can see the pictures you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . if you can preview synchron@@ ize the tool@@ bar and execute zoo or sliding operations at one of the pictures , then they will also be executed with the other image .
another mode is better suited to pick up quickly from a picture series . if you use pa@@ ar@@ wise out of the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will automatically display in the areas to the subject . use the left mouse button to display it in the right area . this is simplified through a series of similar pictures to work .
of course , the normal holes are also working directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the lower end of each range , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel feature , which you swing to the crossed arrows . to flip the visible area of the picture , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in case Preview will then show both pictures in the same picture .
the zo@@ om works as well as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom sli@@ der under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel around into the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode of Preview .
what is a digital inventory - apart from the issue ? digital inventory is viewed each part of the process after the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos recorded , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we provide you with a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to use your pictures , protect , protect and re @-@ use photos . we look at the procedure for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ tization . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , secure , group@@ ed , valu@@ ing , archiving , upgrading , and export from images .
&amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale inventory is based on inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , seek , transforming , ready @-@ assembled , and exports content that have a mon@@ edi@@ tary or cultural value .
met@@ adata is defined as data on data . met@@ adata is available in accordance with your definition data to provide information about or a documentation of other data , which are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you can find out more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t even know how much photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t know &amp; digi@@ tised . . the approach the met@@ adata can be saved in both a database and in the image files guaranteed very fast seeking and a secure archiving to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and need to know anything about your system is to build information structure unlike the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide whether other access to your photos may have to store or on a network drives &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found via your location . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant access of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % working files have become and you will then not want to re @-@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking is easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simplify a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you &apos;re looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the met@@ adata option to activate in the settings of met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ tization . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently be saved the met@@ adata from the database to the files by selecting the corresponding item on the menu item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? it asks and digi@@ tised , to them an met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now , the real work , since you should now select each photo of keywords , signs and evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value . you start best with the rating or the ranking . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos .
let &apos;s now let us with key@@ word , keywords , as you are often called in other programs , or categories continue . all three are syn@@ ony@@ me for the same thing .
if you import cataly@@ zed images from a different source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ tised ; automatically insert the tree for you or put the pictures to the right place . the re@@ sort of hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply drag through the tree of a sub @-@ tree to another . the modified keywords will be replaced by &amp; digi@@ tised ; updated while the under@@ trees pro@@ secuted .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata exists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section relates to labelling or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata .
you want to see most anyone your photos simply , they want to share with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in how your photos will arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start seeing some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so , the marking has changed your perception of this panor@@ amas .
for others who look at the title is probably more important than the image themselves to create an interest . if you show images , you should tell a story . remember the key it is the meaning to the viewer to help Him through the motif you move has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect , if it has the strength to act solely with a marking for himself .
with &amp; digi@@ tised , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . why you can even export your pictures to your wishes in the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery . you have to tell the story for the opening @-@ colors no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in a different city without the navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now begins with light speed .
the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ k@@ alization are already un@@ coun@@ table and will be deeper into the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can export your journeys by pictures with geographical data . you can also export the photos at the reception . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and calls the practice to use the copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , thus also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the furnishing page of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; when information should be deposited :
the author ( Syn@@ ony@@ ms and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person that has created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , such as the name of a company or organisation , it should no longer be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author ( syn@@ onym for editor ) : linked to the author . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . as this is a reference to the author &apos;s field , this must be filled out also .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . if the photographer works for a message agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency will be shown here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ pros , this protection is very important to this .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ tization : will be available such a module for st@@ acker in the near future .

of course we are not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section they are about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data collection in the world , has some interesting statistics , which reasons why a loss of data has .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be cautious for longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also get CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe that is in your Er@@ mess@@ en@@ playground .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discs and good recording equipment and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable . it is therefore about choosing the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect itself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control . despite this massive protection they are used by chemical aging , ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scratch , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to do wonders on CDs and DVDs . however , there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to win the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good reception on high quality media in a non propri@@ ated format . if you read the media with a description , date &amp; author , and then on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected place . don &apos;t forget the data to copy the next generation of hardware or software that can read this media .
dis@@ car@@ makers reserve your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s rooms will include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents on this subject a large field study on the error mechanisms of HDDs : Dis@@ faul@@ ty study
in brief : strikes hold the longest if you are operated in the temper@@ ament area of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . electronic parts of the Contro@@ llers are the common@@ est fault of error , SM@@ ART may not notice the fault of this error . these are in particular read@@ mill and publishing t@@ ellers . the expected lifetime period is between 4 and 5 years .
this is just the loss of loss due to tension . of course , you can also make data loss due to electricity if you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be made without any major problems .
while most electrical devices do not account much , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es were blocked , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ations , expe@@ di@@ ted mother@@ boards , and other def@@ ective . so protect yourself from the un@@ avoidable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against rap@@ port is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absorbed part of the energy @-@ load and the rest occurs . it is usually available in the form of a single @-@ line bar . however , remember that not every St@@ ec@@ ker@@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting it against lightning stroke and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable is used to use your computer , you should be careful that also all peri@@ pher@@ als connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protective devices that also contain a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable and TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable install@@ ment protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for the road .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even an accident of few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile electricity supply .
aside from the protection against over@@ tension these devices can provide automatically cordless energy when a power out@@ age occurs . some models allow them to store your data and re @-@ run the system . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the living time of the battery and the attached software is interesting .
concern the potential risk , exposed to your computer system and compare your safety with electricity disorders using the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you keep in mind how well your computer protects it . at the end you should always think all the cable trendy before you go to holidays .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are compared to the HDDs , but very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost / dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution . however , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . the professional variant gives you more available , in case of Flickr dramatic more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality only .
from the point of view of the backup data , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically processed thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies is included in the offer a backup and shares of memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ly .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all broad@@ casts are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs do not at least ensure the data integr@@ ations between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ detected by you one day , and it &apos;s quite disturbing that there should be no protection inside your computer . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data track than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission losses as they generate interference within the data flows . with normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates , which can be circum@@ s@@ able with turn@@ table errors and is highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patients and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that are used and is also available for Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the notebook and 46 % in job systems . with not@@ ebooks , the percentage of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or re@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sighted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal better than EX@@ T@@ 3 , rout@@ ing , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the broad@@ sheet file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and loss of data : wrong , just the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an in@@ defin@@ ately status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : incorrect , theft and human errors are the major causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural border for this advancement . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 me@@ ap@@ i@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality op@@ tics , the optimum size of 6 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel and high quality op@@ tics are the Optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for loss loss . so , so your data is often affected by a loss of data . so secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do anything , like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates , or the size of your hard disk .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster proposes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft un@@ happiness : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the complete house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ str@@ action also means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the staircase , into the neighboring building , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a frequent reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files saved . it is a snapshot of history without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference security : a backup of the files changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of at two time points : the total security of the system and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental security : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . they can produce the original status at any time when such a backup was made . this backup comes up to a version@@ ing system next to the exception that it is only off @-@ off and is not permanent .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file trans@@ criptions copies r@@ sync only the difference of files that really were changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or any other optical medium .
this procedure allows you to discover losses and restore it . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of work files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month . any further discharge should be done manually after you have made a complete review .
themes : met@@ adata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , storage , scal@@ ability , media , play@@ back of images and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you are really interested in you because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature is un@@ predictable , you must consider all that is said today . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain vigil@@ ance . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is back@@ wards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switching to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means growing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift to a new record :
check with the command d@@ m@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it .
/ dev / s@@ d@@ c # source code / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the record in MB@@ LES ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , fat@@ 16 , 32 and re@@ iron &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ iron if necessary
open Source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read more , then you can create it yourself . this task will become easier by year to year .
gif is a proprietary , patented format slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source Standard developed by the G@@ IF . however , it can be loss , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and Chro@@ m@@ esh data for improved color reference for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and a slow @-@ use compression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your images .
TI@@ FF was widely used as picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss of free comp@@ ut@@ ations ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , it is very large files . with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types of cameras .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open @-@ format @-@ format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is required to use met@@ adata . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon it at some time .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why , to replace 2001 , Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer the original size of your recording , mostly in the shell format , to archive data . however , there can be problems in the link between the met@@ adata and the image file , and as mentioned above , the shell format will fail . therefore , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , offering a wide range of applications and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard meetings and enligh@@ tened efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reading or the scanner . so long the images on the camera are available , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a subtle process , you can use external programs . if you use the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tised , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut in some circumstances from the other programs .
protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then into web galleries , code you into MPEG , use in contact leaf@@ lets , print them &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tised . in the add of a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them to the machine , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a Finish indicator is available at the lower end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will display . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file access for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera appear .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an item or met@@ adata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information that is internally downloaded from the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . please note that some digital cameras do not provide all the information .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. in the picture . this information is the same as in met@@ adata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tised ; or the image processing . please note that these met@@ adata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from her camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ tised . after downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired option with the default options available by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download Sel@@ ected . the box selected can be downloaded until you selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is new to download . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ tised . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you choose to download or download the buttons , a dialog with which you can select the target album , in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown as normal folder , then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you chose the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tised ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by delete the delete button . if you only want to delete a few , then you must select it first and delete them for delete them .
note that there is no way for photos to recover from the camera . so the photos will not be deleted in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; so they should carefully check if the photos may delete them from the camera . if you don &apos;t want to delete them from the camera . if you don &apos;t want to delete the camera record , this is much faster .
cameras use as a file name for the photos frequently not particularly expres@@ sive name . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually res@@ trained after the photos from the camera . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time when the picture was taken to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirror @-@ based sub@@ folders . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three additional options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different medium @-@ format than standard format , for example in the processing field , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % discount - % M : % S . change the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ am@@ time .
when you use the camera file name , you will have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters . or in large letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , which the camera came ; for a photo , it is shown below the name , which provides the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ ame are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time @-@ point of recording . not all cameras are ready to install this information . in the page side@@ bar met@@ adata you can read more details , about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic turning turn , use the button Advanced and select the Autom@@ atic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera records information about the date on which the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ tised . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras will provide this information . in the side@@ bar met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually shut off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ tization ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change it , you must turn this option . use the button Advanced and select there the option @-@ based shelter at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to download photos of your computer to their camera is the button Download . then select the upload dialog box . you can select the files up@@ loaded , you can select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the selection is completed , asks &amp; digi@@ tization ; you , where the images are to be up@@ loaded . a folder @-@ selection dialog appears for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to load the up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position that is indicated in long@@ itude and lati@@ tude and can be displayed on a map . identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographs can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to rein@@ car@@ p an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can easily access a browser which indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tised , user want to locate the place of the photos , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , Satt@@ el@@ ites and card refer@@ ences are supported . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ asset Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you have to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of hairy coordinates created , e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com does not show European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ tization : try to give you as much control over his work@@ flows . there are many attitudes which have the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tised . to adjust to these settings , you must log in into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
action may be able to display on embedded preview or image editing . so they place the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ tised ; if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , when the option is selected when downloading the camera registry . also with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Autor@@ titel is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should be the professional photographer of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the author , this also must be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to specify the picture of the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is a bearing agency , such as Re@@ uters , or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be registered here , then the group or agency that the image will be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this makes the met@@ adata permanently available in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tised . these met@@ adata also are available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tised ; they will be imported without losing .
images described as embedded cap@@ tures ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you &apos;ve embedded in the pictures , with the images embedded in the pictures . thus , you can also include signs of images , these have already been written by those of &amp; digi@@ tised .
the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear if the pointer is displayed in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tised ; supports a number of different image formats , and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ tised . to specify , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove it . Alb@@ any folder that has no one of these extensions will be ignored by &amp; digi@@ tised .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Re@@ fresh on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ous of &amp; digi@@ tised ; it can be switched on this page to the default values . however , some images do not have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole size @-@ type quot ; should you only use on quick calcul@@ ators . if you have one , then you can hereby obtain better results .
by default , the image editing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use the image editing in full @-@ screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker and bri@@ ghter color in the image . these colors will be defined here . in the picture editing this picture can be converted with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and turned off .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the pictures are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia about further explanation .
with the setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation is reduced not the image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss of free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value to a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TI@@ FF files compressed you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compression for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm used loss @-@ free .
with the attitude of loss @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can cut loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tised , the image processing was only a picture viewing for photos . currently it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the standard ann@@ ame is that all green pixels are identical . if the line @-@ up green pixel of the C@@ CD sensor can react when pixels with odd lines , this option creates a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details , but the 2@@ x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ pattern comes with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white sand is not removed . standard is it a fixed color balance , based on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting will be supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps will get more details into the cutting edge . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is it the cutting @-@ edge so the parts of your images are burned down , because of the in@@ ability of your camera records the cutting @-@ edge , as op@@ ting white @-@ white results . lastly , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the cutting edge .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as quick as green and red . &amp; digi@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixel . of course , this is a question of how much color or wh@@ ites you want .
when you re@@ construct the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be adapted for each picture separately .
put the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ance to your liking . you probably need to put it slightly higher than the default 1 . but this can also be done later in the picture options of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ B@@ icing small , you should proceed conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to convert a complete image from the partial data @-@ data that have many cameras and which is available for a Matrix colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ pa@@ h ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it generates farmers in edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result .
if you know the color @-@ sof@@ tening of your lenses , you can put the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color error correction , since it is carried out during the pipe .
a profile translated the color formations and gives instructions like this again should be given . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tised . information like the color information from a color to the other are to be translated as accurately as possible .
behaviour questions , if an image is opened in the image processing / colour administration module with Roh@@ files .
color profile Set@@ ting you here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tised ; studies this folder then during the start of the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have the opportunity &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed while opening the raw file later .
the colour administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your pictures rather than the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to the camera manufacturer and model that you are using . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain the color @-@ tone or Gam@@ ma@@ correc@@ tions . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not required for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depths . this means you have to perform the color @-@ tone itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile where you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print picture since your printer can be a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore highly satisfied . this could you manually correct instead of leaving the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that the colour profile is intended for them for what is meant . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ officially :
the Canon profile extends the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; picture viewing and image work@@ ings supported ; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select which you want to use and these modules will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ tised . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context @-@ click menu .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can set in the menu under settings short commands .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slides should be easy to understand . the upper reg@@ istrar j@@ us@@ hes the time between the cap@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other h@@ ubs put the met@@ adata or , which at the lower end of the images appears during display .
the camera properties show on the left side a list of all cameras . on the right hand side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to identify the camera properly , switched on and in picture @-@ line mode . among them are the portfolios . currently here are the serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage devices .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras from the camera date . you have to specify the path , / m@@ esh / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ posit@@ ories where you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tised , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them into the display mode .
try out if &amp; checking it ; the camera automatically recognises . if not , you can set cam@@ am@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after you have installed your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this will display in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option of confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; images in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can view the talk of &amp; digi@@ tised ; in del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the portions of a photo and del@@ eting a album you will find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can still be used by &amp; digi@@ tised ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you must use the changes with the button changes .
you can also view the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ tised . at the start of the start , this speeds up under circumstances the starting process of &amp; digi@@ tised .
the setting of Bei@@ m starts searching for new photos &amp; digi@@ tised , to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this prolon@@ gs the time folder &amp; digi@@ tised . if something was deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ come ; you , whether it is to delete them from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tised ; in order to adjust the main window to your liking . these settings can be selected using settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is counted below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for digi@@ tised , you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; contains a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the posting ads / editing .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tised . therefore , they are not part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in the picture editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file size , enlar@@ ging the size and the current size shows .
a menu bar on the top edge and below the tool@@ bar to access the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image processing changes your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save it to save the button save from the tool@@ bar . please note that you can no longer re@@ vert the original photo once you saved the picture .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file saving .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the file name file or use the button Rest@@ ore Rest@@ oration in the tool@@ bar . you will lose any change that you have done at the photo since the last time .
virtually any action of the image processing can be und@@ one or recovered . the last action you can re@@ vert by choosing mach@@ ining or re@@ inst@@ ated by choosing mach@@ ining from the menu .
if you often use this , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to return and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ S@@ um@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can press a moment longer via the return menu or re @-@ manufacture button in tool@@ bar , you will get a right @-@ click menu . if you select one of the menu items , all the actions in between are also und@@ one or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu . if you have any changes in the current photo , you will ask if you want to save it .
you can get in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the log menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view full @-@ screen mode shows the photo in full @-@ screen mode . you come in the normal view , in which you use the Es@@ cape key . normally , you can change this in the setting dialog of &amp; digi@@ tised . this allows you to view this in the setting dialog of &amp; digi@@ tised . you can view this from &amp; digi@@ tised . see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the menu File print and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; printing dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print some pictures or whole sets . whole image boards can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Ex@@ c@@ unt printing . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ball ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navig@@ ational pair , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is clicked on :
multi@@ f@@ aches Click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
in the s@@ way view , you can enter c@@ tures with unlimited size or insert . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the sign@@ ments are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters will be formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC code field in other applications , you should note these limitations .
after you have commented on , use either the button or simply switch to the next image , the sign@@ posts are then stored .
besides the apply button , there is a button which can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata to the files . however , this will always be done if you have a met@@ adata adjustment that is always written in the pictures .
the review reveals an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the side@@ bar is always used only to one image . to select multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field . co@@ ding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the keywords shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keywords , and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; check ;
the keywords will be dynam@@ ically adjusted to the word password . you can limit the number of options in finding a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief in entering key@@ word at a picture series . if you typ@@ ed different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set through marking the appropriate att@@ ach@@ s in the tree . all words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
when multiple images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the keywords , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not on the whole selection , If you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please refer to the key@@ word filter section .
the side@@ bar point filter is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and view@@ points . if in addition one or more key@@ word filter is used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all keywords are available .
you can also pull out tags and drop it . suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view , so you can drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then , a dialog that you asks if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the top example , the main window displays the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the key@@ word filter stands on no sampling , which reduces the amount of three images . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a and then a key@@ word was drawn from the right key@@ word on the selection and asked there . a dialogue asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
these search for changes will take place at every start of the program . it can also be turned under settings Miscellaneous .
if you have a rule and have created and realize that it should be one or be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry to which is sought after in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database .
you can set a Exten@@ ded search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you wish to group options , you only need the cross box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . these options see as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free disk space is limited there to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in the full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly made it on &amp; digi@@ tised ; s specific implementation may be adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed work@@ flow , the colours used by your camera or scanner come from the actually photographed and sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed work@@ flow , you can reach that the colors click on your monitor to those of your camera or scanner , and that the colours you print or publish in the web from your digital dark@@ room .
when the subject comes to color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the outcomes he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color administration . additionally you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your image work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ GB @-@ color @-@ bro@@ ws . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image spending are by email or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is .
so if the R@@ GB works so well and life is so easy for everyone , why should one use another color @-@ bro@@ w and have to make your thoughts about colour @-@ administr@@ ations ?
a visual example of the lim@@ b of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can truly see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ular region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB color , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimension@@ ed representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excell@@ ente page and click on information About R@@ GB Working So@@ aces .
do I have to cold my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ GB of color ?
yes ! whether you are working in the R@@ GB R@@ GB work or not , you have to al@@ locate your monitor . so the calcul@@ ating of your monitor includes the circle . if you are working as compared to the R@@ GB , you need to either use your monitor on the R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual work .
the functions norm@@ alize , capture , automatic , and contrast elev@@ ating the menu cor@@ rigi@@ er automatic correction try automatically to make the best of your colors . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method will scale the lumin@@ osity value through the entire image , so the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without its color gra@@ dations . this function is often a magnet correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
the same : this method used the ligh@@ tening factor of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ o@@ gram of the intention is as flat as possible . thus , the comparison has yiel@@ ding very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces garbage . it is a very powerful operation which can either do wonders in an image or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic de@@ activation : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green@@ - and blue @-@ channel . they determine the dark and bright side @-@ sounds and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green@@ - and blue @-@ channels to complete hist@@ o@@ grams .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by changing the lowest and highest values in the widest possible area and a new output of all values in between . this is only visible in washed up images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white cut off &amp; checking out ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
the white @-@ like correction is slightly limited as over a color @-@ bit with 8 @-@ bit per color . in case you can perform too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure . in case you can carry the white down@@ stream in the shell mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities will be better for correction .
this tool is based on a white down@@ gra@@ ff@@ mus which is copyri@@ ghted by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they launch him about the menu @-@ entry colors white off the image processing .
the window display can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side are both the original image and the preview of the target picture . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original box right again , it is enough to click the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target picture features a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ator of the pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ gram .
on the right above is a hist@@ o@@ gram displayed as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ o@@ gram is very helpful there , even in well lighted images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ator values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ator .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , sati@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade will be able to improve the shadow details of your photos or be down .
An@@ stat with the above controls to play around , you should use the color @-@ temperature p@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the thumb@@ nail to use the color for the calculation of the color @-@ temperature of the white @-@ bla@@ ze . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white straight away with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indication is increasing the colors , when more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . it will be shown the combined result in the white @-@ button . this will be shown as a pure indicator and does not have an effect on the final picture .
buttons are saving and charging exactly this . each setting of the white bla@@ ze you have set you can save it in a text file and then load again later .
the button pres@@ ets puts all the filter values back to its standard values and the neutral white @-@ bla@@ ze . keep in mind that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you store this , your original image is changed .
you can set here the co@@ di@@ caps per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this enco@@ ding requires also more turn@@ tables , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialogue as for the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color pro@@ fil@@ ings . colour settings can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can draw in the chapter color administration .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors of sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to use several color channels at the same time , so that you can always make use of them for multiple images . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same correction . in the manual for the sound correction , you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors of gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool Far@@ ou@@ ff@@ ings makes you four color effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ ine filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar pol@@ arization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of a short flash by the additional light . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illum@@ ination . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to fin@@ alize this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar pol@@ arization . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase in ultimately generates a neg@@ ativity that so not to create phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a sati@@ ation that it makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes colors brilliant and smooth . try it simple , he em@@ bell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a light @-@ optimised colour movie made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ gr@@ . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in day@@ light and high contrasts . however , the characteristics also make it a few photographs , especially those that are scar@@ ed landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast @-@ edge . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . with great pictures the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color contr@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu . all your adju@@ sting can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the results you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you get a picture of bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a great choice for brightness / satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will be able to increase . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lamp @-@ strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool of sound @-@ correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue is very complicated for this tool , you need only the area of sh@@ ale . concrete , the three sliding on below the hist@@ o@@ gram .
the window contains a graphs of intention , a hist@@ o@@ gram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graphs are three sli@@ ders into the inside and which can be moved to change the intention of the image . the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and take care of how the image changes .
on the right hand side , the original and the preview of the image can be considered . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the settings of the image . on the left are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ o@@ gram is presented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic axis . for pictures of a digital camera , linear hist@@ o@@ gram is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the arith@@ mic hist@@ o@@ gram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic setting will be useful .
three Reg@@ ulators : the top for the dark tones , the mean for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ ids .
the three color @-@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image to add the input of the shade , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is one button for full automatic alignment .
extracts : the ga@@ ards allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two Reg@@ ulators that can be used to change the exec@@ ut@@ ors as well as in the input . the compression of the ga@@ watts can be used for example to create a hidden picture as a background while something else is to be seen as a background .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
save as and loading : with these buttons , the default values are stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . in addition , the Gimp level format is used .
if you are using this mode and the three color chains , the input data is automatically used for all shadows , medium and sun @-@ sounds . activate the color box you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for the en@@ act@@ ment of the hist@@ o@@ grams for red , green@@ - , blue and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ee channels .
the over@@ exposure indication indicator controls all the colour channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see in the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the procedures applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the ex@@ termin@@ ations are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original is displayed as well as the target picture . the thumb@@ nails will be refres@@ hed depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the module that is changed by the module :
beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of sensory mode . for pictures with large areas of constant color creates the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help further .
if you move on the right to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds can be correspon@@ ded with darker exhau@@ sts and that the corresponding picture pixel will be darker .
on the preview of the original photograph is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ er to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is j@@ us@@ hed to your liking .
save as and store : using these buttons , you can do exactly this . any curve that you have created can be stored in fil@@ esystem and can be loaded later . file format for this is the Gimp cam format .
if you want this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ets buttons , you automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sunny . activate the color box you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red , green@@ - , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the over@@ exposure indication indicator controls all paint channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . here it is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see in the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white picture , which has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ant canal . shadow and sunny sounds are placed with the colour p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos .
the canal @-@ bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image editing .
you can select the color for the hist@@ o@@ gram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the original area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target picture has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ gram appears to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you also activate L@@ umin@@ ator , the image @-@ bl@@ ender then activate the tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , that does not appear at the same point in the color channel and whose smoking pattern is different in each channel differently . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ g@@ conversion in which you reduced the bul@@ let first .
the store as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mix@@ er setting can you save for later and then load . it used file format is the Gimp channel bl@@ ender format .
the over@@ exposure indication indicator controls all the colour channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see in the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been converted . the L@@ umin@@ ator option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always intrigu@@ ing about your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photographs , black / White is a step of work , as color images can simply be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ ers profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford D@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super
green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure to a green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good at all the scenery and fits very well to portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange fil@@ tered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure to a orange lime filter . this improves landscape , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) oran@@ fil@@ ter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film expos@@ ing with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates hor@@ cel@@ estial effect and can simul@@ ate moon @-@ face to day @-@ time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) rot@@ filter .
yel@@ lowing filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure to a yellow lime filter . this is the most natural dy@@ e lens and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm bright and middle tones while he adds a bit cold in the chim@@ ney . this is very similar to the process of the appearance of a pressure and re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ scho@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and with it similar to the 00@@ 5 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool texture can apply decorative textures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged score , or as a wall image on a wall . the menu effect image apply the image processing can be used for it .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of the depth and tri@@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper text system has been applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ eder ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add an image .
keeping the eye of a spect@@ ator in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the eye view . under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you place the desired type of body for your image . consistently , the image with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce embr@@ aces it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button @-@ feathers and decorative stit@@ uting a zi@@ pper frame with patterns .
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is from 1 % to 50 % limited .
the target frame will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture in any place . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text color , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sighted background . already the picture is ready .
any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &apos; OK &apos; . after the picture was saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when checking out the tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool , you can apply a template using one image . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the menu image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be used in the image processing can be used to show sten@@ cils over an image . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of file size of the template . if you want to add your template with maximum compression ( 9 ) , just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ tised , mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to insert your template folder with the kno@@ b folder . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder was set for the sten@@ cils , a tree @-@ view , which reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ abl@@ on@@ en@@ ord@@ ner . selecting a folder is updated the thumb@@ nails of the sten@@ cils automatically .
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button is magni@@ fied the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ine : this button reduced the underlying picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the full image , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . do the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically be adapted to the pres@@ cient size .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; sets three different tools to ac@@ ut@@ eness . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but generates particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ined images .
in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it does not work a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric agents , and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it &apos;s copyri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the edge . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digital pictures need a correction of shar@@ pen@@ ing . elements that are smaller than the resolution will therefore be combined into a common color together . that &apos;s the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually need more down@@ stream than normal cameras for private users .
with JP@@ EG images it is often applied to a camera internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the shell @-@ format , however , must always be mel@@ ted during the processing .
some scanner uses a focal filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable them , you get control of your image .
in some situations you may get usable results by calling a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing value . that allows you to call with the menu application cor@@ rigi@@ er sharp@@ ens .
you should however deal with caution because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but reinforced also the smoking . in general , the most suitable technology for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image can re@@ focus on the tool . below re@@ focus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to paint the picture a little soft , is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft@@ ness with the menu application cor@@ rigi@@ dly and experiment with something with settings . the window display on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter blur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and the preview can help edit the image . the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . default values produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius , or the amount reinforce the effect . if you create the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask , smoke det@@ ectors and the impression of ridge in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of a channel through the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ os . they therefore should raise images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the shar@@ pen@@ ed is set .
the Corpor@@ a value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and to the applicable difference . one can thus define a minimum difference in order for an edge of filter . in this way areas with a soft change between the killing of shar@@ pen@@ ed and hence beauty errors in faces , Himm@@ ler and water surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur masculine filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ cot was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a Corpor@@ a = 0.@@ 0 .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; tool re@@ focus is focused on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected open @-@ filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to re@@ vert a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focus quot ; in which it is a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a sharp@@ ness mask . you can start it out of the menu by calling colours re@@ focus in the image processing .
in practice , the circular flows works much better than the gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the F@@ IR &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads far from the source pixel , which is far from the original pixel , which is far influenced by the remote pixel . the causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular thread . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should result 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very blur@@ red then however on hal@@ ves .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the diamond filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful . if the det@@ ector is too low . if the smoke filter is too low . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still further conce@@ aled .
gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed gau@@ ge is . in most cases , you should let this value be 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value in@@ equal to zero , you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the smo@@ ker filter .
note size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix code can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular shar@@ pen@@ ed edge or the gau@@ ge &apos;s edge . please note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you have placed will thus be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cuts , color and Inten@@ sive cli@@ ques on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that lots of operations that are not immediately visible immediately , but later left un@@ pleas@@ ar@@ te@@ facts .
if you read pictures and comp@@ ress ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally produces blur@@ red mas@@ king produce better results as sharp@@ ens . this could be caused to bl@@ ur the bl@@ ur mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ens .
theoretically , blur@@ red mas@@ king must produce ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it is never able to remove the effect of un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed . for the Vienna Fil@@ ters one can show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better when editing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was done with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ed correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the reg@@ ler smoo@@ th@@ tte puts the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of the area that was bl@@ acked in order to generate a natural sequ@@ el P@@ up@@ ille .
the coloring enables a customized paint for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove the desired ar@@ te@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the inser@@ tion algorithm has been developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are included below :
if you want to use the filter settings , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail @-@ keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smoo@@ th@@ tte over the picture . wo@@ es against bigger values mainly homo@@ geneous regions and details . a value of 0.@@ 9 should provide details so that no shar@@ pen@@ alties necessary is necessary . please note that the details of the details should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
rip @-@ dependent Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes even@@ ly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie bas@@ kets or C@@ CD Rau@@ l will produce a high value wav@@ eable patterns . JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts are best made with a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ .@@ p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smoo@@ th@@ ed , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effects it must be set higher than 3 .
repetition : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually , here is 1 or 2 .
angle @-@ wide since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is chosen , there should also be small chosen . make sure that small angle to create a long term . thus , you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de ( 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de @-@ wide in pixel . you should put the value of less 1 to avoid Sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : this selection of quality you can receive by selecting this option is only small . he doubles its term . we therefore recommend it to allow him to leave him .
buttons are saving as and charging exactly this . any adjustment of picture errors can be saved in a text file and can be loaded later .
graphical errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however it can still last very long and have a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can see how picture errors to be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied at a photo that was caused in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see there is an autonomous arti@@ fact that caused by a bad movie storage during the trip ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to cut images . it uses a copyri@@ ghted algorithm used by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter available to remove patches and other ar@@ te@@ facts , for example from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mos@@ is ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on sensor@@ im@@ itation of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will need only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can be blur@@ red . the area indicated by the radius , moves over the image and the color in it will be smoo@@ thes and hence minor bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the edge of the shar@@ pen@@ ing . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ le to determine the lumin@@ ous changes . you may need to re@@ count the edges , if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter images can no longer get preserved and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs .
edges : controls the cant@@ onal accuracy for the shar@@ pen@@ ed . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not be the entire noise away or smoking tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove an vigil@@ ant smoking or JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ osity of the picture . we recommend you either color or light@@ ness to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ th@@ ment process of the details settings .
color : controls the colour @-@ tolerant of the picture . we recommend to you either color or light@@ ness to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process of controlled by the details settings .
Gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ intolerance of the picture . this value can be used to raise the toler@@ ances of the darker ranges , which are typically stronger , but also the shadow areas too .
absorption : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive fil@@ tering can occur when it is too high , can cause noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at edges . it can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at edges . it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how smoking rates can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive with ( 2 ) marked with standard settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to paint the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharp@@ ens . use this tool for soft@@ ness with the menu application cor@@ rigi@@ dly and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the window display on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce Photo@@ ar@@ te@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts of your images . it is very well adapted to gau@@ ge &apos;@@ istic noise , movie gran@@ der , compres@@ ses and local errors that arise in digital , original or subsequently digital pictures . thus , the smoo@@ thing takes place along the picture cont@@ ours and thereby receives the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text composition . the text translation is performed with a different tool , the image error correction , performed . the algorithm for restoration was developed by IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ con@@ ia and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of discomfort &amp; quot ; ar@@ te@@ facts ; - small standards that are reflected in un@@ zi@@ pped image . this attitude will correct these problems .
buttons are saving as and charging exactly this . each setting of picture restoration can be saved in a text file and can be loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still last very long and have a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can reduce as a photo with uni@@ form@@ id@@ able noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous movie bas@@ tion on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photograph that was used with a scanner . you can see the scan of scan that was caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo paper . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ come ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows to remove Hot@@ pixel of photos with a C@@ CD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG Pi@@ xi project which are copyri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ ens .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially high @-@ quality white @-@ screen photos a problem , since many cameras have with JP@@ EG compression to have a built @-@ in print for hot pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name is pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lumin@@ ous pix@@ el@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a photo with an dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the kno@@ b . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you can take the dark picture directly into the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by C@@ CD def@@ ective .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel . please note that the wiz@@ ard is the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next meeting .
the picture area and the preview can help you correct within the image to correct the result . the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are taken out in all advantages .
choose an area to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select then the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it is identified an average of the neighbor pixel . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pix@@ el@@ block , are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default movie method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are pulled to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ ic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction to a color foto , from a def@@ ec@@ ed digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; vig@@ net@@ ting error is a tool in order to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. sub@@ expos@@ ing corners , an image to correct .
further angle @-@ lenses , particularly the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the whole sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ ones may show under circumstances also this behavior .
but it also has cons . many Center filters need one factor 1.5 or 2 in the bl@@ iss@@ or filter which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . far @-@ angle lenses should , also use with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ wind @-@ effects emerge through motion .
with the big expos@@ ing areas of today &apos;s film and color @-@ making use by digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by construc@@ ting an equi@@ val@@ ents transformation in a structural filter that is applied without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correctly is applied with a C@@ enter@@ filter . the algorithm is copyri@@ ghted by John Walker .
with three controllers you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of lighting absorption at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2.@@ 0 , resulting in an optical filter with a bl@@ ending setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , incre@@ mentally , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degree of vig@@ net@@ ting .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma @-@ settings : the editing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you have to re@@ vert the exposure of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ator will only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a subtle new judicial to the exposure of the target picture , so let the values for the lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; checking ; image editing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contradiction correction is also performed in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Lin@@ king distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses a copyri@@ ghted algorithm used by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gra@@ des treats the general geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ exe form of the picture .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar round @-@ effect , fla@@ p but at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient Gra@@ des corrected the distant corners opposite to that of the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two can be virtually eliminated each geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second Gra@@ des . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected , and positive values so@@ ckets .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of fourth counts . this value acts stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the revers@@ ed sign of the parameter fixed .
z@@ oom : this value scale the size and thus leads the correction first engra@@ ver . negative values grow while positive the image is smaller .
bright : this value j@@ us@@ hes the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values next to the next start .
the ton@@ gs or ho@@ ver@@ shaped correction should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes . best , you perform this correction as all first . in case you cut a picture new and then carry a ton@@ ed correction , the effect is obvious of fal@@ se@@ hood .
to help you find the best correction to you , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it into an important place , such as the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . following the connection you can correct the ton@@ e / pad with the help of the lines correct .
if you correct a pad @-@ shaped distor@@ tion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can trans@@ verse these with the cutting tool in the menu Transform@@ ations to remove from the image processing or through the z@@ oom Reg@@ ulators of this dialog .
for most images , the tone @-@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some motives like e.g. shots from the front , frame and paintings is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ si@@ le correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate an infrar@@ ed movie of the g@@ imp@@ guru movie . the filter produces the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrar@@ ed movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
beneath the preview you can set two parameters gra@@ ins and cinem@@ at@@ ability ( ISO ) . activate the option insert movie gran@@ ul@@ arity . the ISO Reg@@ ler changes the amount of movie bas@@ tion and domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green fields are white as snow !
as the filter channels supplement to the re@@ producing of infrar@@ ed film , especially the green channel , it makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos since the color formations are missing .
this is an example of infrar@@ ed filters applied to a landscap@@ ing from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture under ( 2 ) . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the cutting edge .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter movies is a simple to use tool to reproduce movies on your images . this is from classic high @-@ speed films like the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensi@@ tiveness of the films , the manufacturers mix great silver @-@ bas@@ ins of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion .
the movie body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to postp@@ one the past back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , so you need to use this filter .
with regul@@ ator the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the bas@@ kets . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 2@@ 400 . if you need even more Kör@@ ner , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of cinem@@ atics effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied meaning ( 2 ) . the most used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tised : filter oil paintings produced the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tised : filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush @-@ size between one and five out . thicker brus@@ hes are ideal for large pictures . smooth brush controls the smoo@@ th@@ tte or , viewed from the other side , the magnific@@ ence .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the original is marked with the ( 2 ) height for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoo@@ th@@ tte 17 .
the &amp; checking came ; filter coher@@ ent uses color - and Inten@@ sity engra@@ ved to create a carbon copy . the lines which change the outlines in the drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you could have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two regul@@ ator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top controller chooses the pin size and the lower j@@ us@@ hed the contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ tte ) .
this is an example of coher@@ ence filters . the original picture ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved even further through adaptation of the intention .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; filter engra@@ ving forms your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ acked in wax . it uses a copyri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; checking came ; filter gravity is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ary landscape .
the depth allows the contrast to the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this fil@@ tering group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave flas@@ hes 1 , the image is distor@@ ted here in another version of glass bl@@ acks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the kno@@ b .
with this fil@@ tering group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : blur@@ red the picture along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ ous lines that eman@@ ates from a center . this simul@@ ates the im@@ pass@@ fe to see a zo@@ om@@ ous camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : blur@@ red the image by rotation of the pixels to a center . this simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed of a revol@@ ving camera .
remove un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : blur@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to come back in the background .
motion of movement : blur@@ ring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera .
sof@@ tening in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : blur@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or for adding a warm and subtle bulbs .
bulk soli@@ dity : blur@@ red the picture by random shifting of the pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of an arbitrary camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : find the color pool in the picture and wi@@ gs it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through filling with an average pixel .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image . this gives it natural your images a sweet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyri@@ ghted algorithm .
trou@@ gh size it allows to change the size of the tro@@ p . as the dro@@ plet size does not automatically decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of drops in the picture .
you can hold with the &amp; check ; image editing an area free of rain drops . use the range tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should stay free . if you start the filter controller , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the rain drops fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating into the proper orientation . the tools can be found in the trans@@ former turning and transform@@ ers .
photo bl@@ ister is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to smaller is simple . the big question is , how can you get an image bub@@ bles and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here , makes a good work here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transform@@ ative size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for the size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to connect up the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization : uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo over@@ blow was developed by IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are counted below :
the aspect ratio is maintained : if this setting is enabled , when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smoo@@ th@@ ed , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effects it must be set higher than 3 .
buttons are used as and charging are used exactly for it . each inser@@ tion for photo can be stored as a text file , and later be loaded .
photo bl@@ ister is very fast with what it makes , but it can still last very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by adding a small color screen to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear default extension to the comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a commonly underestimated tool to cut a picture . in order to cut a photo , you just need to get a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw up the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle then you &apos;ll see the mouse while you move the mouse .
if you let the mouse sit down again the area of the photos is cut off . thus , you will get a good overview of how your photo would look after the cutting area . you can change the size of the triangle by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by clicking on the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ section , use the button @-@ cutting button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file store or file save in the menu file to store the newly allocated photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the triangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in dialogue remains intact .
in the tool After page ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or insert @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
the tool After page relationship use a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always the same , regardless of whether you use centimeters , instances or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or ver@@ tically .
down in the dialog you can set with the Max . ratio button to the area to cutting on the widest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After page relationship deri@@ ves its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal Direc@@ tional or Ver@@ tic@@ al@@ ) . if you use the random tool displays the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the modified images are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the original image and not the original image .
the settings of composition aid enable help to put your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of similarity . as the third el@@ re@@ ins , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in a similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the di@@ ag@@ onal .
Golden Forest : the Golden Center is a split that refers to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the Bl@@ üt@@ ten@@ ths of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things we experience as beautiful .
the Golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and she was already used in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , who thus used to build your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects built the golden partition in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two progres@@ ses . the de@@ composed divi@@ der is followed as visually harmonious .
the Golden Center provides li@@ que@@ er auxiliary lines when you put an image . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ thirds , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that leads the eye through the image along the spiral of the spiral , creating a symm@@ etrical visual river .
another rule are the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also called Golden rect@@ angle . this rect@@ angle is used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without getting the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also diver@@ ted from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the mid@@ points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equivalent tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ ale to place these lines can cause a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame , create a effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ s dynamic symm@@ etry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve otherwise .
the options horizontal direc@@ tional to reflect and flip vertical can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary line . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens light that you don &apos;t have the camera accurately ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things came around an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ tised . image processing and the tool free rotation . choose Transform@@ ting Free Rot@@ ation and hit the way@@ corner .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the spin is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
for your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation represents a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now please write the angle as described in previous section .
once you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is the function transform@@ ers re@@ cutting from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the auto @-@ cutting function . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing with@@ ered the picture a bit after rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ic transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you must use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the dialogue you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transforming area .
angle on the top above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transforming area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transforming area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transforming area .
after adapting the perspective , the image becomes a little wasted . for an individual adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you &apos;ll get uner@@ ring tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to install this is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from the image processing .
the switching tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and shift the other part into the opposite . this is not a spin , the image is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can launch this module via transform@@ ers .
sc@@ are your image by setting the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can press horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset at zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the finish are shown on the right side of the screen .
your help will be a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to add your image .
after having carried out the she@@ aring , the image becomes a bit blur@@ ring . for a single she@@ aring , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two jack@@ ings generated twice as much blur@@ ring and hence , you should avoid this .
after switching the picture has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are comp@@ uted . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tised .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats , but you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; displays only files in formats that know . this happens using the file expansion and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of the extensions &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you will find more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select even the used format . a detailed description of these formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ arrived ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures for digital pictures . thereby , redund@@ ant information is reduced to this way the image data can be applied to a more efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally there are better , smoo@@ ther results as JP@@ EG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss @-@ free when this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the pipe format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can convert video format pictures in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the Roh@@ on@@ screen shot ; in the configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tised .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; supports the store of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ b which came in &amp; digi@@ tised . with this , more than 200 raw dat@@ ei@@ formats is supported . all cameras can be shown below on the web page from Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of Roh@@ form@@ ulates that by &amp; checking :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips tend to be saved in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format ; but it &apos;s not a film processing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit . if you click on a film @-@ file , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies use to start playing the program to play .

if you can change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initi@@ ale contrast was already very good then you can perform the first four alignment with the module white .
many tools you need the photo editing process in &amp; checking ; contain your description below .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , smoo@@ th@@ esi@@ ze , blur@@ red , and etc ; . use a uniform dialog type , which indicates the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the state of the filter on the current picture . left of him allow five buttons to change the pe@@ tion of the pres@@ cient . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected thumb@@ nail .
horizontal share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area displays the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selection range .
ver@@ tically split . the left area displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide . the top area displays the original and the lower to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nail and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can switch off to show over and under@@ exposure . the colours used can be adjusted in the general settings .
( 3 ) : the frame for the preview of the preview . you can take this frame with the mouse within the image and drop the part of the image from which you &apos;ll want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all inser@@ tions from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar properties displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely sel@@ f@@ elled . it is group@@ ed into the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . this data originates from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider represents an intuitive ticket search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature . you can drag it into a square with the mouse wheel . push C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse kno@@ b to pull a square . all images inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this places your pictures Ge@@ o @-@ data included .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ alle@@ ts files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to choose from colors .
the p@@ alle@@ ts files used by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and un@@ har@@ med colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ alle@@ ts , or search the files according to files .
the cursor is shown in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by chew@@ ed in the area next to a color .
it shows on the color next to it . the color is described under the palm view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to generate such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to move . then move the mouse on left mouse button .
if the cross box is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the shades at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode has been over@@ written . this mode allows you to set by writing the cross box under Bei@@ m C@@ cursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the promotions , crop and Past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a pointer character , in case a further color is followed . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the col@@ der on the left side .
&amp; # graph@@ ite ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; Grap@@ hic . the programs that contains graphs . the programs , the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; contains , are according to the program author &quot; obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; cl@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions .
the &amp; B @-@ user interface ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programmes by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; Graphi@@ cs viewer ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; Grap@@ hic viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; edge ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ ene does reck@@ ons and in &amp; co@@ graph@@ viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; opening or opening the graphs in &amp; co@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
loading of large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to show more than this k@@ not )
further required software : &amp; B graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph@@ ene . required in detail :
the main window displays the graphs graph , each in its own window . at the beginning , if you start &amp; b graphi@@ cally ; without an argument , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( blank ) list random@@ ly opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without extra @-@ buttons , left and right at left &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum lifting of a graphs .
if the file has just changed in &amp; c@@ graphic viewer , the following file has been modified from another program , the following window is displayed :
you can choose whether the graph@@ ite is to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change , so that later will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings for graph@@ viewer ; set ... , see also .
if you open a graph@@ ite list outside an ongoing &amp; c@@ graphic viewer ; i.e. opening ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; c@@ graphic viewer ; that instance , or want to display the lo@@ ad@@ ful graphs in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option you can permanently keep your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at the program launch , you can leave all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph shall be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs are to be matched to one page , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the different parts of the graphs .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without head@@ line and with another font .
the page once again gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program each time .
the page opening gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; co@@ graph@@ viewer ; if an Grap@@ h is opened outside a current session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window or set in a sub@@ window of already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site management system gives the possibility to set the starting @-@ behavior of &amp; c@@ graphic viewer . you can set a default behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if you are asked for it .
the context menu , which is usually at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries , as they are described on the website of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for targeted graph@@ ene . the algorithm puts edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few can@@ als .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for invali@@ d graphs . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spr@@ ink@@ le model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm uses , the equ@@ in@@ significant is with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm created for invali@@ d graphs or layout . it uses the Fru@@ it @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ pur@@ er for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm called the k@@ not circular wall in accordance with the description of six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ eur and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog , where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of the graph@@ .@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms special options , or even the graphs with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or invali@@ dated ) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type on ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for invali@@ d graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview is indicated , if this is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the -@@ mouse @-@ cursor . click with this mouse @-@ cursor to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more help to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the base folder of the source archive .
&amp; co@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tools for presentation . it needs the following program@@ ing packages :
a special set up is not necessary to use &amp; co@@ graph@@ viewer ; in the menu settings you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar tool@@ bar , the .@@ color palette , the .@@ colour palette and the grid @-@ grid in which you draw the symbol .
creates a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you will ask whether you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog , in which you can choose whether the icon is to be created by a template , or whether you want to re @-@ start anew .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images can provide tools available to read new images and to save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
images scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which is supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as video streams . that &apos;s how you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
when you scan the menu effect images you &apos;ll open a dialog that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after this , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace your image according to default . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs , before you read the picture with the button sc@@ anning the picture . the cher@@ ished file size will show you in the right corner , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window is displayed completely , because some settings may not be displayed correctly .
once you have pushed the button sc@@ anning , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to fix the options of the target image . here you can specify the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image stored .
screen photos you can create after you have chosen in the menu of imports &gt; at the scre@@ enshot ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen fot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete desktop button to read a single window under the mouse .
if all own program window will be selected , the call program will disappear , so that you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read , after a short delay , currently reading the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse will be read .
the delay determines how long scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you have to switch to other working space , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time .
after the scre@@ enshot was created , the dialog options of the target image with the options described above .

Flickr is an online photograph on the Internet . with Flickr , it is possible to send his photos to the people who are important . you can show your favourite photos of the world online , show the photos of your camera and@@ ys online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Export from Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided by the process of generation of becoming . it is thus practically used for your authentic@@ ation . so it is virtually your ID @-@ identification to Flickr . a browser is started to log in on Flickr .
after a successful login , the module can send photos to the Flickr website . you will be presented to the following page after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking on Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be displayed in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which indicates the current access legi@@ bility . the module currently does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you would like to proceed with this per@@ missions .
the kno@@ bs up should be pressed once you have all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want . if you press the O@@ k button , the up@@ loading of the photos to the Flickr server .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a se@@ perate list of words . these are added to the image as a tags during the up@@ loading .
with the options openings , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e you can adjust the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as Private accommodation .
when you choose the option of changing the size of the photos in front of the up@@ loading , the photos before the up@@ loading are changed in size . the size is taken from the maximum size indicated at Maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the images . the size is changed , the aspect ratio is constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS @-@ coordinates in the met@@ adata to add and edit . geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ key@@ word of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation makes tools available for pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ at@@ system which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , lati@@ tude and lati@@ tudes are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ p@@ x form . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the top to the visual dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a split file with GP@@ X file . of course this file contains data from the same time at the same places as the images of your camera .
when loaded the file is loaded an automatic correlation which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera will be revers@@ ed with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera eit . lies the devi@@ ation underneath , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have the proper information . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation in a great time difference between camera and GPS is , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ate button .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you &apos;ve made a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog you notice the coordinates from a call to the next one , you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the loc@@ ation can also be found and set on the map . select the relevant region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Le@@ ad this over and over again , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the amount must always be chosen manually . the map can be changed manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite screen and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang onto the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exact tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums from HTML pages conform to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ded to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four tab in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select these albums only . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below is the al@@ ben@@ ign and the text that appears in the head of the HTML page .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely explained . the option for each image is created a page in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the picture is displayed directly with your default screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show is displayed .
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all of your associated images . select a folder on which you have typ@@ ed cursor . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ cons , which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color @-@ depth you can change the standard color @-@ depth . naturally , the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider &apos;s thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for the thumb@@ nails which are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window showing the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the programming issues to determine whether mistakes occurred during the generation . the web browser is automatically launched in the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press Connect to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image field is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image considers it to look at a selection of pictures and perform on them basic operations such as screen@@ ings , zo@@ om or distor@@ tions . it has been developed with short @-@ p@@ unch and mouse clicks . it has been developed for a quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , an image is displayed by default in full @-@ screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss module is a tool to change images without compromising quality .
this module allows to save for the actions listed below , pictures in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses on quality and met@@ adata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of the colour information takes place . this can be found e.g. at P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently not a documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import -@@ function of the met@@ adata module you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image editor you want to copy in the main program , so the image to copy the file image , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after you hit the button OK .
this function does not work for all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported when writing . please check out ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ zer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a basic screen shot . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV from the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally you can create a background color for the slides . using this module it is possible to create formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the pictures to be packed into the MPEG Sli@@ deshow . then you can start using extras to MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the pictures selected by you then are listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change sorting of images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . video format can be chosen from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you schedule the file on a television , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ on or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ adjusted and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed . a low value creates a very sudden , a high contrast very smooth picture @-@ change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave them in black . the name and path of the created file you can specify on the name of the MPEG output file . keep it as possible .
if you specify an audio file using the name of the audio file , it will be integrated into the movie . after all the settings you have adapted to your preferences , you can go with the button Co@@ ding the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your calcul@@ ator you can get drinking coffee or enjoy a coffee while you are back again .
if a critic appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools is missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages on the button Settings right down .
the pressure assistant allows multiple images to print on one piece of paper together in standard photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is for example : useful to enhance you or to print with the Gimp module for direct expression .
this K@@ IP@@ I module can import and convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original feeling of Him is : expect you from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera performers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w pic@@ tured window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re @-@ use the values to optimize the conver@@ gence process . the first option decides whether to use the camera settings for the white . the essential parameters such as Gamma , brightness and Red / Blue ampli@@ fier can be j@@ us@@ hed . if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera operates in the R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the file name remains the same and only the expansion will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses the loss of free LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to use your pictures frequently or otherwise , you should not use the JP@@ EG format as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JP@@ EG as a memory format , the met@@ adata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use it off .
the st@@ acker batch mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . so use this mode , for example , by testing in a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the option to automatically over@@ write file . this is helpful in case these have been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re @-@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can bet the pre@@ fix , the start @-@ up and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . you can reduce the image or enlarge . for this purpose , four types of picture adap@@ tations are made available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the picture is automatically selected , depending on the picture @-@ orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : percent@@ ages in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportionate dimensions in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed by this option .
preparation preparation : preparing the image for photo pressure . the user can adjust the print solution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge @-@ size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the coming pictures beforehand . further pictures can be drawn to the list of images to be used and stored there .
after you have started the module , the pictures window will be shown with the pictures selected from you . you can add more pictures on the button with a file of choice . for the most recently painted image a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and place it to add the list of the images to you .
with the button images , the selected images from the list are removed from the pictures .
once you have selected all the pictures you have OK to open the new message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected will be attached to you as an attachment .
don &apos;t make sure to send a lot of pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and every@@ time again until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a hung file , the comments are put together in a text file put together and the mail swe@@ eps .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best adapted among the loss of free formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JP@@ EG format .
if you select JP@@ EG on file format and are the original files in the JP@@ EG format , then the original video data is added to the actual pictures .
when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed so you can see the status feed@@ backs , looking for faults , can be viewed automatically at the end . with the button Connect , you can switch this window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au appears a window with questions like you want your Sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the OpenGL option in the presentation are activated very elegant image out@@ puts using OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the de@@ asha will be very slow .
the file name option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually t@@ oss them with Es@@ c .
the option pictures selected random@@ ly select that the pictures are shown in a random order . so it is not used to order the pictures in the album .
under delay between the pictures the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds meet 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance largely depends on your computer and your selected transition effect . so you should take it out before you show the presentation to your friends !
there are over a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly , choosing a different effect at every transition between images .
during the Sli@@ deshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you off .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slides .
at the bottom left side of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module back@@ picture is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface .
this module focuses on the currently selected picture , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your KDE &apos;s surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you entered information as you browse your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look to EX@@ IF based information , watch the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described for itself .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method you can restrict the number of images of a few thousand pictures on a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your impact .
in the picture every person has the same icon before their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but for each person his own thumb@@ nails , this is of course also true for places , keywords and other categories that you yourself defined . see the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button which you want to use right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category . this has the advantage that you can see for example symbols with images of individuals and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must set yourself what image is to be displayed for each individual person . in order to view this , you will have to view the picture editor &apos;s window ( in near@@ er window ) , and select the image menu according to your needs . in the An@@ si@@ chts window you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your needs and select which part of the image is to be displayed and cut off .
if you call for an entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the solid image characteristics . this dialog lets you look at the picture once more .
if you enter a string into the lab@@ eling or description , the sign@@ ments and descriptions of the pictures are searched for after this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options at the bottom of the window , you can browse all the pictures for certain name as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however , not Anne Hel@@ ene is depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . . if you do not like to read manuals , but prefer to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the fast @-@ entry , the screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; Le@@ x album ; and choose the demo in the first dialog , in case you start &amp; co@@ ke album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry of the games album ; -@@ demo . then , some examples will be loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this hand@@ book , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of the main window , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name already says , this bar displays you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline displays you several different time units . each box shows then a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database , showing the box only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline allows you to interact in the following ways : you can preview the indicated entries preview from the database ( when you select a date , the first picture of this date is displayed in the preview video ) and also the tim@@ eline shows always the current date of the currently displayed pictures , when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select one area of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ eline will move . if you select one area , you will see in the preview view only images of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; # 3 album ; will provide you with two options at your disposal HTML website with your images . one is integrated in &amp; B &apos;s album . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; 3 games album ; integrated version described you can create via the HTML menu ...
before HTML @-@ pages you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the moment and a description which is to contain the HTML file later . on cardboard album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; # 3 album package ; -@@ export file should be created on the review page . nutritional information about the export files can be found in .
last , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed by the viewer also without description . remember that all pictures are exported from a party . you can currently use this setting in order to hide specific pictures from certain views .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , why not in this specific way .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download the maximum resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your side can change the resolution at any time . so , it can easily change your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he does not want to display a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored .
you can best select a base folder for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent set you will find a new sub@@ folder .
first you will have to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and set in the next time . thus , you can select either a folder or a record by KDE , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if they &apos;re really all visible for viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you will not have to copy it manually . so that the import function , behold , correctly you must specify the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are .
the currently described settings are related to all three of the base folders and URLs . in this case , a sub@@ folder is laid out , whose name you can define in output folders .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ eg@@ s album ; come together , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you already have a lot of time for it , the image information , persons on the pictures , recep@@ tions , etc .. enter , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , this work does not even make .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the image characteristics are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a short@@ cut to images . the advantage of all images can have taken up and that file can be accessed as independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the pictures in two fold . first the corresponding pictures are not found , so the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ Export .
the following is described in the dialog for ex@@ porting images , which you can export via the File menu .
the main option of this dialogue is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , the following three choices are available :
when you switch direc@@ ting to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Autom@@ atic option , copy the .@@ k@@ im file to copy &amp; # 3 , the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most pictures have been compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not required to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this anyway , just choose the option export file compressed .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum picture size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very big . here you can say the size by saying that each image is 800 pixels high and wide .
if you choose a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File imports ... select , will import &amp; # 3 album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wiz@@ ard to the impor@@ ter consists of four steps . first you have to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you are the category individuals to the imported file person@@ er ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) , while this category is in your database persons . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories are to be imported to the imported file and which categories will match them in your database .
the fourth step allows you to switch the categories to the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is displayed on the picture .
it must be simple to browse and look at pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to look inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see for example images of your Italy &apos;s holiday and discover a picture with your boyfriend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this manual you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) fixing the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the look and look , through to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ t@@ possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for the administrator of your pictures . it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book , talk about images , but frequently it also closes videos with one .
&amp; # 3 album ; saves all his information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . it is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; # 3 album ; remember the folder in which your images are saved and used it for future start @-@ up . if you want to read a different folder with pictures , you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; co@@ ke album ; with the option -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
about the menu entry settings in the menu item , set up ... you will get to a window by which you can change the settings of &amp; # 3 . in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to the different settings options .
to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can visit the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call through a key@@ press on the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
it has been described as you can define each image different features , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals , or albums .
you can see the dialog that is used to already existing groups . for each available group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in dialogue options you can set full members groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at one time in one group instead of explaining all groups of a membership .
to see the settings options available to you . with the listing selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . nutritional information can be found on the home page of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be viewed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this hand@@ book as they are not part of &amp; # 3 . but most modules have an aid page , which you can call via the modules itself .
since the modules are shared with each other with each other , it may be that the modules tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo @-@ database before you call them via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ eg@@ os album &gt; or through the menu Help . tell not , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ eg@@ s album . do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between the games album , and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are using their images in albums : this type of order does not support , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order to albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simul@@ ates &amp; co@@ ke album , the current album , that is simply the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture previ@@ ew@@ er at the moment .
next to the current album has to be released &amp; co@@ ke album ; the modules also handed over a list of albums . here &amp; # 3 album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ los album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album of the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in the setting dialog as a category for virtual albums , for example , if you &apos;re using the category people , so do &amp; # 3 album ; so do if you have chosen individuals and share this to the module .
as some modules with &amp; k@@ eg@@ os album ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog , and choose the module modules which modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a boot screen as soon as you start &amp; co@@ ke album ; start your own pictures .
as you are used by any other KDE application , take a look at the top one menu and a tool@@ bar . in the tool@@ bar you will not find much information about your pictures . in the section we will be able to see this window , now click on this window to show you an overview with all available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , is the ability to see each picture with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , etc . you can put any image either individually or for a larger number of pictures given specific notes simultaneously . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see this notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you will see three lists with a text box by choosing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as you can use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the shifting of images within the list : for example , if you have a family party and are shown on all 50 images of the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , therefore , that the used names are moved upwards to find people more quickly and assign .
if you prefer to show an alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sorting after date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and provided these pictures with notes . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multi@@ ere entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . moreover , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you see a browser window which indicates the US as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Com@@ ments Di@@ versity , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally you can also draw an entry to a category and drop there to make this one sub@@ category of this item . attention , this implies that you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this .
you can postp@@ one the different elements of the Committee of Com@@ ments by clicking on the box , which form the wa@@ ist of the frame , and move it . you can make your own window out of a frame by taking it out of the window .
if you have customized the look of the window to your needs that you are happy with the settings , click on the button options ... that offers you the possibility to store the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame fully . if you want to see this window again later , use the button options ... and then window a / hide . this will see you in the picture .
when you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ images of currently selected images , or all images in case you do not have a filter . for example , you can view the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure it just times .
if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
when you click on one image , this is displayed in the image field . if you have not opened a window with an image viewing , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture previ@@ ew@@ er . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete , and select either the Del@@ ete key or select in the menu Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; # 3 album ; for this problem you can use a solution . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , namely pictures too , without saving on the hard disk . of course , you need to record the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; # 3 . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ los album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that the thumb@@ nails will be displayed . however , you can preview these images with the image viewing .
as you see , this function requires that you would like to copy files from the folders and then copy it . so , if you do not want to avoid browsing the specific CD , please buy a larger hard disk in order to save all images to it .
in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with your name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you want to unlock the pictures so that at the end those left you want to see for others and click on Cur@@ rent View privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that may see your little sister , con@@ ta@@ xed and select the menu item all out of current view .
this way , you set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to block the laptop with your little sister , you simply select the menu @-@ entry pictures , eliminating all the pictures you have blocked . if you want to see the pictures again , click on Sper@@ re .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be typ@@ ed to unlock the pictures . to set up this password , simply change password in the menu privacy .
remember that this image protection is by no means very secure . for a one you can access all the images on the hard disk and on the other anyone who can instantly read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are working with &amp; co@@ ke album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private pictures .
the reason you can spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ x album ; manage and spend hours on hours of course you want to describe it . for this reason you have to look at some point . for this reason you have a picture _ and Video@@ viewing album . you can preview this from the preview , as described in .
the viewer is able to see you in . it shows of course the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and disc@@ ard it elsewhere . you can also configure the information and whether information is displayed on the viewer . all these options are available after a right @-@ click menu .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here , the browser , see the matching entries on this page . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were missing persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; # 3 album , then introduces a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus or minus . it will be stopped by the C@@ tr@@ l by buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is able to change in the full @-@ screen mode . in this mode , the spect@@ ator uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input key to change in the full screen mode and back .
if you can use the spect@@ ator you can get into the picture and finish zo@@ oming . to Her@@ ein@@ zo@@ om you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can reverse r@@ all@@ ine The Plus key zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the simultane@@ ity , sets the zo@@ oms so that each pixel corresponds to the screen to a pixels of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work at videos function that they are in and out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and your main key .
with the screen@@ shots from the context menu , you can shoot the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you &apos;ll have a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . in the moment you can view the view and insert configurations of the image in order to print this name . however , you will perhaps prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you look at one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer provides the opportunity to look at pictures with features while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature that you press the corresponding letter . in view you see a picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have inherited features on your images , they are available to you in the browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can just use all of them with notes . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in D@@ re preview , then you can add features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the feature after the image was selected .
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will be allowed to paint &amp; # 3 , on the picture .
the mixture is not stored with the image but in the database . in the way you can re@@ vert your painted back later .
in order to view a picture on the painted menu . to switch the painting mode of &amp; # 3 , select the picture from the context menu . to finish the M@@ alen , simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you need to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not completely control , but the documentation for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the properties tab and the object is shown in the wire modular views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously , but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu .
there are multiple possible positions , the following folding menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can then remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have modified features , click to apply to apply these changes . if you typ@@ ed the values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and then click on the changes with abor@@ ting .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already includes the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ ts view .
press preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ ts view and a small example of the scene is lo@@ oted by the chosen texture , even if you wish to have a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cris@@ p you locally .
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level . you can indicate this value relative to the Visi@@ bility level of the superior object or as an absolute value . objects are only then displayed when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar chosen level of visibility .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window of window as default . the object tree and the view of the properties tab are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need another order , you can adjust them as you like . you can also save several window frames and simply switch between different orders .
to anchor a window above or under a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is anchored on the right or left side of that view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to assign multiple views to each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the cart@@ on top in the views .
the last possible window of window are floating views : views which are not anchored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the anus to the desktop or click on the small to the left of the arrow in the anus .
to conclude a view , click on the small cross in the anus . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any type of view . new views are slo@@ ping , you can anchor them in any place .
the current window view can save you with view window order ... save it . it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual is written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support .
to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon rendering of the icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or click in the View &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ender modes ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following dialog is opened : &quot; &quot; &quot;
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name any name , but it is a name that allows the characteristics of the mode .
in the cart@@ el card size you can enter the width and height of the stream image . if you want to ren@@ ame only one small area of the picture , select the section section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields .
in the combination field quality you can choose the characteristics that uses &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user Refle@@ ctions . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ;
if an image is loaded with only one ray each pixel , there can be different mistakes . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è patterns or mol@@ t effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details will not appear if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally you see pictures with this property better .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; recur@@ sively because every pixel is constantly divided up and adap@@ tive because each pixel depends on the calculated color range .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray records a ray each pixel . if the difference between col@@ ouring to the nearby pixels , then both pixels will be calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the lowering of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling , a lat@@ tice of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , at a low level of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue from the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue from the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ determined threshold , then the pixels will be shared in 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be pursued individually and checked on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the repository value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generating of smoking for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changing &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ derer is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light re@@ flexi@@ on calculated . it takes very long to allow a scene with this property .
this card card allows you to adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent if the associated rays are not made object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; capac@@ itors . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray scene , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : not the complete command @-@ catching of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if when import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; write this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can export objects from the object tree in the editor to export the code text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object in the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ame . usually this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the Fe@@ atur@@ ts view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation . make the path to your documentation and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; looking for external files ( for example gra@@ ins ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you involve files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to list the path to these files here . if a file appears in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the triangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type labels .
you can set the object @-@ cat@@ ches of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ menu view . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ ali@@ zations and screen@@ ings .
larger values display a more accurate wire model , and therefore a better fitting for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detail @-@ level for two directions .
if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced proj@@ ections , all the wir@@ ing model is used further , if the camera is using an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you cross wall , a wall behind the objects is loos@@ ened . the wall is represented in a shaft pattern of two single @-@ adjustable colors .
when you cross ground , a ground below the objects is loos@@ ened . the floor is shown in a shaft pattern of two single @-@ adjustable colors .
if you want to activate the canton of English , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for rendering of scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information on the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can modify existing window frames or create new window orders . in the window panel , it is explained how to create and store window frames .
the standard window window : displays all existing window frames . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window frames shows all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the button Add and delete a selected order with the button .
any window of window is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can be added with the button Add and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with which , anchor your window under the existing window , with cardboard card , you will receive a card @-@ card view along with the previous view and fro@@ sted entr@@ ust the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and now you want to start with more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate however simple scene , among beginners like very popular : a bul@@ let at a level .
but you should note the following warnings , before you complain that you as a result only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set any camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert a light of light , your whole scene is in the dark , and you only receive a black picture .
if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ less , you will see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the following assigned window :
take a little time to get to know the menus and available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice it in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view properties tab , in which the various parameters of the camera do . in the user &apos;s documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find more details .
not change the basic settings of the camera , this is later subject to instructions , but note that the camera is in view control points , with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera . simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you apply the button or press the input button , the wire model opinions and the object tree will immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could for example insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting end body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ulative method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : actually provides an easier way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the button , or clicking the input button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view shows now also the plane , even if at the moment only as a limited end level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane moves up to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + before the object . in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the properties tab .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise an unit under the horizon line , just allow you to get acquainted with some of these parameters . select shift and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust his material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment .
in both cases a dialogue will open in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the property object . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree ( name = soil @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments shows only a mat@@ ured black material because you can &apos;t need to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , always remember to preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . you now give the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities , but take the simplest .
if you see no color on qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now correct . if you ren@@ ame your image now with a click on the icon you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color . you need to enter two new attributes , called mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me . then edit this entry twice ( you can also edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board colour list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the properties tab :
this step should you already be able to perform , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . the ball is just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the properties tab you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button to press ) , so that the ball has ho@@ vering over the ground , since you have moved the ground to move a unit down .
of course , the rendering now yields a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a mat@@ ured black material . set the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign yourself a material now . as already in the ground , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as colour :
select bottom property and change the name for example in the ball pig@@ ment . click on the ball pig@@ ment , select then mon@@ och@@ re and set the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on them or press the input button .
the settings she@@ en effect and reflection already result in partially good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even if metal@@ lic yet is not selected at all :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . hopefully you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tracing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts a scene , the ren@@ derer is hypo@@ the@@ tical b@@ lasting from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that crosses the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene and how the visual effects of light springs in the scene and how to affect atmospheric effects such as fog . thus , the scene pixels for pixels is dealt with .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , any scene that is to be inserted , some light sources and at least one camera .
in usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file expansion * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and space .
sets the scene again in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage have been rejected .
this menu entry you can only select if you have not yet stored changes in the scene .
repeated the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry you can only select if you have used editing them .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for hiring &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the short@@ cut short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands by this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands or add new ones .
opens and remove a dialog to set up the tool@@ box . you can add and remove tool@@ ing for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to surface rou@@ gh@@ y surfaces without need@@ ing to model every b@@ ump on the surface and without changing the geom@@ etrical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a b@@ ump map and for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geom@@ etric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , by applying a picture file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewing and browser . the application has a file browser where you can choose images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full @-@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return button .
you can adjust if each picture is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images are to be used in the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file in the bottom window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if an appropriate date is found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing by return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , you can set the short@@ cut for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the images are opened in full @-@ screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not a full @-@ screen mode .
if this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still have the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; at the end the name of the last opened folder . at the next start it opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the coloured beam to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full @-@ screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can show &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so that only some of the types of file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option for large images the display window will be enlarged on the full screen . this option is switched as default .
notes if the slideshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time period of change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is broken down from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
here the short@@ cut @-@ short@@ cut for the different modes of works of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the box card short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option you switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
shows great symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short@@ list .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short@@ list .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short@@ list .
res@@ ized the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
the image is enlarged by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is open .
show the picture in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ commission ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ tised ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a quick image editing with some powerful bas@@ ing tools . you can use it to watch your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to his part to a minimum problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . this displays a listing of reports or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser opens a page to reports of problems and wishes . all necessary information is already filled out and you can simply follow the instructions to release your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you submit a frequent user list from &amp; show@@ photo ; however , we would like to answer you questions from other users here . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer &apos;s mailing list . guidance to join the developers mailing list from &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flow as possible . there are many options dedicated to the behavior of the show@@ room . to select on these settings , you must log in eight pages . you can switch between these changes by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
in the field of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ folder or over@@ exposure indication should be selected . lay@@ outs should display the colours with what you are supposed to show in contrast . expos@@ ing should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ room window ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . the same page bar you can also find in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan of images that does not make more than images to scan and save .
&amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that does not make more than images to scan and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save for each image a dialog to store or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images from the store .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a default scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog is opened to select the scanner .
the user can select the scanner scanner and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
in order to add an image , the user can only start a pre@@ di@@ can and then scan the scan for the final scan . the preview is started by the preview button .
in order to select the picture the user can get into the picture and out of the current selection also zo@@ oming . it can also indicate the z@@ oom that the complete preview window will fit into the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you save a preview of the settings in the settings , then the picture is displayed in a showcase , as shown below is displayed . if saving is pressed , then the image is saved and sho@@ lie ? en leads to a quar@@ ry and you get back to the main window .
through the button settings the hom@@ onymous dialogue will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can look at the picture if desired , before saving . in this case , the option is selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; pictures store . dialog to store for each image opens the dialogue in front of each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sc@@ ant@@ l@@ ite ; these automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save it without having to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images can be saved in the option without saving a file name . if the images are stored for each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for dialogue for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture @-@ fix for the automatically set pictures and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for storing . this automatically stored picture gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for storing . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button help starts the KDE @-@ help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button Over starts the KDE -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these p@@ ump@@ kin and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be created by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Glob@@ ale short@@ cuts . -@@ specific short@@ cut you can set by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window and select short commands ... select .
you may possibly set existing multimedia buttons so they can work as &amp; Amar@@ ok . thus , make your keyboard on &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly also available in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ COP functions from collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP feature could pause &amp; eg ; look like this :
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the commands @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de . in addition , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed due to missing dependence . please check whether all the required modules are available and use a dialog , so the user ID , why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE Bind@@ ings for Ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.@@ is required for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply expand the required features . you will soon realize that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the aid of D@@ COP can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the simplest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be included in any KDE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands . this means that the function can usually be called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sends aler@@ ts to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should be monitored regularly and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore events when there is no use for it .
configure We@@ is the script to display the furniture dialog . to save the store and loading of the setup data each script must take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ante sets the work folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; eg ; with D@@ COP to more information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the denom@@ ination ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ary Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu cli@@ ppers that can be clicked to identify the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom @-@ defined menu item can be identified . to remove an entry again one can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ o@@ . the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. storage of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks Script @-@ Administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be optional with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which allows the user to clearly see the archive as Amar@@ o@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Advanced . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to lad@@ le modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right :
if your script package is finished , you can load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you are also looking for a very particular title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting Browser and the Quick Search will you find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists Browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard to select , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria .
Amar@@ o@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so you can listen to your music . Amar@@ o@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and fancy - just the right to re @-@ experience your music !
usually you have to input in the base folder of the Amar@@ o@@ springs , to compile Amar@@ o@@ ok and install :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used , you should not have any difficulties in compile them . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , like most applications , has some options that can enable or disable the comp@@ iling time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the comp@@ ili@@ er@@ options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements .

to keep up the piece of piece on the piece of piece , that the playlist window opened up / rolls to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
switching to the context @-@ browser displays automatically the context @-@ browser when the next piece is played .
in the section of appearance , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section you can use the use of different writings in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . by selecting their own writings , the otherwise gray @-@ described section is enabled . you can select writings for the following field : playlist windows , player windows and context @-@ browsers . press to select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the tor@@ ment of choice and can set up a separate color scheme . use the activated colour selection for front and background color .
play in the start , that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; after the program start , play automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it stopped in the last end .

the box card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers activate even more settings in this card card .
the card card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for collection .
here you can select the folder , which is to browse for music files . to include a folder in the collection , next to its name . this section also contains ti@@ cking areas to setting , as with the selected folders .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ o@@ ok takes only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs therefore installed ( including the programs included in it , for example , modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will operate the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ cop@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as they are set up an excellent development environment .
most likely , one of your files will make a mistake in the tag@@ li@@ b library . you can view the file by clicking on ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Pay@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log file . please report these errors to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang out the cap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and let the collection again create .
mostly it is that Tag@@ lib cr@@ ashes when reading the Met@@ a @-@ info file from this file . please report these errors to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , check SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of these libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if Z. B. &amp; Amar@@ o@@ fold ; with GCC 3.4 , tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to overthrow the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate automatic . turn off if in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash , the error is guaranteed .
this is due to write many program data as an UT@@ F @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ info , but it does not mark as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;s
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynam@@ ical playlist ) will be active in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the tool@@ bar effects are simply forgotten . you can click the status de@@ activated on Gray and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases , you can click on a icon for up to three times , until this attitude shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ solved symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ o@@ ys is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
in order to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf , that Amar@@ o@@ ok takes the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems arise most ligh@@ test by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ o@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake if something is located in Amar@@ o@@ ok .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; appears only a blank playlist . how do music pieces come from there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start window was converted into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under extras .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the review by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces in the playlist , the application list needs to be indicated in the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to set the review for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select a playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall , just like you would do it with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the add button , the button playlist is stored . click on it .
probably you lack the program x@@ m@@ ms config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new . look for li@@ b@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is available in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . also , you will find it via the menu bar under &apos; E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ah ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm . as you see , we support this pretty much every conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be delivered in the pres@@ et any MP3 @-@ Dec@@ or ( for patent @-@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must be able to use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously can be obtained through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software Mix@@ ers ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different sh@@ ink ( eg os@@ s@@ cars ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media is first de@@ codi@@ fied . G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ bug or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codi@@ fied it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly on al@@ sa , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time minority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set :
at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of Sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your Al@@ sa setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help you well .
either do not use the Arts drivers , but instead of the Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ multimedia entirely to obtain the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ s.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the buffer , the less s@@ lugg@@ ish the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , I cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ab . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you have to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all of the stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask the IR@@ C Canal # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ o@@ ok before ! ) : - Download it m@@ peg , compile and install it . then you will then run G@@ ST register , once a system administrator and once run as your normal user . then you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
please tell you of bu@@ g@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ o@@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . also , the name contains the magic C ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP is that already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and let you perform with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running before going to bed , then you will be a@@ wo@@ ken by the gentle pots of the music that you stopped right before bed .
how can you find the current one in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the current title will be experienced when you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows : this command gives you interpre@@ ting and title of the running piece : ssh - I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ using Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ player
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and your username . this requires that your identification is available in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . press the window on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size of changing windows .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the click of the queue in queue . through pressing the input button , after a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ ingly functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the Control Panel ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ o@@ ok , the collection database may not be created and on the console appear many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to the normal read , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired finish folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic co@@ ding , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Q@@ C@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; W@@ HER@@ E &apos; ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ string ) ) ;
basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has every single evaluation on the total result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking on a sp@@ readsheet in the playlist window . then mark how all the other attributes also , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : evaluation or F@@ 2 press . you can edit the rating also in the dialog met@@ adata .
the developers do not want to show you whenever you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ ok . this means : KDE Pack@@ ages have a fixed publishing plan that does not come together with the short notice plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok that some users can easily find annoying . de@@ activate the option symbol when playing anim@@ ate in the Universal Settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select settings tool@@ bar and make the desired changes .
download a design , or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ o@@ ad ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click on New Design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to avoid difficulty it was removed .
con@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok while you are brow@@ sed in the con@@ quer@@ or . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation section . then click on the button Settings ( the top ) and select in the folding menu Add Amar@@ o@@ ok .
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ ck@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information that pieces can be played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and a password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ ck@@ bler is entirely supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use Al@@ sa , please use the newest version . old al@@ sa versions have a lot of stor@@ my and thus also a lot of error reports .
probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine do not compile them . you have to re @-@ configure &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution that is installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed separately from the actual program . however , the same applies for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards , you will need to re @-@ compile and install again .
I consider the mistake of stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. how can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer at no P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : uses no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you are comp@@ iling Amar@@ o@@ .
I consider the error is is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to be able to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with a stre@@ amer , it has to be installed beside g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time .
you will get the error there is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream off , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer in@@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system management register . then you start Amar@@ o@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use al@@ sa . how can I use Amar@@ o@@ ok the second sound card ?
under settings Amar@@ ok setup ... audio edition give the device a . typical is for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on one machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ NT@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug Sh@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ inch &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } Calcul@@ ation l.@@ js 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ ose @-@ audio { type 1 }
enter the setup dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b audio and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sc@@ anning , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual @-@ mix device , turn off the skins with sound card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio edition with Arts is not taken care of . you may want to take this problem yourself in your hand ! if you like , you can use the new so much needed tut@@ oring for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the Setup wiz@@ ard that will appear at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . if you want to update your collection , or the assistant simply don &apos;t like , then this quick start @-@ guide will be help . with her help you will have &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; in a few minutes .

group@@ ing interpreter - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is shown directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are left apart .
group@@ ing interpreter / Album - First , the pieces will be sorted by interpre@@ ts , and among them will see a further distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see connections or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing interpreter / year - Album - Sor@@ ted by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the standard 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically sorted each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces will be sorted sorted by genre and among them by interpre@@ ts .
group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but will also be sorted according to the album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing entirely to expos@@ ing and combine .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . please note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection automatically when you have something to change to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this could take a while .
directly under the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the man@@ ic view alike . notes about using this movie can be found in the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection field , with whose help you can filter most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different tim@@ esp@@ as from the last 24 hours to a year . of course , you can of course also select your overall collection , whereby the filter is practically disabled .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities .
load - This returns the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play .
in playlist , hanging the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
configure pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue for a long time . thus , you will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - saves the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name where the list is to be saved .
transferring media player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . further details can be found in the section on the media player &apos;s browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / burn to CD - Dad@@ rough the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as a file or an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not display .
met@@ adata ( for n piece ) edit ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece @-@ information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) files in the du@@ st@@ bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , promp@@ ting it to be different interpre@@ ters .
compilation @-@ up @-@ up - changes a compilation album back into a normal album . the album will then no longer appear under different interpre@@ ters but again under the affiliated interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser establishes the handling of a lot of play@@ lists . among other things he also includes an intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart playlist . this use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart playlist consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even self @-@ created play@@ lists are possible . click into intelligence playlist to open the dialog to create a new intelligence playlist . there you can enter all necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; for example , it must be installed before the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod included . if &amp; Amar@@ ok , you will find the pieces on your iPod according to Interpre@@ t in the top @-@ list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces on your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them drop on the list . thus , the pieces will be up@@ loaded onto your iPod . if the transfer is complete , stop &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; and solve the disk transfer for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you find a search field , with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders using very many files , because in the file list all files will be hidden , which do not comply with your search criteria .
in the bottom part of the file browser is a addres@@ see , with which you can get music from a drawn URL . if you press for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ gz and press input button , you can get to music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop it down .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the link@@ age of files can be difficult to be difficult . in this case the susp@@ ens@@ ory of the Shift key can be helpful : this will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouth position .
the playlist contains all of you to play @-@ hung pieces . you can change the order by typ@@ ing the entries with the mouse to the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed . to reset the filter , press so long the back @-@ down , until the text@@ box is empty again .
if you enter by whit@@ esp@@ ace separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for entries , all search terms include , if you enter for example one two three , the search will find all entries , one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms , search for entries , which contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found which contains one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , then include the search term with da@@ isi@@ tion . Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries found by Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : evaluation : &gt; 50@@ th This is looking for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a given phrase , create a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is searching for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ taxes according to them . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment .
you can set the pick@@ up sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . then the entries receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be rec@@ eded .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you find the button Add , by which you can add to the playlist . to the right next , you can save playlist , playlist blank and random folders .
next follow the buttons and Rest@@ ore . thus , you can re@@ vert or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar you will find a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can get in the player window above the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up Amar@@ o@@ K &apos;s configuration .
there are many other available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for instance ren@@ dition controls and loud@@ speakers . you can set up the buttons , clicking on the menu and create tool@@ bar .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play@@ time of all pieces . in addition , the status for falling mode and play@@ time of the current piece is shown . the status for random mode and re @-@ fetch is easy to change by clicking with the mouse double in the appropriate ad area .
you can also hide the status bar . to disable them , you can view the status bar status in the general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window , or by clicking on the playlist menu . via this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with short@@ cuts to this document and other information to &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
the Cover Administration is a useful tool to manage your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting promotions in the collection browser .
the Cover Administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by choosing the performer on the left side .
with the menu view you can choose which is to be shown in the cover administration . select from :
the queue administration received your big train in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you will have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in queue , this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is first played , 2 as a second , and so on .
manage the queue for long lines . if you want to add a piece to queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then change in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details to set up this follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further coinci@@ dental pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ ck@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load @-@ meter profile to work this dynamic playlist .
click double to the desired playlist , drag them into the playlist window or click the playlist window and then select loading . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist so under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ featured modes of random mix and play@@ lists will fill up your playlist and you can start the play@@ back directly . the playlist chec@@ kl@@ ed pieces starts with a blank playlist and you must add at least a piece of yourself from your collection . therefore , your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . over the same menu item , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the button New fill the current playlist and adds up new pieces according to the dynamic mode . playlist process opens up the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist you have the option to click on Edit . subsequently , the dialog to edit the settings of the playlist .
insert any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for coming pieces will be over and they will be no more double in this playlist . if the setting is active , the pieces will already be removed from taking care of gest@@ ed pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . thereby you can easily see which pieces have recently been played .
this is the number of pieces added to each playlist to be added to each playlist . if you set here more than 1 , the playlist is continuously growing , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog you can select from existing playlist or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ys ; random pieces from each of the inter@@ sect play@@ lists will add .
some scripts make their own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , install on the script , by clicking on the script . after you install the script , a new entry will be installed in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button Find out more scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . just select the script to install it .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please take a look at the writing of scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins becomes the activation of available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the cross box next to the name .

e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically reproduce all videos on the CD &apos;s base .
this is a convenient way to load again recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
stores the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s dialog is saved , with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all the open projects . this is the same when you would call for every single project file store .
closing the current project . if a project is altered and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then switch between save and change . besides , you can also leave the closing down and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will inqu@@ ire for any non @-@ saved project , which is to happen as if you had called for each project file Connect .
closes all performed projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ saved project will be asked what to happen to happen , as if you called the file .
when you call this entry , you can select the output dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you click the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialogue &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above . what is that ? -@@ Help described ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you import files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful when sharing files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous meeting will always be included , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can already see existing files and folders using the media .
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature lets us remove files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium , it blind@@ ed only the previously imported files back .
opens the CD @-@ Copy dialog . this also allows the copying of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also create an image from a CD which you then can then burn sometime later . you should also prefer to copy clothes if you like to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this also allows the copying of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use only one image from a DVD which will then be burning later . furthermore , the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data from source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to the format@@ ting of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to over@@ write the choice between the typ@@ mod@@ i and incre@@ mentally .
burns a previously created CD @-@ image . the dialog ask you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which are then immediately supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD @-@ image . the dialog ask you for a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previous DVD @-@ video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the index , but can also be used all @-@ standing . it contains information about the full video , code settings and even possibilities to changing the size and cutting black edges .
shows information about the occasional medium . this information is shown in the index view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of the tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar currently is visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
unlock the folder view , or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the index has been activated , their content is displayed in the index view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , locking and unlock the tre@@ et@@ ting or throwing the medium .
unlock the index view , or out . the index allows you to choose and drag files into the proj@@ ecting view . the index is also selected the interface to read audi@@ o- or video CDs , as long as a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
unlock the coupling in the project view , or out . the p@@ iste is a nar@@ ro@@ wer that is only visible when the project view has no real function , it looks just pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this will open a dialog window to modify the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , it is possible to adjust the key@@ note order below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs can be adjusted , so you must enter the password for system Administr@@ ators ( root ) at the start of the assistant .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programming documents can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb ; this dialog is meant for person@@ alize and to the fine @-@ judicial system of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so it is rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial that the accompanying programs you give .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP . to use these functions , you must first make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have in common all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ COP interface between &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for generating new projects are available .
D@@ COP@@ f Cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ sle@@ e@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void format D@@ v@@ d ( ) void of D@@ v@@ d ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( k@@ ur@@ ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( k@@ ur@@ ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ COP reference to the newly generated project : D@@ COP@@ f ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project will be obtained via # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch at this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) void of void ( Q@@ string path ) void of void ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new name ) void set@@ vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
with this , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folder and then adds files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bug / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT Printing Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; a read for &amp; k@@ de . . with it you can easily save audio CD ; s out and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the Encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the surface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in W@@ AV files on the hard drive ) and by many codes ( loss of free compression ) standard ( compressed free compression ) by default ( This code binary packages will still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD is read ; read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the los@@ s@@ free F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . nearly every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step you must be installed ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ ed ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers . all these programs are usually not necessary to compile any self @-@ distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something of yourself . however , only the code packages are not used , the installation does not need to be used , the installation is also not required .
which code / file format is to be used ? the chapters Space Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ zer , audio quality and compression .
a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copying protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device fails to deal not the mechanisms of cop@@ iers . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only one needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration ) , following the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understanding the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
you can get &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the internet or may work completely without a network , whereby all is captured manually .
this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step , you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s tab for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case it must first be connected to the Internet connection . )
start reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the Co@@ di@@ ode settings in the setup folder - the enco@@ ding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Encoder so that selecting a different idea can be read as the default . it is to note that previously the Encoder has been configured in the Co@@ di@@ ligence settings in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already loaded file to code is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog for the type of aler@@ ts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ts ) for programming events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main introduc@@ tory dialog of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different cart@@ on cards ( like en@@ coder , to address the en@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co @-@ comp@@ ilers and compression rates and helps you to choose the right code .
if no audio information is supposed to be lost , a loss of free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and barely available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats , the information from data compressed to their psycho@@ acoustic model are MP3 and O@@ GG the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important as both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still delivered with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or machine based music system and / or when one of the few existing O@@ GG tools is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car @-@ stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Medium &quot; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . well enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and Auto@@ stere@@ os@@ ks . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the free@@ DB program , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be transmitted / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with co@@ operations , there is often a combination of programs for the code and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ workers explain the switches for these programs .
for example , adding the &amp; CD ; titles to key@@ word ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are coded using l@@ ame , the switches must be added from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the assistant ) :
that is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CDs instead of entering into the machine . it is to note that here is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces and etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( starting point ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; any more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be done . all information can be preserved from a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is actively playing a cross box . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( fake ) address than that in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of free@@ DB , the geographical server is needed . this saves bandwidth network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of reflection on &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which elite programme is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; save in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that there are cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more accurately , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed first if this has not yet happened .
for storing the busy W@@ AV files , the code and therefore the desired file format are selected . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss of free compres@@ sing for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ zer package needs to be installed from the particular Linux distribution before the code can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined code . further information on Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapters of Space Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a code you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ en@@ window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . it must be replaced by the name of the code installed .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the equipment &apos;s name &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reader real it and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , all understood , are but still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step by step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas which make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , and read all our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3@@ s with an V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be listed as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , whatever you can do of course .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have scre@@ ams to it ( eg , trying to copy something into it with the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which presumably is done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read &amp; CD ;
here we determine the use of code for the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are lazy , we share the program with the free@@ DB program to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings anytime , we will most likely not be reading a &amp; CD at any time , if once the appropriate settings are found .
the Device @-@ drawing is handed over to the read @-@ program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real Device drawing of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive available , you can also get a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the equipment for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card holder of General settings . here you do not need much to do . here , an additional conversion will be defined . in our example everything will be printed as inserted in the scre@@ enshot as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
only with incomplete information can be selected , so that you will be informed when information on the testimony of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card holder CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded over the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the machine must be during the reading of the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet so he can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry be found immediately when you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the file name / file names or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory name or file name will be modified with Con@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; day .
aside from this example is further to note : if you do not want to manually enter the listing areas and free@@ DB is not used . you can use free@@ DB locally in offset mode , so the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following box card .
CD@@ DB is for us of free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put it all the way it is shown in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a reflection server in your vicinity . on this road , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as first try .
both work equ@@ itable as to the server , since many fire@@ walls dri@@ lled the protocol 8@@ 80 standard , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to submit a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first iter@@ ation point should be clear .
just take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously read pieces : ap@@ ology , there is a reason why more than one at the same time only an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , you tick this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you want this to cross it , then the file / folder can be stored in which the W@@ AV files will be stored . if the box doesn &apos;t be crossed , the files will be stored in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to make something with the W@@ AV files .
all as inserted as it is on the screen shot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances must be fed something to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi@@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average approximately 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously on enco@@ ding W@@ AV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to codi@@ fy more than one W@@ AV file .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic establishment of &amp; audi@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as default for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section described how the process of reading the &amp; CD is described . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is set on the hard disk , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described , must be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in free@@ DB , see the screen photos a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of taking them from the Internet . comments will point out the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done , now the &amp; CD must now be defined in the drive , which has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window should be listed in the window as in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read .
if this does not happen then you look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the settings .
note : if the &amp; CD was completed successfully by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are shown .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key to your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which you think best suits your &amp; CD .
if you do not select the cross box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but you need the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 : 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entry of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be inspired in the input field &apos; current title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ versions for each piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB the CD editor is not empty , but it has always been a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor , so that you may not only begin with the artist and album name ( e. g. if all words with large letters are beginning or not ... ) but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the comment@@ aries , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment@@ aries . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have un@@ restricted field length , at least to what &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum . this option is set up on the tab holder &apos;s settings ; take a look at the section &quot; base settings . &quot;
you can change the tag information about the generated files at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the Help for the Ko@@ di@@ ers to find more information .
simply select an entry , which is evident with the style of the read CD ; matches . in this example , this is not important as we do not submit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example can be found under skir@@ t .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece , definitely and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB database . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the list list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or beg@@ ged the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button selection of the read process , so this window appears to be confirmed . OK , then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read straight to the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a code of code that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully coded using a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered in the example . have you checked whether you have writing to the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the bug occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
the mission 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and code parallel . notice the status message in the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration settings to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes is unclear . the calcul@@ ator used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with current accounts and code ( of but two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded , and a third order is coded in the queue of the code . after the last piece is coded , a small window will appear with a message for a short while in the upper left part of the window appears .
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x and 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; will chat today inside the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package . however , you can download an anonymous copy . most of the distri@@ butions have already included a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is addressed to individuals who compile source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs if it once runs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variants of settings . the best read the step by step to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different cardboard cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that may not be used in the example .
hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu was clicked , after the first start of the program , without any clue as it should go on , from this somehow empty screen ( especially when there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is all about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; may it do . at least just after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has bel@@ ated this section and therefore agree with this proposal .
strange if you succeeded in taking the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ oke gam@@ ers of &amp; k@@ de . . besides others he has with real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ style adjustment of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , thus , should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; k@@ de ; supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for CIS cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a Sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of any MIDI @-@ channel activity by high@@ lighting the buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de , any MIDI file from one &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window to cap .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . K@@ Mid will automatically identify the procedure used in each case .
seat support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the play@@ back of a song , K@@ Mid starts again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI @-@ Syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter , you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also let a file from one &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window to drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and beg@@ g@@ gle the button folding in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out of the menu or beg@@ ged the space button .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( on several pieces they will be added to a collection and then re@@ played each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a play takes place , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the regul@@ ator .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tem@@ po@@ graphy and so change the play@@ back speed . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ on LCD .
the whit@@ esp@@ ace has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the blank is like a pressure on the kno@@ b , or selecting the menu or pause in the menu item , thus inter@@ rup@@ ting the play@@ back , while no piece is played , starts &amp; co@@ mid ; playing .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be presented and even better : the her@@ ign@@ ant type is automatically determined to set a song so you don &apos;t need to manually set the kar@@ a@@ oke text . you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a her@@ al@@ ign@@ ant type , select from the menu settings the items text events and lyrics . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you combine . these are played in line . in this section is how you can use collections efficiently .
to insert a collection , first open the collectors manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired in the collectors manager .
to the temporary collection all songs that you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . worry about when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting managers . there , you can add a song using the button Add Fol@@ der . it appears in turn the file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic execution is enabled to collect , a piece is automatically added to the opening ( using file opening or D@@ rag &amp; Drop ) automatically to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and ert . this collection will then be added to the continued pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open up the collectors manager to select the collection and the desired song and then click on Del@@ ete .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select The row after the sub@@ menu paragraph of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you can add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in collecting manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song further , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right .
to reverse a song back , select the previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the Collec@@ tor manager , select the collection and click the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer who are not general @-@ MIDI . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events translated into events that syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the type change patch to B@@ right Piano in the type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type change , and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need any MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl. A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favourite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all necessary settings for the play of a piece .
every section may appear only once , except KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section that may appear as often as desired . prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
they see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a paragraph is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section is specified like the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard . general usage is as follows :
please note , that the left side of the Equ@@ al sign is ignored . it is thought that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments we@@ ars .
the optional all key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard , for example , do not take a gun ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which gives you the following into the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun signal ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drums on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here , with the term Tum@@ el patch the patch is meant , at which every sound represents a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ment ( drum , basin , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone is the ton@@ al of the ever same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how tones on a particular channel or instrument are shown .
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you must create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you just need to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used mainly to make notes on the per@@ k@@ lim@@ mer channel . check out the included key@@ maps for example .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and the second channel , you can easily do it in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion to a particular channel ( general MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n &apos;@@ n it is the channel which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will obviously continue to be defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored that try to change the patch on this canal . in this case , the patch gets used later .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k@@ eling patch on the per@@ k@@ lim@@ b channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch benchmark events will be multip@@ lied with the value n , this is calculated with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file no dec@@ imal number are available ) .
this setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard that gets a pitch using the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole row cla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI canal ) . on these pi@@ cks you can see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the se@@ al@@ view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , the button no longer green but red to show that no longer the original instrument is used .
the can@@ al@@ view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played notes . you can select the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ der ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; having done this because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support , you have to download a source : download and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree that supports &amp; k@@ mid ; D@@ rag &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ Wind@@ ow .
before necessarily activate the setting of automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can switch the arrow @-@ button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD @-@ LCD to slow the back . to restore the default temp@@ o , click on the LCD double .
I have been on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ work surface a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I have to play a mi@@ a@@ oke file ) or added . in this way , I have to play a mi@@ a@@ oke file or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window change and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you just want to listen to a file just quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn the setting of automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ D . first , you just want to play the first file . so make the adjustment of automatic addition to the collection and opening A.@@ D. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then decide to play at B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me , continues to program .

if you would like to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you simply want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ pad @ ar@@ ra@@ pad @ ar@@ ra@@ ho@@ .@@ es
you truly make a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all those who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact you by friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send a MIDI file , however , you should contact me because I might have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and by anyone there is money . I therefore want to emphasize that I can only keep on programming , because I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends largely on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an A@@ we card .
if you do not have sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VI@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not listen to music .
if you encounter problems , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error right to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to download video files that supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on formats , as well as to play@@ back of DVD s , V@@ CD &apos;s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; has not yet been completed than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional assistance please check the page The KDE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . either , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connection below the book@@ marking menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are to be played according to each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ical view . if you have a entry , his group and all his sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and play@@ back begins with the clicked record .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML configur@@ ing files . of course , you can only do when &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not running through the application itself . simply click on a name of a category C@@ click on it from the View menu and as next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you need to be selected from the menu of the same with playlist , and either the processing mode selected , or another category will be selected .
all changes are lost when the processing mode will leave or another group will be selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during star@@ tup and ending can be de@@ activated by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; share the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ sp@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at Star@@ ts does not need to be short , it will automatically end by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end of the animation , so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying an favourite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ iles ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ iles ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ iles ; in the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that will be supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ players in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size of the dat@@ ac@@ ro@@ ms from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player clearly visible .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configur@@ ation dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ ability . here is an example like a &quot; flash &quot; with the sw@@ apping / sw@@ oop mo@@ z@@ illa .
&quot; Flash &quot; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be added to the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can reproduce in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ type M / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file classi@@ fications of KDE are given .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is to search in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no mistakes here , the back@@ end issue inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) is to be examined .
with that a blue@@ print for a certain M@@ IM@@ E type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done through manual changes in the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . for example , phon@@ o is to reproduce all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this will need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked at , the scanner device can be used and the TV channels can be used manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data Rec@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog is used in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . there should be ports to be found out of which one is selected . the correct co@@ ding must be found ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it .
since the V@@ DR can benefit from k@@ m@@ player only X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of play@@ back from video devices to Linux ) . this is also necessary only on the first screen ( : 0.@@ 0 ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ linux will need to be functional for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 servers , this is required to contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , source source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ ann@@ ers , source source source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled them , they begin using the play@@ lists of the playlist .
are there any indications like I can make my CD@@ ROM drive away when I play off from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is designed as user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is imperative to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom shows on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does every time my CPU need to be tested on their performance ?
note : the answer is exaggerated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine is testing the CPU .

l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , is likely to be accessed via the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; respectively , ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , documentation of distribution or installation CD should be included .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are available on the ki@@ le ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must hardly read this manual at ease . however , all proposals for documentation must be taken into account . if the support for this project or the documentation must be made , the contact via the ki@@ le ; the website should be made .

the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is an industrial feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; . selecting the assistants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document .
document@@ aries : this is how the type of this document will be noted : article ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; read@@ book &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; read@@ book &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom .

new users now don &apos;t worry about . it is just a short description of the functions and additional information is given in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; it offers - as well as other source text editors - the emergence of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the appropriate ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; it is likely to have noticed that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it will save you by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you by the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment time and again .
with automatic read@@ ings of the environments is created by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ , { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically generated a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the corresponding line to the end of the command ( eg . \ \ reading { command } ) . this function can be ki@@ cked in the menu item . set La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; l@@ atex the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the most common element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse click on the respective .
when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; once a DV@@ I ; D e V ice I n@@ ów File ) &#93; created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; spect@@ ator to the corresponding line in &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source code .
a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the format document , and also other information such as font and is besides PDF the above output type of &amp; tex ; or l@@ atex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and upri@@ ghts .
when using the item description , the elements of the DV@@ I ; file ch@@ opped with the editor and once upon an item in the DV@@ I ; -@@ file has been embro@@ i@@ dered , becomes the exact opposite of it . once upon a paragraph in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code has been chew@@ ed , becomes the corresponding position in the DV@@ I ; spect@@ ator .
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide Master document can be adjusted to project settings .
quick conversion : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code ) .
file watch@@ ful : in this mode the DV@@ I ; file on the basis of n@@ der@@ s@@ ungen@@ â , this is no call for &amp; ey@@ ep@@ le ; after the fast @-@ building .
when considering the edit tool@@ bar , the three types of selection fields are stri@@ pped . the selection fields have been designed for quick inser@@ tion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The prescribed &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection field further is for example of articles such as tags , fu@@ sions , notes , or references .
name : with this command a name for a section is created , an image or other element is created .
cover : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection from a selection field ) .
when selecting a quote , a selection list with literary events is displayed . for example the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b . . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ ff@@ e is used for setting the font , for the main text , the fox , notes etc. are defined . the following fon@@ ts are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices for preparation : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason in hand .
the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ ins class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also occur in the text too .
once the above source code has been typ@@ ed in the &amp; l@@ atex ; code text will be compiled . the simplest way to this is the use of the building or the button fast .
the source code must be stored in front of the compile . &amp; ki@@ le ; for storage is automatically saved .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be sought in the logging according to errors . if used by speed@@ physique &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ . this is not the case , should also be considered the logging .
an environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font . the \ \ \ &apos; { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end { environment } is deemed to allow the type of writing in the surrounding area .
the changes are merely within the vicinity ( from \ \ &apos; { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no description ( number ) for the change within an environment .
there are many possibilities for treating the read@@ ability and usability of the document . it can include certain fon@@ ts , fat printing , cur@@ ative pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . , these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a phrase can be presented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Price : creates a quotation in the document . the quote begins with \ \ &apos; { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; l@@ atex ; recording address , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ;
once an assistant has been typ@@ ed a little text , a few adjustments should be accomplished for the better read@@ ability of the document . they should be mind@@ ful . a quote , a few places in the fat and curiosity and a poem to the application come to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , can be returned to the editor via Editor &apos;s view or C@@ tr@@ l ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DV@@ I file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply test and fun .
DV@@ I ; is a dedicated file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ants ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi Edition like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF transform@@ ers or computer imaging .
for the printing of a &amp; DV@@ I ; file is the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I , the document can be printed by file print ( in the viewer ) ( provided that the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DV@@ I ; file to other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source code was created , the conversion will begin to begin using the button in the tool@@ bar .
looking for a direct leap from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offering a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . for this , only Modern under settings may furn@@ ish Ki@@ le ... tools build up .
to carry out the pros , the mouse must be positioned in a line of source tex@@ tes and fell asleep to pres@@ ump@@ tions . the go to the corresponding position in the DV@@ I ; viewers will then take place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document called the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; document of &amp; ki@@ le ; available and ki@@ cked ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; as text editor will set ( settings ey@@ ep@@ le set up ... Editor )
if an error message of the &amp; DV@@ I ; spect@@ ator does not exist , an error can occur . should an error exist , this is indicated in the log file or in the message window in summary .
the log file expl@@ ain@@ ted the fault of error in the source code . in the editor you can always see the line errors in which the error seems to be . to consider the faul@@ ty line , the error must be chew@@ ed in the log file and &amp; ki@@ le ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
once the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar is clicked , a window appears to choose from the template for the document .
in selecting a document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard for the quick creation of a new document . further information can be included in the section .
sophisticated users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates are available in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file format or a new file will be created . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting a document template .
when creating a new document from a template using file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings Ki@@ le ... settings should be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering a document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ &quot; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps was accomplished :
when creating a new document , you can create your own template instead of default .
a template can be made from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files created . is a simple way for creating a template , should be searched for an Internet and the steps described below are carried out .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the beauty of reading and her@@ on of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . lots of settings for bed &amp; Kate ; can be made in the menu tools directly from &amp; ki@@ le ;
to learn more from Kate ; and his mother &apos;s abilities should be attracted the manual to Kate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can there directly with reading the chapter works with the Editor of &amp; Kate ; begin .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ command reference , which can be inv@@ oked by the help of La@@ Te@@ X reference . it features a available description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with added Str@@ g button to hide the &amp; tex ; -@@ word to hide . that means that in this way by clicking \ \ by \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ by \ \ par .
in the dra@@ gging of the text with penetr@@ ated lin@@ ker mouse button , the text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons with penetr@@ ated Shift key , you can find parts of the source texts in the editing pane .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the ability to browse all kinds of source texts and to highlight them . for example , the l@@ atex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants have a lot of book@@ marks available . in this case , it is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu marks the jump to the next or final spr@@ ing@@ on . this is also highlighted this spr@@ ing@@ mark , so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a pointer .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent possibilities for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; source tex@@ tes are added in &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands included . &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands given to their selection . under editing terms , the following commands are included in the text selection :
do a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph , this extended meaning are not included in the text , l@@ atex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of source texts . the only preventive thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is with it that the expiry date separated by two blank lines .
note the word under the current Cur@@ sor@@ position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also l@@ atex ; -@@ commands with a round star ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end .
to the part of a part of the document can of course be removed and removed by taking the button Ent@@ f . &amp; Kate ; provides the key@@ note r@@ zel C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides with its own commands , for a faster result . under mach@@ inations are the following commands to contain the text :
removed a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description to mach@@ ining paragraph .
it has already been noted that environments will play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; for this reason , &amp; ki@@ le ; for NF @-@ other instructions in mach@@ ining for a simple work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
this command is j@@ umped into the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the desired setting .
with this command to end up the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to end the surrounding area .
if the cursor is before or within the commands \ \ &apos; { environment } is located to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many frau@@ dul@@ ent ambient commands , quickly the desired view can be lost . this command is all@@ ot@@ ted the most recently paved area , so that the t@@ ach@@ i@@ dered environmental structure is not destroyed .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for l@@ atex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from mach@@ ining environment .
with this command is j@@ umped into the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the desired cl@@ amp .
with this command to end up the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the sli@@ pping cl@@ amp .
if the cursor is before or behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is located to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many frau@@ dul@@ ent groups @-@ brack@@ ets can be lost quickly the Ã ¶ ff@@ ening group . this command all slept in the last group , so the disappeared structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; l@@ atex ; are used two simple an@@ aer@@ ation characters . for the purpose of purpose is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple an@@ available characters is used . also for example , the sign &quot; used . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two slept on the other for l@@ atex ; one .
this automatic in@@ line of double the double belt mark can set up under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X and will be activated .
you can also use types of specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and therefore German or fran@@ si@@ can mark . there are also many other languages available .
during the wir@@ ing of Shift ; entrance @-@ button , &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent pointer is placed . if the current position within a lists of environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is available &amp; ki@@ le ; not only a pointer , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a tables surrounding area surrounding &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a grace@@ ful row break down .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to pre @-@ set &amp; l@@ atex ; - or custom environments to support . these can be added under settings : set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users m@@ asked the columns in tables environments and thereby all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; tries to educate this . while this t@@ ulator is not the nearby Tab@@ ulator , for example &amp; ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ator .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source text system offers , this was added in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for example &amp; l@@ atex ; ) yet . it can be installed for NF @-@ different modes . all these modes can be set for different working methods under settings ki@@ cks ...
at the beginning a new environment by using the command \ \ begin { Sur@@ round@@ ing } becomes &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the \ \ \ end { environment } following an empty line ( for the text ) .
the last character of the entry is removed , the last letter is removed and allows the complete list of results . on the other hand , the list can also shr@@ ink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , descriptions are removed from &amp; ki@@ le ; also spr@@ ing@@ ders has been frozen , so that a simple jump to these positions can be viewed via Edi@@ tors &apos; next spr@@ ing@@ ray and can be viewed .
under settings ti@@ le ; furn@@ ish ... ki@@ le ; wir@@ ing settings can be made to these lists . it can be possible different wine list for &amp; tex ; - und &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands as well as windows of general language use .
the command mode is for the actu@@ ation of environments not wet . it has always used a few letters with \ \ &apos; and the call of completion . on the other hand , the environments are often used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for re@@ alising the environments .
when calling the actu@@ ator mode , or the button @-@ button Alt + Shift key , the command to the environment of the environment is automatically checked and it appears \ \ &apos; { . afterwards , ambient temperature can be carried out in the easiest way and can be terminated by the input button .
after this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognize that it is a list environment , it is even used to include a first \ \ item command .
under settings ti@@ le ; set ... ki@@ le ; wir@@ ing settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the usual list of actu@@ ator mode for tex ; - and l@@ atex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supported user @-@ defined lists of ab@@ out@@ ings , which are immediately set up by longer strings ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions can be set up . as an example of a purchase list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L entered and the word full @-@ filled mode , the screen coating , or the key@@ chain of C@@ tr@@ l + Alt blank cables , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X character .
large str@@ aps are not helpful for automatic read@@ ings . however , a lot has been written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; ki@@ le ; the execution for all is already written .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can be set up in the men@@ ue Settings ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ fully &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; here , the Corpor@@ a value can also be determined for the display of the ful@@ lest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / / / / / / / / / / / private home folder . mode is available for example ( Ab@@ str@@ apping ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ om@@ log@@ book ) or tex .
the dialog graphics design is designed to create graphics as simple as possible . in order to view the foundations of graphics formats , the sections and attention should be considered .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer excellent basis for modifications and re @-@ orders of pages . will the PDF output can be displayed , so you can re@@ generate the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then be converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to examine the outcome of the work , the source code has to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the quantity to create comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewer , such as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the further transformation may be the key@@ chain ; 3 ; 3 , the DV@@ I ; file is converted to a PS file and be seen through Old ; 5 the PS file can be seen .
when using the instruction installation , there is usually inv@@ oked a spect@@ ator after the comp@@ iling . should not be used in an existing viewer , each time a new window will be displayed .

often working on a project for several individuals in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; supports the information team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties tab .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nickname and serves for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , like both team@@ leader and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can look for himself from the list of members of the team members who is looking for . this happens by pressing the team member from the list and presses the button . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears fold according to which you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be an event created for information to the team leaders when something specific is happening . see for additional information .
event actions are actions made when something particular is happening in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closure of the project so that later , how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file will be saved , or a script that adds a file to the CV@@ S once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can be created , edited and deleted .
an E@@ Mail is sent to the addres@@ see list selected in the recipients list . the addres@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such a ladder can be set up .
note are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
to include notes is simple . it may be chosen either the note item from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by the text text .
notes may be sent to an identifiable member of the Team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nickname of the first nickname of the team leaders should be stated in the following examples and sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .

large / small ins@@ cription of attributes : large / small ins@@ cription of automatically converted attributes . normal Groß / Dist@@ ingu@@ tion means the attributes are inserted as inserted in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if added , for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after it ; added .
not optional tags automatically include : as above all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start - and end @-@ day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic set of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during inhal@@ ation .
M@@ IM@@ E types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ s for detection of different types of files . using the standard default , the default values can be restored .
standard character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding created by newly created or in a different way acts as a file opening open files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be passed ) . however , this setting will be rot@@ ated by the same in the proj@@ ections if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting will be rot@@ ated from the same in the proj@@ ections if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; creates regularly backup copies , so with an electric power or crash , in the next start of the program the document of this backup can be restored . this is not the same as saving the file . even if not saved documents is a backup regularly , according to the time set up .
the preview and documentation can be displayed in the editing area or an own view ( or the documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time .
setup the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface has come by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on view@@ points . it matches the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command @-@ line parameters .
the warnings area is used to control the taxes of the possibility to inqu@@ ire the ad of warnings carried out by no longer .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can be specified to display symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ isation behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . as regards the various modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree can be set in detail the picture of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document .
in the field of mouse @-@ click on the struc@@ tur@@ f causes the following action , it is possible to change the action solved by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structural @-@ tree settings , the visibility of the tree can be opened on mach@@ ining and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , where no element has been found in the current document .
the range to set short@@ cuts ( a kind of templates ) that can be un@@ folded in editing process . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can provide a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ uses abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are all part @-@ applications used by the third party , which can be re@@ used by each K@@ part @-@ capable application , the best @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . with inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins you need to be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in , if it is not in a stand@@ still like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is delivered to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuse the shop . only @-@ L@@ ese K@@ parts usually refuse the store , if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iro ; , if the given information is correct . select the storing even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from version 3.3 , the bug has been completely re@@ developed . th@@ ief for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the d@@ b@@ g debu@@ gger . instead , a Debug@@ ger @-@ Plugin was implemented , the various implement@@ ations made through plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ iring Saul ; inser@@ ts .
using the debu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the Debug@@ ger @-@ Plugin pres@@ feld the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iro ; interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . appears usually in the left dock .
a view in which all the holding points , with pointer numbers and conditions are listed . usually occurs at the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually occurs in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the link to debu@@ gger , in case required , or it divi@@ ding the plug @-@ in with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ gement . this action is triggered by default , when a project is opened , that does not need to be respected in the normal manner .
the counter to debu@@ gging session Star@@ te the meeting . closing the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds to meet requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to direct a debit request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the debu@@ gger edition .
points the debu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and information on the surveillance variables as well as the currently exec@@ uting line . when this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . happens before a debit request started , the script starts with the request .
points the debu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information on surveillance variables and the current pointer number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution runs further . happens before a debit request was given , the execution starts when a request is placed .
the debu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , without responding to the functions or includes .
the debu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes faul@@ ty error .
points the debu@@ gger to move the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the over@@ seen value appears in the variation view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable are set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keit@@ h Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works by Keit@@ h .
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ham ; adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ete ; help to get better .
document@@ ty@@ p Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are available in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages . their simplicity and flexibility makes you perform &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ru ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script and / or CSS . tag folder contain two different types , the tag folder and tool@@ ing files ( above the editing pane window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever appear .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the contents of the property dialogue , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool make a fast inser@@ ting of tags in a document without risk of typ@@ ing .
tag folder are nothing but a folder . you only contain the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the authentic@@ ation language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in an easier way .
this is the root element of a day XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain only the item type above itself .
the type of the tag is a script feature . when using it , att@@ r &gt; an argument to the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a Commons Attri@@ but@@ t and the attributes within this tag may be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the text ; text &gt; tag . that &apos;s a only element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only happen once for each attribute . it puts the name and the type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
gives the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag of Edi@@ tors and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ru ; will be used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting @-@ interface and a methodology . the arguments , which are passed to the method . can be empty or % per name % , that means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ day group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can happen for an attribute description only once . it is an only element type element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tag within a dialogue . this day can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each one &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; Day ) .
gives the position and the size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
indicates a list of elements that may occur within the appropriate tags . this element is a only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything but pay attention &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; shall be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialogue at the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eth ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialogue will appear , its simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check only takes place when loading the tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul .
in the following an example of a family 1 day file . this file describes that &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; diagram . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function described . the file name of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ pa@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings . thus editing a &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a new &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D / / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
an action can set up with attitudes actions ... click New Action leads to the same dialogue :
&quot; &quot; &quot; this action is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weight short@@ cut &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; by clicking on the user button user can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ one the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick start -@@ dialog , or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first the name of the scrip@@ ting and interpreter must be specified . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting variable in the command line , like sh % scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods , there can be a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the default application , you can determine what is to be sent to the default application . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input can also be re@@ directed to the output of the conducted application . there are two kinds of issue : normal edition , directed to the default output . error messages , which shall be done with the text written output , by default the value of the listing edition is set :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group , so it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ ups .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings promotions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action Kno@@ pf@@ es at the bottom of the window starts the edit mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes has attributes and you plan their use , activate a dialogue &quot; day editing &quot; if available , so that a input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use the &amp; K@@ Menu , graphics and other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose To@@ x@@ 22 pixels .
please note that the created symbol is not only helping you remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a button @-@ button as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user is sign@@ alized , that An@@ ck this symbol is one &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; -@@ day in the current document will insert .
after the creation of the symbol , it must be associated with the action . this will be done via the menu with settings promotions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; ) and selecting the desired action . beside the text box is one button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the apply button and continue with other tags , so there are still , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ete ; -@@ features to the tool@@ bar or it should set them a better overview of some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar to adjust the tool@@ bar to make settings for settings . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , push the arrow @-@ button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to preview or add a quick way to access the quer@@ or . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . anyone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button is .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by proo@@ fing all the symbols to make sure everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable enlargement of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter , how I create a &amp; PHP ; document @-@ tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ru ; -@@ Re@@ pository whether someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first part we leave you , the second we treat you here .
# KDE Con@@ figuration files &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index = = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ html &gt; 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html &gt; 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html &gt; 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html &gt; 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so much :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction = Cre@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Re@@ ference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ synchron@@ ic@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess tel@@ eph@@ ones ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the top of the Bau@@ man@@ cy &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but watch on &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources c@@ end@@ at@@ eien .
the content @-@ section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is to be displayed for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . through marking the function name and pressing by C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ acts ) and the fil@@ tering lines .
a simple list of using twin @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply and after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as stated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are well and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation were used on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ru ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the ex@@ cre@@ mation of the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ ing with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anyone else . at different locations there is an e @-@ mail order menu , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , using email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ologies ; -@@ users can download it . the contributions are checked and only available when our team needs them as accurate and useless for publication . to make a more beneficial contribution , we recommend using the resources to be signed , why there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . this means that the source of resources is ensured , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their personal GP@@ G keys for their private GP@@ G keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys you can choose to . in dialogue with new resource the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can be empty ) and by clicking on the up@@ loading of OK the up@@ loading .
the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still prior to installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and signature . in the case of problems warns it and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warnings and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the statement of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ie@@ . it can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files can be necessary on average XML format . there is the easier way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion from the D@@ T@@ D menu and converting a D@@ T@@ D can be started . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description that is to be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target directories : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition : the string that is written in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day , such as HTML Public / / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .@@ d@@ t@@ d
tuning the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eth ; after the conversion the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; there are a few key concepts . to understand these and get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , so you have to start with these fundamental concepts . this chapter is trying to bring them precisely these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ prehen@@ sive .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ology ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ology ;
global elements are available for everyone , who &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eth . use , available . from tool@@ ing on actions it is all that is marked as globally in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ru ; this enables the group of administrators different tool to secure actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ making . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool with special actions specifically for the files of a certain project . simply said this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree , making the common use of special tools and patterns from all the staff within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editing window , the building views , the cart@@ on@@ ers with information and the tool@@ bar . please suggest you in and for further information on these areas .
you can click the card @-@ leader with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current documents , such as close the current , other or all card cam@@ ents , re@@ charging , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editing area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , how basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste / paste ) , edit the word under the mouse @-@ cursor , or open the file , when the string is called under the mouse @-@ cursor a file .
at the top end of the editing pane , the tool@@ bar takes place . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ kit will be shown . in the course of further construction of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ box will be adapted to the new functions and associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bar is really light . if they want to insert in their document , then click on the icon that represents the day . now , they can insert the data for this straight &quot; tag . if you want to insert the data for this straight tag ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the components ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ru ; to navigate , to open and wander . in the presentation with Kart@@ us@@ hes , you stand for files , project , model templates , document structure , scripts , and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ie@@ . this view displays all the files in the project and allows the car@@ et@@ ops of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or delete the files from the storage media can then be performed with the context menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category is always available , local templates are available only for the corresponding user and assists in projects are available only in the project . more information is found in templates .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the right mouse button , you can access the available information on a script via right mouse button , such as the script to start , edit or send email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through left @-@ clicking on the element , the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . through the right click of an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears under the other structural views . with it can change some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . this allows the modification of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . it can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ore ; &apos; document site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project may be added to project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eth ; two cards are rated at the bottom of the window , which can be reached via beneficial information : the news window and the problem window .
this card @-@ player shows information about each in Qu@@ anta ongoing script . so , for example , the D@@ T@@ D used in the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D are displayed .
this card @-@ player shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; scripts that are executed , give any error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ kit can be expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the Cho@@ ad@@ es@@ e@@ ite of the tool@@ bar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar by e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ archive over &amp; mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can provide them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ete ; how any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ete ; modify files on your system . for this , auto @-@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help one . the options are simple to understand and not executed .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eth , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 I folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web @-@ development tool optimized for the KDE @-@ surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; has been optimized for a quick web development and combines a mat@@ ured development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ editor began to create the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a separate , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor would be ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now on the way to a general and comprehensive Web @-@ development tool . together , you should define it in &amp; XML ; then you should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to be the suitable &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eth ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer &apos;s community is based . thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Sc@@ st is not only that possible anything but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to extend the way they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can enhance the productivity almost every task . through the program comp@@ ose , they can have &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; extend without having to remember a scrip@@ ting language tax . ( more information they find in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast design development and quickly became a mat@@ ured editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers settled the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details and documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either do this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta perform ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ lu@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list is changing every time you open a file that is not on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and entire files as templates for later use . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ diction , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts with inser@@ ting the cli@@ p@@ board contained there special characters to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ prescription , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting assignment .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ prescription , which is the correct way to insert special characters and space in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used to insert &amp; URL to the anchor day .
unlock the block selection , or out . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages out !
is searching for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions , to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window where you can see the display of scripts and debu@@ gger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; education and switching of the problem @-@ re@@ porters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eth . the main problem of the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structural tree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
displays the tool@@ sp@@ old left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the urs@@ ors in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard@@ disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; projects will be stored with the file .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files are then copied to the project directory .
searched the project directory according to new files that could be there . this allows to copy , e.g. graphics files into your project folders or sub@@ folders and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded another entry / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
attitudes , how &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in project You / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be defined by means of settings ... can be stored on tool @-@ making tool store or you will be asked when you want to store the tool .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of sight . it does not delete them from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you would like to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ team so that the tool@@ bar will be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of machine tools to the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
invite one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iro ; own description format .
load / refresh the En@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be refres@@ hed from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , without renew the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is and a St@@ ation@@ f in the global KDE folder is not available , the loading fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day @-@ setting dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags always , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ts means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed among the above @-@ mentioned menu points . click on it . click the activated @-@ plug@@ ins disabled .
el@@ ects the syn@@ tax@@ onom@@ ous mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ seals depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .

checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; using the external application of tidy .
instant change between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the KDE libraries , the con@@ stit@@ uting sometimes need time or uncomfortable graphics . recommended is the cart@@ els mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ru ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . with a selection of a single @-@ window , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
displays the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eth ; main code on or off .
the changes in this dialog influences each application , which use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser .
judge the behavior of the editing pane . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; find details .
a dialog appears when you delete entries from the tool@@ box , or which you can add and change the sequences .
this should produce a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; development in financial form , they find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out at the top from top to bottom , as for example after filling the project name the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author @-@ information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties are set .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file is automatically filled .
that is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without space , with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address , to which one wants to access , one , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ unprecedented ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this allows to add files from the local file system to the project . multiple files or whole folder can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web@@ content you want to download and change . with ser@@ vers@@ ed script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files are required somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started anew , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
this option will display all the files and folders inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good vou@@ chers .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by clicking , or , by removing the tick , cling from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings which simplify your work . these settings can be loaded in the menu with project properties in the sub@@ window profiles in the sub@@ window profiles , or with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( Plac@@ eholder is possible ) that will be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as the project folders .
supple@@ mentary option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proj@@ ections , which is being loaded when opening the project . in addition , more about project views can be read . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables the desired debu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information on Gub@@ ed can be found in . the debu@@ gger @-@ Plugin can be adjusted with the button options . in case the debu@@ gger is described .
upload profiles can be set in the sub@@ window profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile , by dra@@ fting a separate construction view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration you can switch event actions and add these actions , change or delete . event actions will be executed when a specific event occurs , such as the sc@@ anning of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul open ; the last project that was open . this behavior cannot be influenced .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as expansion .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eth ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will ask if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eth . changed files occurs . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project man@@ oeu@@ vre provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files in the current project can be managed .
folders are likewise missing , however the entries are missing and open with ... within the right mouse @-@ click context menu :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the top @-@ to @-@ read files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is available , the button is canc@@ eled , to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forget about program@@ ing . this possibility is useful when frequent up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather un@@ secured password saved on the record -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; many high @-@ profile profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) are up@@ loaded to various servers . with editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified Dom@@ a@@ inn@@ ame or an IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . usually this does not have to be changed except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming can easily see in the plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool . there can be a lot of views in one project , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool can be loaded and replace the current files and tool@@ box .
views can be saved in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ham ; at its own way of working .
as mentioned above are tool @-@ made in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best to make use of the tool tool@@ bar . use and add @-@ to . the addition of tool@@ bar will be handled in the addition of tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be set in either using Con@@ text menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new tool@@ bar can be set out , can design@@ ate other actions like tool@@ bar , which can be specified in dialogue , where actions on this or other tool can be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition the entries will remove action and processed the action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up the menu with settings tool@@ set ... and set settings promotions .. set .
templates are essentially document@@ aries , code cut@@ lets and files for link@@ ages . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates , basically like a nasty file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link each of the existing directory in the pre@@ fabri@@ cation tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; in about the limitations you imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , provided Templ@@ ates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each presentation .
bin@@ ar is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually included in documents using link@@ ups ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre@@ fabri@@ cation tree under global templates . further information on the Tem@@ plate tree is available .
documents can be compiled by any text document . based on these templates , new documents can be compiled in appropriate sub@@ folders . normally , specific sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ es are prepared for the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in appropriate manner to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pre@@ fabri@@ cation tree under global templates . see in for more information on the templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is supposed to be inserted on a template , but the same text area again and again into documents . some examples are found in the pre@@ fabri@@ cation tree on Javascript or Perl . some examples are found in the pre@@ fabri@@ cation tree under global templates . see in for more information on the templates tree .
as the name says , serve these templates for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a zi@@ pped tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ham .
design a documentation structure according to Beli@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose file as a template save as a local template ....
once this is done , you notice that ( although it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the pre@@ fabri@@ cation tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on file as a template save as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging on the belly @-@ view templates .
the production of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy into one template folder . it can be used all file management functions , such as pulling and deriv@@ ative or inser@@ ting via the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a name in the file tree or in the project files building view to a folder on the right and secure site template , which will be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates provide a very target @-@ oriented pre @-@ oriented procedure . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or link dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link with them . additionally you can keep some things when using templates in projects very profound in mind .
the pre @-@ structure structure in the sub@@ window template is based on the files presented in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder is in the pre@@ fabri@@ cation overview with the right mouse button to click on the folder and to select in the context menu features . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is canc@@ eled as soon as El@@ ter@@ ly attributes im@@ pe@@ ed ha@@ iled .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regul@@ ators inside the pre@@ disposition . if a root folder would be set , unless they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ tree , if nothing appears , one is probably in a root folder .
allows provided or recorded text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project and allows to equi@@ p the head@@ lines into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers for a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
in addition , you have a right @-@ click menu ( to show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; - Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the editing window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch if needed to the source code , in which the changes performed in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , continues to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to alter this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes both in the source code Editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will be activated , this mode is already active , the key@@ press puts the active cursor from a window to the other , where the position of the document is maintained .
the synchron@@ isation unit between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is adjustable in settings Qu@@ anta . in addition , you can select between synchron@@ isation to a click or automatically . in addition , the selection will be adjusted in addition to the time period . basically the recommendation is : a small span@@ ish for fast machines and a big span@@ ish for slow speed .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the document properties . thus , the editing of invisible tags in the work with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor will be created . this allows the reduction of the suspension code . thus , one can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information on the document themselves e.g. to keywords for Internet search engines . Met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click into the list enables modification of the content , e.g. keywords on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to bind an external CSS @-@ style installation by pressing the file @-@ open button and choose the corresponding file .
the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing , and deleted via back @-@ clicking or remove @-@ button .
inser@@ ting tags will be made in the same way via tool editing , as in the source code editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags , e.g. if an anchor day , surrounded by text , each other creates anchor day will be removed .
some tool@@ bar such as the tables or the lists assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; it is a tool for the examination of style templates . in contrast to other programs for style templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of style pre@@ conditions can be tr@@ acked .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile them except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; # 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the reunion was very complicated because one of the contributors had been made up of many changes and at the same time had corrected the rec@@ ir@@ ation at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the results were numerous conflicts related .
the program used by me showed me only the modified lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the intimi@@ dation had changed . that result of these changes was a small nightmare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white signs . later , any quantity of other useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare quickly text , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the compar@@ ator window .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost to a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way compound is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected outcome . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files at the same time :
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; Cas@@ diff@@ 3 ; perform the folder :
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and serve as a result of the possibilities of current col@@ lateral monitors . if you often have to verify co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and t@@ abl@@ ers are visible are visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if someone is getting the withdrawal . )
when a file is identical , and the other differs in a line then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files are different .
if all files are the same name , but in different folders , then you can ease the ti@@ p@@ work by just writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . for example :
3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3
open dialog allows the manual type of file name , the selection across the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a least open file from the list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be executed .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparing or merge folders is introduced , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; Cas@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the other two folders .
if together , the input field is active and can be applied . however , it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately . you can get this step later on save .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . you can set options before you start working with the default .
sometimes one does not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active compar@@ ator window . the comparison begins immediately . in open dialog you do not need to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the break -@@ button .
you can also use ornam@@ ental and Able@@ ges : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind this ? sometimes a file contains for example multiple similar functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would have been a relatively large amount of effort . you would have to upload two relevant files , they in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can copy the relevant sections simply copy , insert and then compare .
note : at the moment you cannot drag anything from &amp; # 3 ; only the dropping text is supported in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging of text into another program as excer@@ pts and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
in the upper part of each text box is the info line . the info @-@ line of the code window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info @-@ line has a different color . ( when the path leads to a file too long , let the mouse rest a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a , the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed by the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees the color that file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well .
left next to the text there is the constitu@@ ent column . when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the proc@@ essor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line that divi@@ des the composition column of the text is suspended at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the pointer is enabled , the line is dot@@ ted on broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison table ) also has a info @-@ line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; change &#93; when you have worked the result . usually it contains already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ band@@ ed , save is saved ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find stem / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts remaining . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict of manually being solved .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( thus , a jump from the position in the windows is displayed . ) This group is then highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes , by automatic merge or by manual do no more line will be left in the group ; then , in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no line is displayed in the file ; it is only a wild@@ card in the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er you might want to copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; performance conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if the sources list the options to ignore or ignore ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navig@@ ates navig@@ ates mainly with the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you &apos;re in one of the windows , you can also use the arrows left , right , end , Str@@ g @-@ begin and shr@@ g end , si@@ w like you can also use it from other programs . the crossing column next to the vertical image bar can also be used for navigation .
in the Aug@@ mentation window you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ ting button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and re@@ writing mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button , in one of the inter@@ connec@@ tive columns , the view of all windows is synchron@@ ized to the beginning of the respective group ( as described in the section and explained the edi@@ table window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l / C@@ tr@@ l / C@@ tr@@ l ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l / C@@ tr@@ l / C@@ tr@@ l ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l / C@@ tr@@ l / C@@ tr@@ l ) or to the manual . therefore , there must be differences of resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the mark@@ er into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ ts ) . if it is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically copy into the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying falls . be careful with this option but you could write so the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board acci@@ dently over@@ ride .
po@@ inters are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line pop @-@ up \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 keeps the pointer of source files not in , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored to the next start . ( Menu P@@ inj@@ un@@ - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also poses texts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in recur@@ sive script . if the scrip@@ ture does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors might not be available in its pure form , but would be ast@@ ered . on these systems the button settings will automatically be an un@@ just color .
when this option is enabled , the pressing button is inserted in the pressing button with the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab is inserted .
if you input or return Return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board then falls .
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
at the same of files we try to locate all completely identical lines into source files . only during this first step can be ignored white signs . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs will not be ignored . in this step white signs will not be ignored . also , white signs will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon range &apos; \ &apos; r &apos; and a pointer type &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again only save a line sc@@ anning &apos; \ &apos; . when this option is enabled , car returns to be visible , however like a white sign . during the default , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of analysis the numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences will be displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in commentary will be treated like changes in white characters .
intensively searching for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the Autom@@ atically jump @-@ jump mode determines this attitude how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
sol@@ dering automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs are less important in many files . notice that the automatic selection also concerns conflict in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore ignor@@ es C / C + + comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter for sc@@ anning of folders and transmis@@ sions of a compilation . look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and assemb@@ ling .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , then the original version is displayed the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already exist such a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adapting the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to finish &amp; # 3 ; exit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set global across the control center . )
the following codes can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for enco@@ ding appears a short note about what the local co@@ ding is . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . as the co@@ ding is adjustable for each file individually , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding .
if you have processed a file , you can choose which co@@ ding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not be working with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code ) , but this option can only set the co@@ ding output of the output editor command .
turn this off to sup@@ press release changes in white characters in the text or check@@ box . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignor@@ es C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode all the differences are displayed in a color @-@ coded transfer column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ C is indicated next to the normal still a second passing column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the space available on the screen rather for long lines . just add the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
specify the compar@@ isons close to each other or to each other . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide immediately to bring the files together . a simple click starts the gathering and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as the default file name . ( when this function is used to restart the file , then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is presented to this external command first . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that equ@@ ates exactly your requirements . you can use this feature e.g. to cut disturbing parts or to correct the rec@@ ir@@ ation .
when reading a file , it is presented to this external command first . if the command of the command is stated above , then the output of the command is used only when the pointer is used . you can write your own Pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input row must have a corresponding output line .
the thought behind this is to provide the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program it yourself . the good news is however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice .
use this editor command to change the input into large letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ The \ \ 1 in the initial text string . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to add automatically generated character chains ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ ( revision \ \ ) \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ ( revision \ \ ) \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ( \ \ \ \ ) , because $ a special sign is required and the end of the line .
while you experiment with sed experimenting , you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions , even . they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line @-@ up . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos;@@ E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each displaying is replaced by nothing , thus practically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple requirements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions from one another . for example :
instead of sed , you can also use something else like per@@ l usage . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are required at per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the set &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and actu@@ ating . further operations only change the data that may see the line @-@ up al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the pointer is similar to the normal Pre@@ processor command as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or differences hidden , you may not acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers need to edit many files in one folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge .
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate that simul@@ ate and shows the simul@@ ated changes without completing it really ,
... introduces selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is similar to the comparing and merge of individual files very similar . you just need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no target folder was specified , &amp; # 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not result together . to launch this , you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
during inser@@ ting the folder you will be informed of a small news window above the current progress . if you break the sc@@ anning of the folder , only those files are listed until then .
when sc@@ anning the folder is complete , shows &amp; # 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ...
every file and each folder that was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded . you can double click on the + / - click on the object or by using the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and select all sub@@ directories that you can open all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file will be rest@@ art@@ ed and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in column Name reflects the type of file in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the data type is different in the different folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case the contrac@@ tion is not automatically chosen , you will be informed about the problems of this type .
as shown in the above image are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black are used .
with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are regarded as identical if its entire contents is identical . then also folder the same color . with folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf re @-@ green , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , extingu@@ ish the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , extingu@@ ish the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , extingu@@ ish the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of data ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : contradic@@ tory types of file . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this can not merge together .
... A and B does not have the same type of data ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : contradic@@ tory types of file . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this can not merge together .
the mode to syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folders were specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to be identical to that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the result copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are summ@@ ed together and select the new file instead of con@@ duction ( uns@@ afe ) then examines &amp; # 3 ; the date of the files and propos@@ ing the newer file to copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors can not be eliminated , this can not merge the folder .
during the merge one file will work after the others . it &apos;s status column shows D@@ one when the result was successful , and according to other messages , when something un@@ expect@@ edly entered . if that is completed , you should check out a final review and check if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file @-@ method complete analysis is chosen , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ der , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or collap@@ sed . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all of your CV actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can merge it together .
please note : if you have not specified any destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode , C is chosen as the target and will be used to syn@@ cing B and / or B as a destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options given by certain entries to be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid un@@ le@@ aking surprises :
to bring all entries together : choose directories / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut short@@ cut ) . to perform only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if through conflic@@ ting data types still exist invali@@ d actions , a message appears to indicate the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialogue window will appear with the options running , simul@@ ate and abor@@ ting .
select Sim@@ ulation if you only want to see what would happen without the really changes done . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual is necessary ( merge a single file ) then a composite window will open ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select once again directories / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue appears . then , &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next item continues .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , you will find a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you see some error messages that should help you to select the cause of the problem . if you choose this again ( F@@ 7 key ) , lets you choose to select a different action for entry or solve the problem in a different way before you merge with this .
if some entries have been individually merged , these entries ( in the current session ) and then leads them together at the later date . even if here that has been assembled or not saved , these entries will change as settled . only if you change the merge action , these entries are brought together again .
the settings menu of &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set ... ) now has a section called directory sheet with these options :
only files which apply to the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . if you separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid space @-@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( eg * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default directory is * . folder do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders conform to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid space @-@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders conform to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid space @-@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many self @-@ gener@@ alized files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a version@@ . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a post@@ ulate score marked as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in the default .
with links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when left to folder : when the option is switched on , the links like normal folder will be dealt with and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; not checking on possible recur@@ ren@@ sions . a link to a folder of a link on himself would lead to a final loop and &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; pl@@ unges . ) This option is switched off in the default .
a complete analysis of each file through and displays statistics columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple bin@@ ational analysis , and essentially slower if they are applied to files that does not contain text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
when you compare major folders via a slow network , it may possibly be faster , just change the change date and the file size . however , this speed system will cost you a certain amount of security . please use with caution . this option is rep@@ lic@@ ated in the default .
similar to a change of change . there is no real comparison instead of . the files are considered identical if they &apos;re identical . this can be useful for example when copying the chan@@ gel@@ ing date . please use with caution . this option is rep@@ lic@@ ated in the default .
activ@@ ates the syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder . in this mode , the proposals will be summ@@ arized so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results from the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default .
if there are differences , instead the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this will be considered uns@@ afe because it &apos;s knowledge that the other file is not also changed . you should consider it in any case . ) This option is switched off in the default .
if a file or folder is replaced by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and will get the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merge individual files , not just the merge whole folder . this option is switched on in the default .
normally the folder can merge together with the merge individual files visible ; you can switch the window @-@ divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the option directory in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file by means of double @-@ clicking it . however , you can also merge a single file directly without the folder file . once you save the result , the status will be done and the file will not be assembled once you launch the folder .
however , this status will be lost when you re @-@ read the directory once again : list menu : new read
KDE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders for opening up on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder in a closed archives with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a couple of things you should note :
a path can be relatively und@@ o@@ und@@ . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ illed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank boxes &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a brief list of constraints :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder indicates . then there is always a file as a link target . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) .
there is no way to process privileges or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note the option of trust in size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of reference is currently available as differences @-@ spect@@ ator in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always starts the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences @-@ viewer and then select In Cre@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part , the input file is a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then , &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files needs to exist . then starts &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the context menu , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files since the creation of the patch file have changed .
if &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part carried out , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that merge or the comparing folders is not supported in the box mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ is it comp@@ are ) already exists . also the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 out of the Di@@ ff Tool @-@ Tool .
I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by playing in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or so go .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be disclosed to the correct pre@@ fix for KDE . in the default configuration , configure / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more detailed information about this topic .
if only the number of white signs are different , these lines are treated as identical . however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is considered not identical . if similar lines are used next to each other , this the is the purpose this is the case .
the editor will remember any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking into the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is however lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is a lot of effort to design additional a separate file format which could save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can re @-@ establish a specific version through selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text should be used , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ted ; no sr@@ c appeared and the text does not delete . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already use many colors for the up@@ lifting of differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and mis@@ ses the purpose . use another editor for it .
lots of good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to make use of all functions of &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
for information about how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE , you can find on the homepage .
a list of the latest modifications can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the qu@@ ell package .
to compile &amp; check@@ m@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; car and autom@@ ake is used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists thereof .
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or switching ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or switching ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current Cur@@ tain position or replaces the current mark@@ er .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders , and consequently do not appear in the folder folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read changes to these options the folder with the function Re@@ fresh . )
these files are only displayed to display the differences . that also results that identical files do not already exist in the target folders . if the target folder these files will not already exist , they are missing after that . ( the behavior will probably be updated in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in the default folder .
note the buttons on selecting the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if the lines already exist ) , they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ camp ; displays a thumb@@ look of all virtual working spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ space to change their size , they end or move it . this works both inside a desktop and at several .
the &amp; k@@ camp ; can display all virtual work surfaces , as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved to work space and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other working spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; then , the context menu has only the two entries of P@@ ager ... and ending . if however , click on an application inside of &amp; kis@@ ses ; then , the context menu and the name of the application and the entries are minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , on working surface and ending . the commands make the following :
maxim@@ izing the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if applied to an application .
is this cross box marked , can windows inside the bed @-@ camp ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working spaces are moved .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual working spaces are displayed .
ti@@ cking this field leaves the bed @-@ camp ; the numbers of virtual work@@ space are displayed . together with name , it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with Ord@@ in@@ al@@ numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each work surface is also displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ camp ; it is displayed .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; box . otherwise , only the empty work@@ space will be shown to make their choice .
here , the view of the program window is selected . simple spelling with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : pix@@ map is only recommended for very quick systems .
here can be the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window ; in a 2@@ x@@ n @-@ buttons , how from P@@ ager applications appear in some other wind@@ ow@@ els ; wa@@ vering shows all virtual working spaces in a horizontal and vertical set , which is very good for displaying lateral on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ ature in the control panel . he has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying the windows as symbols or with its content . besides , it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button in the box ; and then select the switch @-@ up ... let the dialog settings appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog Settings . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. Falls you do not have to register as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must register the key wind@@ ow@@ der@@ mode and assign values to this .
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need a functioning installation of the KDE properties .

&amp; k@@ likes ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced with new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
when you like , start a window like above . the main window of &amp; k@@ likes ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as magni@@ fying window .. The image that is displayed in the magni@@ fier window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , enlarged &amp; crit@@ erion ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a mobile light . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ likes ; to make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window ) or the environment of the mouse cursor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the pointer is displayed in the enlarged window , select the set of mouse @-@ cursor . please note that this is still not able to detect the shape of the mouse @-@ cursor . this is always the standard col@@ der ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selection window , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button depressed , so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fier and shift . this also goes with the arrow buttons .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; push @-@ down or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can postp@@ one the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left @-@ left corner of the selection track remains firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ likes ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , to copy a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts or stopping the update of the display . the St@@ opp@@ en of updating causes the required CPU time against 0 .
choose the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , low , means , high , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ likes ; automatically uses your sub@@ set @-@ by @-@ command to store files , opening a new window , prints , new@@ ts ( with the button ) again load again in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and shr@@ ubs &amp; etc .
chew@@ ing also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use one area of the screen to be seen in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefits : from research or artist to Web@@ designer or visual impair@@ ment .

&amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte ; em@@ ulate a mouse @-@ click as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor for a while on the same spot is har@@ dened . it is thought to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and those of any mouse clicks prepar@@ es pain .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte tool ; em@@ ulates just a mouse click on the same spot . it is thought to help people experiencing the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in@@ ist In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syndrome and where any mouse clicks prepar@@ es pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this does however require a little practice .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte tool ; can handle the pain that comes when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without hurt . unfortunately , you can also encounter pain that are linked with the use of your computer , if this is not yet done .
to clarify things again : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte , pain helps to avoid using the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by the mouse due to the mouse , useless . and as with all the ergonomic means , the result can vary for each other .
the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte tool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte ; monitors your mouse movements and causes a mouse @-@ click as soon as you break the motion in short .
is the intelligent wir@@ ing activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte ; a break after it puts the mouse button down . now move the mouse , wa@@ its right down until the end of the movement , before getting the mouse button down . this way , you can carry out the pulling off button . the intelligent wir@@ ing requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly to it .
this distor@@ tion period must be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte ; one mouse click out .
is intelligent wir@@ ing switched on , the swi@@ vel right time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set to drag the &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte ; after downloading the mouse @-@ mouse , before it leaves the mouse again , if there is no time for mouse on the mouse .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte tool . this function is now activated , creates a slow step after right and back , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . a slow step after left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte tool ; the first time will be started , but they can be modified later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the reaction time . to do so , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the answer .
is this setting marked , becomes &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte tool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; at the moment , this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de . please check the respective documentation at the rate to find out how to automatically launch a program .
sets all settings on the values adjusted when opening the dialogue . have you already pushed the button , the settings will be reset to the state after the latest release .
the best way to use you &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte ; first of all , you should let off the smart settings . if you then click to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the smart step .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the responses of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse @-@ click without effect stays : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not display a link , does not lead to unauthorized reactions . you can therefore park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse rests , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse gel but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you must remove the mouse gel . as this happens , mouse to mouse differently . it should be quick , however , if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;ll have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling can be easily scrat@@ ching with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte ; if there is just a sliding run@@ way . if you &apos;re in this case the intelligent wir@@ ing means that the surgery can no longer quit through the slogan of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte ; under a different window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can perform yourself a mouse click . this is reset to &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte , and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte ; continue to perform mouse clicks and puts the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it . however , you don &apos;t want to use the mouse on a neutral section of desktop , if you are a sc@@ at@@ ure@@ tic reactions . so you can &apos;t make sure that the mouse @-@ cursor is un@@ seas@@ oned reactions . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are un@@ seas@@ oned reactions . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart hiding place , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent wir@@ ing is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very likely to copy text to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and move it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or move into any other action , in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . but there will be some advice about it :
don &apos;t use the intelligent wir@@ ing if you just begin using &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte tool . select text instead like this : lead the mouse button depressed , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and then push the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . thus , any sound is played like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the smart reloc@@ ating the reloc@@ ating time . later , you can use the intelligent wir@@ ing even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte ; it needs to be the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Wind@@ ow ; it should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and speaker , and that is correct .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte tool . pressing the mouse once the mouse @-@ cursor is short @-@ har@@ dened . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and where the actu@@ ating of the Mau@@ est pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tte tool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button starts . in this way can even the pulling and deriv@@ ative with the mouse can be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the dum@@ b user to let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk of propositions which are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the assistant ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) enter the command one which is later used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the furniture .
on the second page select the default text agent . from the text@@ books you can often use text passages without having to type in . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) you determine the dictionary for the wording . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . additionally you can choose the wording of each word using an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included into the wording .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially a input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ phy of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a verb@@ ose memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you are k@@ mouth ; properly built , you can enter the sentences you want . each spoken set is attached to the exp@@ ires . you can select from propositions which are to be spoken again .
with the menu @-@ entry settings k@@ mouth ; establish ... open the setting dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog includes two cart@@ on cards , voice output and settings , the site Wor@@ ter@@ s@@ cription and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the box menu , enter the command to the call of the language generators . in the selection field below the input field , you specify the character enco@@ ding which is provided with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the cross box if the text should remain unchanged as default to the language generator .
if the cross box is not selected , the text is shared as parameters . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to voice output is dependent on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
as a voice service is used as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings are available on this page . the kt@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications is a stand@@ ardis@@ ed interface for voice output . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text enco@@ ded book or in the box for text enco@@ ded books .
with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and added in addition to the expiry of the input box . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is only entered into the input field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editor allows you to determine whether the text agent will be automatically saved at the closing of the editing pane . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when selecting text enco@@ ders , the book will be saved . if you choose any changes , the text agent will not be saved . select Pri@@ ces , will ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text agent shall be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ s@@ ation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wording . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can choose the currently used dictionary to select words .
with the buttons on the right side , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries to the order of the books , or to export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name in the input field and in the selection field .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by paragraph of occurrence . in addition , you can refer to the word list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries to merge , and how these are to be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you attach a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new words automatically entered into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window for the processing of text enco@@ ded books is divided into two . in the upper part , the text@@ books are displayed as tree @-@ structure .
in the lower part you can edit a select entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the related short@@ cut . if you have selected a text agent , you can only change its name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actions like new text passages or books , or remove selected text passages and books you can either get through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the order of text enco@@ ded books or text passages , you can change with your mouse to the new place or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ button .
the chosen text is cut out and copies into the cli@@ p@@ board . in the input field , a text @-@ section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ires .
the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . in the input field , a text @-@ section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ires .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the exp@@ ires .
if this menu @-@ entry is crossed , a post@@ able tool@@ bar is displayed for frequently used commands . by mouse click on the editing window directly below the menu bar . by mouse @-@ click on the refined left side and pulling the tool@@ bar to be moved to another position .
if this menu @-@ entry is crossed , a narrow leaf in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu has been crossed , a post@@ able leads for text enco@@ ded books with entries displayed . the Le@@ x is arranged by default on the editing window directly below the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the refined left side and pulling the tool@@ bar to be moved to another position .
probably you have entered the command for the language issue not correct or not completely entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; establish ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the box card . ( see the setting dialog for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to further details . )
Festival is a language issue at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ tically supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and re@@ distribute it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Festival in the / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; wel@@ ded language generator . currently , he only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to re@@ distribute it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wav@@ ep@@ y , therefore you need an additional program to cr@@ ush the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to transform the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to send the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore elaborate than in the other examples :
( Cat - echo ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MO@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ ed / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data will be switched as default .
the voice output video on &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ continue language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard section for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the adjustment of the language generators is used only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the setting dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for language generator ) , but it depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak to print text by the calcul@@ ator . a list is already saved @-@ up sentences , which can re @-@ output the user again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer includes . on the machine a language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers must be installed .

before you are able to use it , you will need to install and setup the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
at the first start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s or as long as no speaker is set up , the card holder will be displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one spokes@@ man , the card holder is displayed at least . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that are referred to in volume or speed . you can at least set up several variations for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a spokes@@ man before calling &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , as the speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the default ones .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer spo@@ ols for the same printer .
if you click on the card @-@ rated speaker in k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the card card speaker is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you launch k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and not yet a spokes@@ man .
all already furnished speaker appear in this list . the preferred speaker shows above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not exist a spokes@@ man .
with a mouse @-@ click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse @-@ click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse @-@ click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list determines also their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
select a m@@ oods here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , appears on the new speaker on the card card speaker . to change the settings of this microphone , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card holder regularly and check if voice output is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text in order to create text messages and to manage text . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can launch the language output system of &amp; k@@ de . click on the card @-@ rated General to open this cardboard card . here you can set some general options .
select this cross box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops . this start successfully will display the KDE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this start is successful , the card orders will be added and you can create text orders and read it . see the mark@@ er , K@@ TT@@ SD is hal@@ ted and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de .
when k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , as long as the field voice output is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
is this cross box marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr appears when reading automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , break , stop and resume .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; read cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch to the spokes@@ man for an order .
click to use or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides .
the card card orders is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card @-@ rated General and activate a voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the displayed page . first check the text that is to be read and select in the main menu tools text . after a short while the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step also , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pr@@ elo@@ ad and other invisible brands also have been read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; then you can read the text you can read . first check the text that is to be read and select in the main menu tool@@ box text . then the language output should start .
this also works when &amp; Kate ; in other applications is embedded like &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; .
note : the C@@ notification is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; that will notify you of you specified events . you can read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ ops .
in &amp; conversation ; the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can create various types of messages . for example set up , you can be notified when you appear in a IR@@ C channel in which your nickname can be found . with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can then read the IR@@ C communication text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ noti@@ fy , appears a menu item notification in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Note differ depending on the application .
filter for string qu@@ itting provide a good opportunity to correct in &amp; twe@@ et ; it &apos;s a good example . you remove the tags br and b from the news , the k@@ mail , and additionally the expression / local / In@@ box , since this can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops . for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not necessary .
in fil@@ tering , text will be edited , before being sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation in order to choose wron@@ gly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to byp@@ ass certain shortcomings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dispute &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; sets four types of text .
the output of screen saver has the highest priority . it will pass on all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the Screen Re@@ aders is read , the orders are res@@ umed .
warning have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is becoming hot@@ ly reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and regular text . these orders are continued after the release of the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message interrupted normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . while you want to read a long text on a website , you can welcome to &amp; k@@ mouth ; somebody who just enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; messages also are news . read about it .
the rest are simple text orders . each order that you encounter from the cart@@ el card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output longer texts that have no special urgency .
all four order types are lab@@ eled in queue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre@@ reads , this issue will be stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen devices . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News applied .
filter parameters the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there can be even further types of filters .
inser@@ ters replace parts of a text by other text . the sub@@ set parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . it will be delivered with pre@@ defined strings as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; mail ; in a better understanding .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to a different format . within the scope of &amp; D ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with Interphone editors you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you have set a female voice for example , you can read text by KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it will apply for a language issue . if the filter does not indicate that its rules cannot apply , he continues the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; message on &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be sent to them by all activated filters which have been set up on the page below . the editing through the filters takes place in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of standard normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not active and is not used . filter are lab@@ eled down from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be displayed further below the following setup .
a list of words or regular expressions are required to enter a list of words or regular expressions . these patterns will be found in the text , then the text will be replaced with the corresponding sub@@ stitution text . large and micro@@ sensitive is not considered when compared .
type your filter a name . you can choose this name as you like , but you just have to distinguish yourself from the name of the other filter .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replaces it in accordance with the string chain from the column . the list is shown in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
using these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries will be app@@ ended from the file to the existing list .
here is a language entered , the filter is only applied when the speaker is used for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed .
here is a value entered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID @-@ ID programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers you have to we@@ ave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID @-@ ID @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you only have to enter copies of copies .
the inser@@ tion filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions are applied with an entry in the box Di@@ d filter if match . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words the character filter det@@ ector is used in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( space characters ) .
in this hand@@ book you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions are installed , you can call him in the di@@ alogs or editing them as help to summ@@ arize these expressions . &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions are available in the package Clear .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the help program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient @-@ variable P@@ AT@@ H , it is also ranges x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the speaker @-@ op@@ filter you can send texts to a certain speaker who is set up on the card holder , or to a spokes@@ man with certain properties . you may , for example , specify that text by mail from a female voice should be read . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text to the filter is given , it looks for a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker features that the program proposes that the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; send , and the characteristics of the speaker set on the card holder cons@@ ented . with the speaker @-@ free filter you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
here is a value listed here , the filter is applied , in case the text contains the integrated regular expression . is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions , you can call this by clicking on the button to get help you enter .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression in the beginning of the string , that is , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the characteristics of the desired microphone . if the text comp@@ lies the filter conditions above , the speaker will be selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view the dialog selection .
use these buttons to store or load your spokes@@ person or delete all settings .
the speaker can apply only to the text if all conditions are applied with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if necessary . you must register at least one condition .
the voice output API , of &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers to give their applications T@@ TS @-@ capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ops ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is are available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications ask for voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the submission to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
in doing so , text of the text is to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands give you
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Wind@@ ow . start t@@ ect@@ on in a window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Per@@ former@@ filter , but when using the module for Festival , web pages will not be read .
due to a mistake in festival 1,@@ 95 beta you will need to install the ( male British ) Voice of Rab _ di@@ phone to make S@@ able at all . that &apos;s why you do not have to do that , if you do not use this voice for reading web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and about the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences is displayed , or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish , what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure the option is set on the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string test filter . see below .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand on the use of another syn@@ thes@@ iser , you can contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile and compile ; do you need a current development environment of KDE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages of c@@ ess@@ or@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you get the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source texts , or you have downloaded the tar@@ ball all night , translate and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; use , check first if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher operates correctly with your language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . to this end , you can use the shell script .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops . the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be developed so that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the user SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ semb@@ led into individual sentences . the user may repeat Sat@@ z@@ - or decl@@ ining , repeat , repeat the output or ab@@ ort .
if an application is text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; moreover , it can request a female speaker &apos;s properties for the output . if you have a spokes@@ man , whose language English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise , the best fitting speaker is chosen . if you want to find out more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; a spokes@@ man chooses to see you in .
if you click on the card card present@@ er to add , and then click on editing a spokes@@ person to the list or click on editing , the box card speaker will be shown . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter a festival .
select the text enco@@ ding for text , which is passed to the festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops . in general , this setting is automatically made . generally , Western languages ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , Austrian languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you provide volume , intercom speed and pitch of synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some shelf and displayed these grey , the voice you choose not to choose from you .
some votes like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes may need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this cross box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( on large storage use ) the first sentence is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this tide can not be selected , you have not yet set up a spokes@@ man ( or do not forget to apply ) . see .
if this cross box is marked , it is visible at the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s the program window . otherwise it is visible after the start only the symbol k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this cross box is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is not yet installed , it appears in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to keep reading or to control otherwise .
here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application which has set the order , the current status of the contract , the number of propositions and the right set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can fill @-@ in on the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in settings ( also on the other cardboard cards ) will be taken over and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the section section . click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card audio . see also .
here only text orders are performed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either without support for the respective audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul compiled or &amp; kt@@ ops ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de will be used for the audio @-@ output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . have you selected Al@@ sa , select the PC@@ M device here . see also
set the intercom velocity here . 50@@ free ; % correspond to approximately half and 200@@ free ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x .
click to use the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; to take over the system .
the list of al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
this card holder allows you to set special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen saver has the highest priority . it will pres@@ cribe to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the Screen Re@@ aders is read , the orders received are res@@ umed .
warning have the next first priority . this level is important news such as it eg ; processor is becoming hot@@ ly reserved . a warning keeps the output of news and regular text . this orders will continue after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrupted normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that addresses news . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can welcome to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless anyone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audi@@ ting output is a queue in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory news is active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card map only apply to normal text orders . for messages , warnings and spending on screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to pre @-@ read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ noti@@ fy messages can be read , launch k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s and click on aler@@ ts . the card card aler@@ ts appears .
select this cross box to turn the pre@@ read of &amp; k@@ de ; alter@@ ations . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications .
is this setting marked , messages will be aler@@ ts where a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read beforehand .
use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nickname .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops . ignored .
use this selection to specify what &amp; kt@@ ops . do if an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following documents :
you can enter the properties of the desired microphone . default chooses the speaker who is listed in the list on the card card speaker as the top entry . see also .
bear in mind that there are three levels for events . if for a certain event a particular application is specified , this will be executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of certain application . as the last possibility , the action is made for wearing , which is specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the default aler@@ ts like this :
use the button to save the settings for noti@@ fications into a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries except all disadvantage will be cleared .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , the speaker speed , the volume , the sex voice and the pitch . also marks for the control of pron@@ unciation by for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently &amp; kt@@ ts . SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the default ones , the festival is used in the SS@@ ML edition .
if the settings for speed or sound in the Festival configuration dialog is not limited to 100@@ nbsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and satellite filters ( SD@@ A filter ) . SB@@ Ds can start reading text in single phrases . this can only be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also jump in or withdraw from card orders , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers does not directly support this .
here you can see the satellite connection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a demonstration filter . you can change its settings , or add further satellite characteristics , but beg@@ inner from it .
in the easiest way you learn the setting of inter@@ sex selection by trying out . place the speaker choices here , change some features and check how the selection of the microphone changed . this requires , of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start to start reading , since only the first sentence must be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long time ,
you can then stop or inter@@ rupt the card orders , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal typ@@ ology filter is automatically set up , if you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s for the first time . it can not be switched off , just removed . change nothing about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
satellite character filters compare text with a regular expression for typ@@ ing and add a tab ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the typ@@ ing limits ( tab ) before the fil@@ tering automatically from the text ) . notice that the standard satellite wr@@ apping filter will be attached .
SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages , warnings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders .
if you have removed from Ver@@ see the normal typ@@ ology filter , you can insert it again by loading the file _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ops .
on the card holder &apos;s choice , you can write the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card holder ) . in other words , no inter@@ sex features are set .
use of the most suitable microphone , which shows all the properties of an equipped intercom . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the microphone , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from , the most commonly asked features .
select the method for entering the desired speaker properties , by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired microphone . if this property does not matter , do not give anything .
highlight this cross box when the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several marks here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , this property will always use as a priority property . the only case in which you may want to specify the attribute language , is before you know that a particular application has been sent in a different language other than that of the working environment .
to use all the properties in the area of spokes@@ man , to delete the following , click the default ones and then use to be spokes@@ man , which is most suitable to the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the entry 0 required ) .
k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes away when it is started . I have completed Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get back @-@ up .
G@@ stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was probably finished . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer yet . when the problem is not solved , maybe a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio edition above Al@@ sa doesn &apos;t work when I play music at the same time with another application . if I hold a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at Al@@ sa that prevent a simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have downloaded an additional voice for the Internet from the internet . I have installed them and I can use them at the festival , but this voice does not show that voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / share the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you found the voice to the developer .
on the box card Audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be noticeable over the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer a setting of speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the intercom velocity will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ops . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . SS@@ ML has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are completely brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l @-@ file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML Um@@ br@@ aces , and set the intercom speed up .
I don &apos;t manage to read web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 , the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . thus the festival does not produce any error , the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ but the gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate string test filter and now I can go into &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ a pre@@ - or backward . on the cart@@ el &apos;s orders is shown , the order only goes out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation ( point , frac@@ tional sign , comm@@ ing , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not be fil@@ tered . use this character instead of a filter for the lim@@ it@@ less detection .

in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 is the module &amp; arts , probably removed or at least created on request .
the following modules for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of these possess a run @-@ time dependence of non @-@ free software .

as an default setting ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed , this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you need to specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example
on Debian systems / usr / local is the right folder for programs which are translated from sources .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; use , check first if your language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers is working properly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is disclosed . the quality of the voices is generally good and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can set volume , intercom speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with Festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) Voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission .
this voice comes ahead of 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in a early stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / CA / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ i ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) co@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; - distri@@ butions therefore first look for the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the enco@@ ding must be adjusted to ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . then , Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio @-@ output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; - voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full language output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates voice from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables the administration of network interfaces , the routine and the DNA settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings over a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be viewed through selection of K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module for network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; display the module settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched through selection of c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have to be fully installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and enables setting the network features .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices at the Inst@@ alling &amp; Linux ; are installed and installed . networks are later added , the drivers have to be loaded via adaptation of the following files , according to the core version , are loaded :
the module settings will be loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module , it tries to detect the platform used on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be detected , the Custom &apos;s selection is offered . it is the platform out of the list that the distribution and the release version is best corresponds to . selecting the setting up non @-@ re @-@ ask the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , then this selection will be automatically set .
changing the network settings is possible only in system @-@ administration mode . previously all options are displayed grey , which means the settings can be viewed only , changing it is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the total functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab :
the tab network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . from the tab network , the following tasks can be performed :
setting up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... setup the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advanced Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings and displays the dialogue with further options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by selecting Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is required for each system start , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selection list can be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
with the selection Manu@@ ell can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field . in the input field , network mask is determined .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface with the boats . if the initi@@ alization does not wish , this option should not be activated .
the values used in this dialog are displayed as attributes of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or off @-@ off according to demand . switching on an integrated network device is provided by selecting from the list and click @-@ click interface ....
network devices can be activated or off @-@ off according to demand . off @-@ off of a activated network device is made by selecting from the list and click of the interface .
sets the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks .
if the computer is present more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network , where the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses . if the machine htt@@ p includes htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS det@@ ector this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator to the naming solution part of the rider &apos;s naming allows an easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified .@@ DNS entries can be re @-@ ordered by selecting a single inser@@ tion and execution or gra@@ dation in the list with the buttons or can be arranged in the priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the naming solution a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the dialog New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from group calcul@@ ator to naming a list , select an entry and then click the button Edit .... It will display the dialog .
the list of a well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes machine @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when the DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server .
normally the list contains a well known calcul@@ ator , some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these are still in the test available version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP @-@ address of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator and click Add ... The dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has multiple ali@@ as name , the button add several times and enter the other ali@@ ases name .
select a name of a name , name of a name and choose Edit .... The dialog of your computer will be displayed .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then by clicking on OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings specified in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of the binary distri@@ butions ( mostly r@@ pm packages ) it is sufficient when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphi@@ cally surface such as co@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other libraries are required .
this is recommended for only experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modify configuration files .
this section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is conve@@ yed in a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great circulation . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description focuses on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is assign to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator that applies to a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be easily chosen .
when putting your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the internet , therefore its any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by hiring a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the two @-@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the standard route is required for the IP re@@ direc@@ ting .
the unit address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . usually , the address is 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes altered in DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of an active DSL connections to other content than specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file will be sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it has the possibility to set up several archives on a tape . the first purpose was to answer a surface for tar which presented my wife &apos;s ability : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat : rep@@ ent the band and reads the pre @-@ tension details of the bonds . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the demonstration on the tape does not , you are asked if the band is to be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the for@@ er@@ aman is looking for the right index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index must be created anew .
everything went smoothly , changes the icon for the tape &apos;s work to indicate that the band is involved . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the belt can now be searched out by em@@ blem of the entry for the band .
before leaving the Bank , first the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a change of the symbol for the band to realize that integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be cast out without danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted .
a Band@@ arten must be format@@ ted before you have to be used for storing data . this procedure does not require the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not have to happen before you pass from the volume of &amp; k@@ dat files . Flo@@ ppy drives are usually set up a format@@ ting of the ban@@ ces , DAT drives , however not .
after entering the belt name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the bonds . all the data on the tape are lost . after completion of the format@@ ting , the volume is automatically involved and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you have to select the most secure files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved to this file or the folder .
highlight a backup profile in a tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in local file tree with a h@@ ooks . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
please click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu Si@@ go@@ l ...
once the backup started is opened , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears to backup . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives on the drive for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in an entry for the band with a h@@ ooks . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives in one of the archives and select the test entry ...
once the test process has been started , the dialog settings for verification . in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the work@@ space for the check .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialogue appears super@@ v@@ ise . this dialogue shows the progress of the process and the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before you can restore the Rest@@ ore , the files that are to be restored will be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that are included for the tape &apos;s work . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a h@@ ooks . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the work@@ space for the recovery .
when you confirm the settings for restoration , dialogue appears to be re@@ generated . this dialog shows the progress of the progress process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re@@ generate the band &apos;s inde@@ x@@ file from the band &apos;s content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing Inde@@ x@@ file for this band . you can re@@ generate the index on two types from the band :
this is a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should be made . the list of secure files will be automatically updated according to the selected work folder .
for all files listed under backup files , is considered only the files currently being stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder , which are on other fil@@ esystem , you can list separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from tar independently of the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files stored since then have changed .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling from tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons are fet@@ tered ; and lt ; lt ; files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings on the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to device processing ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ one version of the belt system .
is this setting active , conve@@ yed &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is involved the command will be fl@@ us@@ hed to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
is the option enabled , tries to block &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the re@@ pro@@ ach in the belt drive . possibly this attitude does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , in solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat files ; automatically the band is ej@@ ected . do not use this option with flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers .
is the option enabled , tries to change &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable blocks sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band &apos;s drive will communicate .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the belt . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n ) The band ID . the format of this string is calcul@@ ator : seconds , where calcul@@ ator the full name of the system is format@@ ted on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file named in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not the incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup job . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; the viewer is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . moreover , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where to get information about your system or where the system is stored in the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features , with their help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following scre@@ enshot , presents &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions at your disposal , with their help the single log lines of a log file easily filter and sort out . the individual possibilities for sorting and filter are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries to open &amp; amp log ; first the main protocol @-@ file of the system - the system Protocol - is not displayed , and it opens instead of a small news window , so you have &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; very probably not with system management rights . the protocol files usually do not have a permission to read for the normal user .
you can also filter the filter bar in order to filter on a selected crit@@ erion or according to the fil@@ tering string . in the default setting , the drop @-@ down list contains next to the filter . in the default setting , the selection box contains next to the filter that is displayed once , when in one of the columns the string of the filter is included .
you can of course select a different entry at this point . select the string process using the entries in the selected column . select for example in the filter bar the name of a process , so showing you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a sp@@ ic@@ uous color than protocol lines of level critic . the colored description of protocol lines can be switched off furniture dialog .
if you want to show only certain process ( for example in the system protocols or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can test the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you can use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option for new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub @-@ windows and manage . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol for viewing .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information on the supply sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you will also find in the following directory of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion Archives : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; - Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system develops fast to the standard for control of the program starts at the high level of the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ der is below / s@@ am and not below / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to put a machine on System V In@@ it without a re@@ installation and new format . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder means r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service that you would like to start the system or change to another running level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ tes , which is just started once . such calls include r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems own this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something that has to do with the serial connection .
the kernel looks for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the standard Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line in the beginning as the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably determine that the default running level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you have done something through , then you come repaired by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how do you start all the correct scripts ? if you ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that no correct files are in this folder . instead , each entry is here a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it &apos;s an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would keep the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it includes a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will be called with the argument .
some people wish to set up a simple way of running machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level , which leaves just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . , in addition , I could also have a user @-@ running level , which starts &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the area of your dispos@@ able system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or to stop ) .
you can also shift scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the area of the disposable system services .
note : entries are moved if you want to drag them into a new area . to copy them on a new Run@@ level , you must select copying from the menu or paste from the context menu -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to include system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( avail@@ ables , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X use ) and add it into the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an item manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of loss of data , all entries in the menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I &apos;ve been experimenting with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ IL@@ O Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for the execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
the way systems are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary interface programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all the configuration files are available , which are required of the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just quit without notice if their configuration files are not available or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; c@@ user ; start it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you made changes , you must save it . either use the icon of the tool@@ bar or entry save in the menu file .
&amp; B user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user interface and the user group . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user interface or group characteristics .
some cart@@ on cards are only shown if you have enabled space settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cardboard card will be made , where you can make individual settings . other card cards appear , if shadow codes , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD boxes .
the card @-@ card password appears , if shadow codes , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card @-@ card only appears when activated and initi@@ alizing ( Qu@@ ota ) file ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alizing ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , for each user parameters can be modified , the amount of information in the KB include :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by the field file fil@@ esystem with space limit .
the card holder provides information on the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user is heard , can be a member in the field of primary group . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by changing them in the large field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add of the menu User or group or click the matching button of the tool@@ bar . editing or dele@@ tion of the selected user or the selected group will be an@@ alog@@ ous .
with this module you can install the L@@ IL@@ O boot manager to remove the Boot@@ Pass@@ word , remove and change the time until the default operating system , remove the standard business system , remove , change the operating system , change , change and more .
