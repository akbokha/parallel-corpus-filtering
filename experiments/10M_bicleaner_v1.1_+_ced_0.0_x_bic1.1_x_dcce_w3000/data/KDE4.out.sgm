<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated to the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations are not making important decisions depending on the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the babelfish page by yourself where you can insert the lyrics directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package includes different modules for & conqueror; in spite of their small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & conqueror, by making them easier available.</seg>

<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Conqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / Directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for various symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The particularity of & FSView; consists of portrayed Ordnerhierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportionate to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a folder or folder, the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is defined in it. thus, large files can be recognized even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView can be seen as a graphic and interactive version of the UNIX Basics that you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Trees-presentation represents a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. to facilitate navigation, the riangles have reasonable colour-finding and slogging settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched on screen mode, can be either a depth of the slight detection of the nesting stee or the illustration of a different file as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can specify whether enough space is available at all or if the area is used by subordinate rectangle (where, consequently, you can define the relative position of the signment in the rectangle).</seg>
<seg id="19">In case algorithms for treemaps, the surface should be respected that the area is proportionate to the size of the entry. at the Treo in & FSView; this objective is not always observed. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is quadratic.</seg>
<seg id="20">As splitting the area of an item for the subordinate entries is left, the implementation remains up. here it is for the complying and avoiding space loss by frame always split the surface so that rectangle is created, which are as square-possible. the best methods of this are rows, columns, or recursive second-release.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal below for an entry over the menu entry view. instead, a smokpattern is drawn into the area of an ordered entry, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>

<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata about how & eg; on the camera or the lens, can be searched over.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also called & digitization; an open source project. that means it is reliant on supporting the end user. they therefore should report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitised: attempts to make the notification of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes. if you use this linkage link, your web browser opens a page in the error-system. all the information you require here is already registered. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also visit digitised: home page to find news on shared versions and other information on & checking; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best way to start to & checking, is the registration in the developer's mailing list. instructions to report in the developer's mailing list from & digiarrived.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you arrived & digitised; for the first time, you will be asked where to store your images and your database. simply enter the name of a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the name of the folder, or click the folder symbol to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data file will be stored. this path remains the same for all the subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later, you can add as many folders as you wish to add. & digitization; will you use in addition as an Albenlibrary. settings digiKam setup collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, the images stored as the base folder. no picture is changed here. during the passage of the folder you will get a progress view like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitisation; thirst for recursively the library path in its whole depth. you cannot exclude any subfolders unless it is in a hidden folder. this can help you to add a point before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as the base folder, you will notice that the albums in my alllist do not take pictures as symbols. you can change it by taking a any photo out of the album and then take this on the folder symbol. further details can be found in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the root folder, you can set in & check; your digital camera set up. then you should learn how to use My albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>

<seg id="73">A simple to-use camera shop is provided to help you connect with your digital camera and convert your photos directly into & digitised. of course, more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by means of library gphoto2. of course, each medium and any card reading which is supported by your operating system will work with & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera will also be realized as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be implemented via the picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digi2. used the program to communicate with digital cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, further distribution collection for digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calculator. since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port slow, this connection has been deprecated by now. & digitised; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of images with gPhoto2 through. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexchange support so that the thumbnails will be read from digikam reliably. the EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2. if the EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to concede anything or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digitization: is how easy it can expand its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plug-in Project (manual) is an approach to develop a joint module structure for & checking;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost any way, as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it's much simpler, & digitised; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in & digicame; even perform.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you can find out more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't even know how many photos you have, then you don't even know how much photos you have, then you definitely don't know & digitised.. the approach the metadata can be saved in both a database and in the image files guaranteed very fast seeking and a secure archiving to you with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and need to know anything about your system is to build information structure unlike the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you have to decide whether other access to your photos may have to store or on a network drives & etc. make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be quickly found via your location. if you have enough photos, then you will use sub-folders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant access of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% Archive and 5% working files have become and you will then not want to re-organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking is easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplify a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you're looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to activate in the settings of metadata in & digitization. this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently be saved the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the corresponding item on the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? it asks and digitised, to them an metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work, since you should now select each photo of keywords, signs and evaluation. of course, you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value. you start best with the rating or the ranking. this makes sense, since you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now let us with keyword, keywords, as you are often called in other programs, or categories continue. all three are synonyme for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalyzed images from a different source with embedded keywords, then & digitised; automatically insert the tree for you or put the pictures to the right place. the resort of hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply drag through the tree of a sub-tree to another. the modified keywords will be replaced by & digitised; updated while the undertrees prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overcut. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section relates to labelling or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to see most anyone your photos simply, they want to share with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start seeing some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing is. wow! you start to dream, associations, the historical time period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so, the marking has changed your perception of this panoramas.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at the title is probably more important than the image themselves to create an interest. if you show images, you should tell a story. remember the key it is the meaning to the viewer to help Him through the motif you move has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect, if it has the strength to act solely with a marking for himself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitised, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. why you can even export your pictures to your wishes in the lettering and / or the title of the web gallery. you have to tell the story for the opening-colors no second time.</seg>

<seg id="172">The author (Synonyms and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person that has created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, such as the name of a company or organisation, it should no longer be changed. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author (synonym for editor): linked to the author. examples of this can be titles as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or Independent photographer. as this is a reference to the author's field, this must be filled out also.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the provider to identify who the photo offers. if the photographer works for a message agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency will be shown here.</seg>

<seg id="177">Themes: plate error, plate breakdown, power violations, ECC, transmission error, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, descent, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we are not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section they are about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data collection in the world, has some interesting statistics, which reasons why a loss of data has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be cautious for longer than a couple of years. of course, you can also get CDs and DVDs in archive quality. of course there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe that is in your Ermessenplayground.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be readable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discs and good recording equipment and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable. it is therefore about choosing the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control mechanism to protect itself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control. despite this massive protection they are used by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratch, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called IsoBuster which seems to do wonders on CDs and DVDs. however, there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray discs appear to win the Formatwar against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost sixsmal the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good reception on high quality media in a non propriated format. if you read the media with a description, date & author, and then on a clean, dark dry and before animals protected place. don't forget the data to copy the next generation of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discarmakers reserve your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's rooms will include a new disk, but not the data. Google presents on this subject a large field study on the error mechanisms of HDDs: Disfaulty study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: strikes hold the longest if you are operated in the temperament area of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C. electronic parts of the Controllers are the commonest fault of error, SMART may not notice the fault of this error. these are in particular readmill and publishing tellers. the expected lifetime period is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just the loss of loss due to tension. of course, you can also make data loss due to electricity if you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be made without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not account much, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause severe damage. on your computer these anomalies were blocked, complete data loss, hardware alterations, expedited motherboards, and other defective. so protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against rapport is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbed part of the energy-load and the rest occurs. it is usually available in the form of a single-line bar. however, remember that not every Steckerbar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protecting it against lightning stroke and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable is used to use your computer, you should be careful that also all peripherals connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protective devices that also contain a phone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable installment protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even an accident of few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile electricity supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Aside from the protection against overtension these devices can provide automatically cordless energy when a power outage occurs. some models allow them to store your data and re-run the system. if you purchase a USV then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the living time of the battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concern the potential risk, exposed to your computer system and compare your safety with electricity disorders using the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can be you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you keep in mind how well your computer protects it. at the end you should always think all the cable trendy before you go to holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the HDDs, but very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost / dollars; 500. in addition, you have to send the data on the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general security solution. however, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online. the professional variant gives you more available, in case of Flickr dramatic more. for 25 $per year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality only.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the backup data, the Web-solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically processed thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies is included in the offer a backup and shares of memory. thus, they are desasterly.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all broadcasts are susceptible to transmission errors. filesystem and btrfs do not at least ensure the data integrations between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred, not when this occurred in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected by you one day, and it's quite disturbing that there should be no protection inside your computer. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data track than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission losses as they generate interference within the data flows. with normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates, which can be circumsable with turntable errors and is highly scalable. it is open source, with many patients and is available under a GPL-compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon also available for Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in alpha-status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that are used and is also available for Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Underestimate this not! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% in job systems. with notebooks, the percentage of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft or reinstallations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: incorrect, NTFS is minimal better than EXT3, routing, JFS and XFS to call the broadsheet file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and loss of data: wrong, just the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an indefinately status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: incorrect, theft and human errors are the major causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural border for this advancement. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 meapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality optics, the optimum size of 6 Megapixel and high quality optics are the Optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else responsible for loss loss. so, so your data is often affected by a loss of data. so secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do anything, like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of plates, or the size of your hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster proposes local and destroys a lot. forget aircraft unhappiness: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterstraction also means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the staircase, into the neighboring building, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a frequent reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files saved. it is a snapshot of history without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference security: a backup of the files changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of at two time points: the total security of the system and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental security: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. they can produce the original status at any time when such a backup was made. this backup comes up to a versioning system next to the exception that it is only off-off and is not permanent.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transcriptions copies rsync only the difference of files that really were changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or any other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you to discover losses and restore it. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of work files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month. any further discharge should be done manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, storage, scalability, media, playback of images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you are really interested in you because they remember your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature is unpredictable, you must consider all that is said today. unfortunately, there is no other possibility as a certain vigilance. all 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switching to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your machine architecture, memory and safety technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means growing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability with and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and shift to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmg if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdc # source code / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the record in MBLES; # works with ext2.3, fat16, 32 and reiron & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiron if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read more, then you can create it yourself. this task will become easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">Gif is a proprietary, patented format slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source Standard developed by the GIF. however, it can be loss, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and Chromesh data for improved color reference for heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and a slow-use compression. this format we would like to recommend you to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss of free computations (Deflate). however, it is very large files. with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types of cameras.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a licence-free and open-format-format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon it at some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why, to replace 2001, Adobe its XML based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a mixture of XML and RDF. file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer the original size of your recording, mostly in the shell format, to archive data. however, there can be problems in the link between the metadata and the image file, and as mentioned above, the shell format will fail. therefore, you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, offering a wide range of applications and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard meetings and enlightened efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reading or the scanner. so long the images on the camera are available, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a subtle process, you can use external programs. if you use the pictures again with & digitised, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut in some circumstances from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then into web galleries, code you into MPEG, use in contact leaflets, print them & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitised. in the add of a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & checking, connect them to the machine, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a Finish indicator is available at the lower end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will display. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file access for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera appear.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the page properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an item or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information that is internally downloaded from the camera. a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. please note that some digital cameras do not provide all the information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. in the picture. this information is the same as in metadata sidebar from the main window of & digitised; or the image processing. please note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All. this invites all photos from her camera to a single album in & digitised. after downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired option with the default options available by & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the button Download and then download Selected. the box selected can be downloaded until you selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is new to download. these pictures have not been downloaded from & digitised. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>

<seg id="258">After you chose the target album, press OK, and & digitised; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by delete the delete button. if you only want to delete a few, then you must select it first and delete them for delete them.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way for photos to recover from the camera. so the photos will not be deleted in the dustbin of & kde; so they should carefully check if the photos may delete them from the camera. if you don't want to delete them from the camera. if you don't want to delete the camera record, this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a file name for the photos frequently not particularly expressive name. the filenames are usually restrained after the photos from the camera. therefore, it can be useful, the date and time when the picture was taken to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirror-based subfolders. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three additional options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different medium-format than standard format, for example in the processing field, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% discount -% M:% S. change the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command stramtime.</seg>
<seg id="265">When you use the camera file name, you will have the option to change the filenames in small letters. or in large letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which the camera came; for a photo, it is shown below the name, which provides the camera in the preview. your settings for rename are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitised; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time-point of recording. not all cameras are ready to install this information. in the page sidebar metadata you can read more details, about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to switch the automatic turning turn, use the button Advanced and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera records information about the date on which the photo was made available, & digitised. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras will provide this information. in the sidebar meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually shut off, and in this case stores & digitization; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change it, you must turn this option. use the button Advanced and select there the option-based shelter at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos of your computer to their camera is the button Download. then select the upload dialog box. you can select the files uploaded, you can select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is completed, asks & digitization; you, where the images are to be uploaded. a folder-selection dialog appears for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to load the uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position that is indicated in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to reincarp an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can easily access a browser which indicates the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitised, user want to locate the place of the photos, or simply want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as direction, Sattelites and card references are supported. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a postprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical assignment (manual) and finally about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receiver. either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: Coyasset Eye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. you have to save this data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from images and from GPS. on the following page you can use the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsphoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitudes or other data, then you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs of hairy coordinates created, e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European street cards. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitization: try to give you as much control over his workflows. there are many attitudes which have the behavior of & digitised. to adjust to these settings, you must log in into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Action may be able to display on embedded preview or image editing. so they place the standard behavior of & digitised; if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IPTC data fields, when the option is selected when downloading the camera registry. also with a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for the editor: this field should be the professional photographer of the photographer. this can be designations such as employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a detailed description of the author, this also must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to specify the picture of the photo. this does not have to be the author, if this is a bearing agency, such as Reuters, or Associated Press, then these organisations should be registered here, then the group or agency that the image will be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC field. this makes the metadata permanently available in the picture and not only in the database of & digitised. these metadata also are available to other programs and can be imported into & digitised; they will be imported without losing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images described as embedded captures (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you've embedded in the pictures, with the images embedded in the pictures. thus, you can also include signs of images, these have already been written by those of & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all the options for the information that appear if the pointer is displayed in the main window above a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitised; supports a number of different image formats, and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digitised. to specify, you can add the file extensions of this list and remove it. Albany folder that has no one of these extensions will be ignored by & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Refresh on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminous of & digitised; it can be switched on this page to the default values. however, some images do not have different sizes and synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole size-type quot; should you only use on quick calculators. if you have one, then you can hereby obtain better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image editing a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select this here. you can switch the toolbar when you use the image editing in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker and brighter color in the image. these colors will be defined here. in the picture editing this picture can be converted with F10 and F11 and turned off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling, it is meant that the pictures are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color formations. please read this article in Wikipedia about further explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting PNG compressing you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation is reduced not the image quality because PNG requires a loss of free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value to a high compression. it means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files compressed you can switch the deflate compression for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality because the deflate algorithm used loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the attitude of loss-free JPEG-2000 files you can cut loss-free. even if you select the loss of loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digitised, the image processing was only a picture viewing for photos. currently it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard anname is that all green pixels are identical. if the line-up green pixel of the CCD sensor can react when pixels with odd lines, this option creates a minimal loss of details. this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details. this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details. this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details. this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details. this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details. this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details. this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details, but the 2x2 Gitterpattern comes with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white is used in the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white sand is not removed. standard is it a fixed color balance, based on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting will be supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps will get more details into the cutting edge. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the cutting-edge so the parts of your images are burned down, because of the inability of your camera records the cutting-edge, as opting white-white results. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the cutting edge.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as quick as green and red. & digiw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still unsaturated blue pixel. of course, this is a question of how much color or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you reconstruct the option, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be adapted for each picture separately.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminanzance to your liking. you probably need to put it slightly higher than the default 1. but this can also be done later in the picture options of & digitisation. to keep the time for the DemosaBicing small, you should proceed conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to convert a complete image from the partial data-data that have many cameras and which is available for a Matrix colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digipah; and Dcraw provide three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it generates farmers in edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color-softening of your lenses, you can put the red and blue-proof values here. this is certainly the best method for a color error correction, since it is carried out during the pipe.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translated the color formations and gives instructions like this again should be given. there is also LCMS and & digitised. information like the color information from a color to the other are to be translated as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour questions, if an image is opened in the image processing / colour administration module with Rohfiles.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile Setting you here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles. & digitised; studies this folder then during the start of the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have the opportunity & quot; standard squot; to deposit for your profiles. everything can be changed while opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour administration view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your pictures rather than the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camera manufacturer and model that you are using. not all profiles are included in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain the color-tone or Gammacorrections. currently, dcraw Gamma is not required for conversions at 16 bit depths. this means you have to perform the color-tone itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile where you can emulate how your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print picture since your printer can be a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore highly satisfied. this could you manually correct instead of leaving the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious that the colour profile is intended for them for what is meant. unfortunately, here is a table of cameras and profiles which fit together. this answer is naturally inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extends the style for the goal: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; picture viewing and image workings supported; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select which you want to use and these modules will then be loaded by & digitised. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will find some also in the context-click menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can set in the menu under settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules you can get over the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slides should be easy to understand. the upper registrar jushes the time between the captions, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other hubs put the metadata or, which at the lower end of the images appears during display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show on the left side a list of all cameras. on the right hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which is trying to identify the camera properly, switched on and in picture-line mode. among them are the portfolios. currently here are the serial, USB- and USB / FireWire-mass storage devices.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras from the camera date. you have to specify the path, / mesh / camera or / mnt / repositories where you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digitised, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring them into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & checking it; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camamodell and port manually. after you have installed your camera, your camera will appear in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will display in the menu cameras of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option of confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; images in the dustbin, you can view the talk of & digitised; in deleting a photo in an album. in the portions of a photo and deleting a album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can still be used by & digitised; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you must use the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also view the display of the welcome screen of & digitised. at the start of the start, this speeds up under circumstances the starting process of & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting of Beim starts searching for new photos & digitised, to search for new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the time folder & digitised. if something was deleted from the base folder, asks & digicome; you, whether it is to delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemas can be used in & digitised; in order to adjust the main window to your liking. these settings can be selected using settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is counted below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for digitised, you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitised; contains a quick image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the posting ads / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitised. therefore, they are not part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules you can find in the picture editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file size, enlarging the size and the current size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the top edge and below the toolbar to access the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing changes your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save it to save the button save from the toolbar. please note that you can no longer revert the original photo once you saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file saving.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the file name file or use the button Restore Restoration in the toolbar. you will lose any change that you have done at the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of the image processing can be undone or recovered. the last action you can revert by choosing machining or reinstated by choosing machining from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to return and make Ctrl; -Sumalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; you can press a moment longer via the return menu or re-manufacture button in toolbar, you will get a right-click menu. if you select one of the menu items, all the actions in between are also undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigational buttons in the toolbar, image high, picture down or the entries in the menu. if you have any changes in the current photo, you will ask if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can get in the photo and out zooming in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the log menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full-screen mode shows the photo in full-screen mode. you come in the normal view, in which you use the Escape key. normally, you can change this in the setting dialog of & digitised. this allows you to view this in the setting dialog of & digitised. you can view this from & digitised. see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the menu File print and get the default & kde; printing dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print some pictures or whole sets. whole image boards can be printed out of your selection. you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Excunt printing. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiball; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigational pair, also available in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five rider is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multifaches Click on the same rider lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the sway view, you can enter ctures with unlimited size or insert. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the signments are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters will be formed. if you want to use the IPTC code field in other applications, you should note these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on, use either the button or simply switch to the next image, the signposts are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the apply button, there is a button which can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata to the files. however, this will always be done if you have a metadata adjustment that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review reveals an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. the evaluation from the sidebar is always used only to one image. to select multiple images simultaneously, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field. coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keywords, and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & check;</seg>
<seg id="362">The keywords will be dynamically adjusted to the word password. you can limit the number of options in finding a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief in entering keyword at a picture series. if you typed different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set through marking the appropriate attachs in the tree. all words of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">When multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keywords, this is only applied to the highlighted image and not on the whole selection, If you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar point filter is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and viewpoints. if in addition one or more keyword filter is used from the right side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull out tags and drop it. suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view, so you can drag it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then, a dialog that you asks if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window displays the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter stands on no sampling, which reduces the amount of three images. they were drawn with Ctrl + a and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword on the selection and asked there. a dialogue asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes will take place at every start of the program. it can also be turned under settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule and have created and realize that it should be one or be, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to which is sought after in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can set a Extended search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you wish to group options, you only need the cross box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. these options see as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited there to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in the full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly made it on & digitised; s specific implementation may be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow, the colours used by your camera or scanner come from the actually photographed and scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors click on your monitor to those of your camera or scanner, and that the colours you print or publish in the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the subject comes to color administration, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the outcomes he wants. unfortunately, the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color administration. additionally you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all the criteria listed below, then you don't have to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sGB-color-brows. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image spending are by email or the web where sRGB of de facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if the RGB works so well and life is so easy for everyone, why should one use another color-brow and have to make your thoughts about colour-administrations?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limb of sRGB compared to the colors we can truly see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufeisenular region, and the colors in the sRGB color, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensioned representation of sRGB with some larger farms, then visit Bruce Lindbloom excellente page and click on information About RGB Working Soaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to cold my monitor if I decided to work only in the sGB of color?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the RGB RGB work or not, you have to allocate your monitor. so the calculating of your monitor includes the circle. if you are working as compared to the RGB, you need to either use your monitor on the RGB standard, a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections available that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual work.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, capture, automatic, and contrast elevating the menu corrigier automatic correction try automatically to make the best of your colors. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method will scale the luminosity value through the entire image, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its color gradations. this function is often a magnet correction for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method used the lightening factor of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of the intention is as flat as possible. thus, the comparison has yielding very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces garbage. it is a very powerful operation which can either do wonders in an image or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic deactivation: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green- and blue-channel. they determine the dark and bright side-sounds and jushes the red, green- and blue-channels to complete histograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image by changing the lowest and highest values in the widest possible area and a new output of all values in between. this is only visible in washed up images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white cut off & checking out; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-off of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-like correction is slightly limited as over a color-bit with 8-bit per color. in case you can perform too far from the original image, areas with overexposure. in case you can carry the white downstream in the shell mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities will be better for correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white downgraffmus which is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. they launch him about the menu-entry colors white off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window display can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side are both the original image and the preview of the target picture. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original box right again, it is enough to click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target picture features a red marker. the Luminator of the pixels under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right above is a histogram displayed as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful there, even in well lighted images, most pixels very small Luminator values. with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminator.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, satiation and gamma. the shade will be able to improve the shadow details of your photos or be down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls to play around, you should use the color-temperature ppette. press this button and then somewhere on the thumbnail to use the color for the calculation of the color-temperature of the white-blaze. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white straight away with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indication is increasing the colors, when more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed. it will be shown the combined result in the white-button. this will be shown as a pure indicator and does not have an effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons are saving and charging exactly this. each setting of the white blaze you have set you can save it in a text file and then load again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets puts all the filter values back to its standard values and the neutral white-blaze. keep in mind that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you store this, your original image is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set here the codicaps per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding requires also more turntables, calculating time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as for the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profilings. colour settings can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can draw in the chapter color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors of sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to use several color channels at the same time, so that you can always make use of them for multiple images. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same correction. in the manual for the sound correction, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors of gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitised; tool Farouffings makes you four color effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantine filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar polarization, also called Sabatier, was an effect of a short flash by the additional light. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to finalize this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar polarization. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase in ultimately generates a negativity that so not to create photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original picture is the (1) and that works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it is different from a satiation that it makes a stronger contrasting effect that makes colors brilliant and smooth. try it simple, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a light-optimised colour movie made by the Japanese company Fujigr. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. however, the characteristics also make it a few photographs, especially those that are scared landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrast-edge. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neonlichts. with great pictures the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color contrast and the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu. all your adjusting can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the results you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a picture of bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a great choice for brightness / saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation will be able to increase. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple lamp-strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool of sound-correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue is very complicated for this tool, you need only the area of shale. concrete, the three sliding on below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intention, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graphs are three sliders into the inside and which can be moved to change the intention of the image. the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regulator and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, the original and the preview of the image can be considered. the preview is dynamically updated, based on the settings of the image. on the left are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram is presented with a linear or logarithmic axis. for pictures of a digital camera, linear histogram is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the arithmic histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic setting will be useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three Regulators: the top for the dark tones, the mean for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammaids.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color-pettes can be used in the preview of the original image to add the input of the shade, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is one button for full automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Extracts: the gaards allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two Regulators that can be used to change the executors as well as in the input. the compression of the gawatts can be used for example to create a hidden picture as a background while something else is to be seen as a background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: with these buttons, the default values are stored in the filesystem and later loaded. in addition, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three color chains, the input data is automatically used for all shadows, medium and sun-sounds. activate the color box you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for the enactment of the histograms for red, green-, blue and the Luminanzee channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indication indicator controls all the colour channels to view overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the procedures applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the exterminations are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original is displayed as well as the target picture. the thumbnails will be refreshed depending on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows the channel to specify the module that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of sensory mode. for pictures with large areas of constant color creates the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help further.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move on the right to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright sounds can be corresponded with darker exhausts and that the corresponding picture pixel will be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photograph is a red marker to see. if you want to change this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is jushed to your liking.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: using these buttons, you can do exactly this. any curve that you have created can be stored in filesystem and can be loaded later. file format for this is the Gimp cam format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want this method and the three color pipets buttons, you automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sunny. activate the color box you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red, green-, blue and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indication indicator controls all paint channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. here it is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white picture, which has been corrected in the Luminant canal. shadow and sunny sounds are placed with the colour pette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & digicame; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The canal-blender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">You can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the original area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed as a comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram appears to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you also activate Luminator, the image-blender then activate the tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix Monochrome, that does not appear at the same point in the color channel and whose smoking pattern is different in each channel differently. if that's the case you can improve your monochrogconversion in which you reduced the bullet first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The store as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can you save for later and then load. it used file format is the Gimp channel blender format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indication indicator controls all the colour channels to view overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been converted. the Luminator option is activated. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always intriguing about your abstraction. with the development of digital photographs, black / White is a step of work, as color images can simply be converted to the computer. also with a set of film rollers profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford DP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filters: simulates a black / white film exposure to a green linsenfilter. this looks good at all the scenery and fits very well to portraits against the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure to a orange lime filter. this improves landscape, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) oranfilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposing with a red linsenfilter. this creates horcelestial effect and can simulate moon-face to day-time. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellowing filter: simulates a black / white film exposure to a yellow lime filter. this is the most natural dye lens and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and middle tones while he adds a bit cold in the chimney. this is very similar to the process of the appearance of a pressure and re-development in a Sepiatschooner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and with it similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digitization; tool texture can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged score, or as a wall image on a wall. the menu effect image apply the image processing can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the semblance of the depth and tridimensionality of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text system has been applied in the photo below. the original picture is (1) and that changed under (2). the parameter relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digieder; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a spectator in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the eye view. under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you place the desired type of body for your image. consistently, the image with a coloured line, Niepce embraces it with a cute three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button-feathers and decorative stituting a zipper frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: returns the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is from 1% to 50% limited.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target frame will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture in any place. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. use text color, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-sighted background. already the picture is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button 'OK'. after the picture was saved, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">"" "when checking out the tool" "" "Connect" "" "tool, you can apply a template using one image." ""</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "the menu image" "" "Connect" "" "can be used in the image processing can be used to show stencils over an image." ""</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil, there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of file size of the template. if you want to add your template with maximum compression (9), just send an e-mail in English to the & digitised, mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to insert your template folder with the knob folder. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for the stencils, a tree-view, which reflects the folder structure of the Schablonenordner. selecting a folder is updated the thumbnails of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is magnified the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrine: this button reduced the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the full image, you must reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. do the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then automatically be adapted to the prescient size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitised; sets three different tools to acuteness. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but generates particularly in dark areas, grained images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Insharpened mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually it does not work a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric agents, and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it's copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the edge. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital pictures need a correction of sharpening. elements that are smaller than the resolution will therefore be combined into a common color together. that's the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more downstream than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG images it is often applied to a camera internal sharpening. images in the shell-format, however, must always be melted during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner uses a focal filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable them, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you may get usable results by calling a photo with the sharpening value. that allows you to call with the menu application corrigier sharpens.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should however deal with caution because the results are not very natural: the sharpening increases the sharpness of edges, but reinforced also the smoking. in general, the most suitable technology for sharpening an image can refocus on the tool. below refocus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to paint the picture a little soft, is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool for softness with the menu application corrigidly and experiment with something with settings. the window display on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and the preview can help edit the image. the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. default values produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius, or the amount reinforce the effect. if you create the unsharpened mask, smoke detectors and the impression of ridge in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of a channel through the filters. high-resolution images allow greater radios. they therefore should raise images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpened is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The Corpora value is a break from the maximum RGB value and to the applicable difference. one can thus define a minimum difference in order for an edge of filter. in this way areas with a soft change between the killing of sharpened and hence beauty errors in faces, Himmler and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blur masculine filter. the original picture is the (1) and the edited picture (2). blurred mascot was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a Corpora = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitisation; tool refocus is focused on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected open-filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to revert a picture to & quot; refocus quot; in which it is a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a sharpness mask. you can start it out of the menu by calling colours refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular flows works much better than the gauß's folding. the FIR's Faltung has a very long tail, which leads far from the source pixel, which is far from the original pixel, which is far influenced by the remote pixel. the causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular thread. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should result 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred then however on halves.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the diamond filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. if the detector is too low. if the smoke filter is too low. a usable value is 0.03. a high value is still further concealed.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauge's sharpness: this is the radius of gauge's sharpness. use this parameter if your insharpened gauge is. in most cases, you should let this value be 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value inequal to zero, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the smoker filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Note size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix code can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpened edge or the gauge's edge. please note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameter you have placed will thus be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cuts, color and Intensive cliques on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that lots of operations that are not immediately visible immediately, but later left unpleasartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compress; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally produces blurred masking produce better results as sharpens. this could be caused to blur the blur masking a larger neighborhood as sharpens.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, blurred masking must produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it is never able to remove the effect of unsharpened. for the Vienna Filters one can show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the unsharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when editing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was done with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpened correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regler smoothtte puts the insharpening of the area that was blacked in order to generate a natural sequel Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The coloring enables a customized paint for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove the desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The insertion algorithm has been developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available presets are included below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to use the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail-keeping p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothtte over the picture. woes against bigger values mainly homogeneous regions and details. a value of 0.9 should provide details so that no sharpenalties necessary is necessary. please note that the details of the details should always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Rip-dependent Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie baskets or CCD Raul will produce a high value waveable patterns. JPEG artefacts are best made with a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above all.p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effects it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetition: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-wide since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is chosen, there should also be small chosen. make sure that small angle to create a long term. thus, you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride (0,1, 10]: integral stride-wide in pixel. you should put the value of less 1 to avoid Sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: this selection of quality you can receive by selecting this option is only small. he doubles its term. we therefore recommend it to allow him to leave him.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons are saving as and charging exactly this. any adjustment of picture errors can be saved in a text file and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Graphical errors is comparatively very fast at work. however it can still last very long and have a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors to be corrected with small artifacts. the module is applied at a photo that was caused in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see there is an autonomous artifact that caused by a bad movie storage during the trip (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitization; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to cut images. it uses a copyrighted algorithm used by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter available to remove patches and other artefacts, for example from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mosis; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on sensorimitation of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will need only the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can be blurred. the area indicated by the radius, moves over the image and the color in it will be smoothes and hence minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the edge of the sharpening. this value sets the pixelable to determine the luminous changes. you may need to recount the edges, if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter images can no longer get preserved and noise or lubricate occurs.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the cantonal accuracy for the sharpened. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not be the entire noise away or smoking tips can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove an vigilant smoking or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminosity of the picture. we recommend you either color or lightness to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothment process of the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour-tolerant of the picture. we recommend to you either color or lightness to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatintolerance of the picture. this value can be used to raise the tolerances of the darker ranges, which are typically stronger, but also the shadow areas too.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the alignment of the phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering can occur when it is too high, can cause noise and phasenjitter at edges. it can remove noise and phasenjitter at edges. it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking rates can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrective with (2) marked with standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to paint the picture a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpens. use this tool for softness with the menu application corrigidly and experiment with the smoothing. the window display on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicame; photo Restauration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce Photoartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts of your images. it is very well adapted to gauge'istic noise, movie grander, compresses and local errors that arise in digital, original or subsequently digital pictures. thus, the smoothing takes place along the picture contours and thereby receives the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text composition. the text translation is performed with a different tool, the image error correction, performed. the algorithm for restoration was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Franconia and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss of discomfort & quot; artefacts; - small standards that are reflected in unzipped image. this attitude will correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons are saving as and charging exactly this. each setting of picture restoration can be saved in a text file and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still last very long and have a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with uniformidable noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous movie bastion on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures was reduced to an old color photograph that was used with a scanner. you can see the scan of scan that was caused by scannerlighting and the photo paper. the original picture is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicome; tool Hotpixel allows to remove Hotpixel of photos with a CCD camera, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEG Pixi project which are copyrighted by Martin Dickens.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are especially high-quality white-screen photos a problem, since many cameras have with JPEG compression to have a built-in print for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "this tool can be used to remove & quot; name is pixelquot; and" "" "bright pixelquot; and" "" "bright pixelquot; and" "" "bright pixelquot; and" "" "bright pixelquot; and" "" "luminous pixelquot;" "" "in a photo with an dark-image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the knob. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you can take the dark picture directly into the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defective.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel. please note that the wizard is the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and the preview can help you correct within the image to correct the result. the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are taken out in all advantages.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select then the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: it is identified an average of the neighbor pixel. the resulting color will be assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixelblock, are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default movie method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are pulled to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cuban curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction to a color foto, from a defeced digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, the original image was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitization; vignetting error is a tool in order to correct the Vignetting, i.e. subexposing corners, an image to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Further angle-lenses, particularly the middle and large photo format, can often illuminate the whole sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierquot; (shaded) they the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephones may show under circumstances also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has cons. many Center filters need one factor 1.5 or 2 in the blissor filter which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. far-angle lenses should, also use with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise unwind-effects emerge through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the big exposing areas of today's film and color-making use by digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by constructing an equivalents transformation in a structural filter that is applied without this filter. the tool Vignettierungscorrectly is applied with a Centerfilter. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the vignetting filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of lighting absorption at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with a blending setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, incrementally, reduce it to compensate a small degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and gamma-settings: the editing of an image with the VignettierungsSurgery reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you have to revert the exposure of the target image with these options. the regulator will only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a subtle new judicial to the exposure of the target picture, so let the values for the luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & checking; image editing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vignetting corrections applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminous and contradiction correction is also performed in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitization; Linking distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses to photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm used by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second Grades treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convexe form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar round-effect, flap but at edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient Grades corrected the distant corners opposite to that of the second Grades. if you combine these two can be virtually eliminated each geometrical distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second Grades. with negative values, tone-shaped distortions can be corrected, and positive values sockets.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of fourth counts. this value acts stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter has the reversed sign of the parameter fixed.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale the size and thus leads the correction first engraver. negative values grow while positive the image is smaller.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value jushes the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values next to the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tongs or hovershaped correction should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes. best, you perform this correction as all first. in case you cut a picture new and then carry a toned correction, the effect is obvious of falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to you, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it into an important place, such as the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. following the connection you can correct the tone / pad with the help of the lines correct.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a pad-shaped distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can transverse these with the cutting tool in the menu Transformations to remove from the image processing or through the zoom Regulators of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the tone-shaped correction is made. the next logical step for some motives like e.g. shots from the front, frame and paintings is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonsile correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate an infrared movie of the gimpguru movie. the filter produces the well known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared movie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity area of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Beneath the preview you can set two parameters grains and cinematability (ISO). activate the option insert movie granularity. the ISO Regler changes the amount of movie bastion and dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green fields are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter channels supplement to the reproducing of infrared film, especially the green channel, it makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos since the color formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared filters applied to a landscaping from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture under (2). higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the cutting edge.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitization; filter movies is a simple to use tool to reproduce movies on your images. this is from classic high-speed films like the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitiveness of the films, the manufacturers mix great silver-basins of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The movie body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to postpone the past back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular sight especially in your monochrome photos, so you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With regulator the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the baskets. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required, on ISO-2400. if you need even more Körner, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of cinematics effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the applied meaning (2). the most used film-sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitised: filter oil paintings produced the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitised: filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush-size between one and five out. thicker brushes are ideal for large pictures. smooth brush controls the smoothtte or, viewed from the other side, the magnificence.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with (1) and the original is marked with the (2) height for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothtte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & checking came; filter coherent uses color - and Intensity engraved to create a carbon copy. the lines which change the outlines in the drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you could have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top controller chooses the pin size and the lower jushed the contrast (smoothtte).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of coherence filters. the original picture (1) and the altered image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved even further through adaptation of the intention.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitisone; filter engraving forms your image in 3-D, as if it was stacked in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & checking came; filter gravity is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monary landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited picture (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filtering group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art. it uses protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave flashes 1, the image is distorted here in another version of glass blacks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filtering group, you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of insharpened effects. it uses protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom unsharpened: blurred the picture along sternfoous lines that emanates from a center. this simulates the impassfe to see a zoomous camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial insharpened: blurred the image by rotation of the pixels to a center. this simulates the insharpened of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Remove unsharpened: blurred the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion of movement: blurring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the imsharpened a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographed, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening insharpened: blurred the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or for adding a warm and subtle bulbs.</seg>
<seg id="620">Bulk solidity: blurred the picture by random shifting of the pixels and simulates the insharpening of an arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpened: find the color pool in the picture and wigs it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it, through filling with an average pixel.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="624">The rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image. this gives it natural your images a sweet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Trough size it allows to change the size of the trop. as the droplet size does not automatically decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish changes the optical effect of drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & check; image editing an area free of rain drops. use the range tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should stay free. if you start the filter controller, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rain drops filters. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or rotating into the proper orientation. the tools can be found in the transformer turning and transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blister is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to smaller is simple. the big question is, how can you get an image bubbles and the details are sharp? how can you find the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here, makes a good work here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transformative size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for the size is using a linear interpolation method to connect up the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitization: uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo overblow was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and are counted below:</seg>
<seg id="635">The aspect ratio is maintained: if this setting is enabled, when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effects it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons are used as and charging are used exactly for it. each insertion for photo can be stored as a text file, and later be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo blister is very fast with what it makes, but it can still last very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by adding a small color screen to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear default extension to the comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery, but also a commonly underestimated tool to cut a picture. in order to cut a photo, you just need to get a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and draw up the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle then you'll see the mouse while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you let the mouse sit down again the area of the photos is cut off. thus, you will get a good overview of how your photo would look after the cutting area. you can change the size of the triangle by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by clicking on the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting-section, use the button-cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file store or file save in the menu file to store the newly allocated photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the triangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in dialogue remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After page ratio, you can specify orientation as high-format or insert-format. in the high-format, the larger value of height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After page relationship use a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimeters, instances or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Down in the dialog you can set with the Max. ratio button to the area to cutting on the widest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After page relationship derives its settings depending on the orientation (Horizontal Directional or Vertical). if you use the random tool displays the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the modified images are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected in the original image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of composition aid enable help to put your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic ponds are based on the principle of similarity. as the third elreins, harmonic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Forest: the Golden Center is a split that refers to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy, or the Blüttenths of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things we experience as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The Golden division is the irrational number 1.618033988... and she was already used in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who thus used to build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects built the golden partition in all times when you put your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two progresses. the decomposed divider is followed as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The Golden Center provides liqueer auxiliary lines when you put an image. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third-thirds, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that leads the eye through the image along the spiral of the spiral, creating a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are the rectangle of the golden spiral, also called Golden rectangle. this rectangle is used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without getting the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also diverted from the above-discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the midpoints of the sides of the golden rectangle. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equivalent triangles. diagonale to place these lines can cause a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break up your frame, create a effect of professional photographs dynamic symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal directional to reflect and flip vertical can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary line. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens light that you don't have the camera accurately vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things came around an angle. you can repair this with the & digitised. image processing and the tool free rotation. choose Transformting Free Rotation and hit the waycorner.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button presets you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the spin is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module Free Rotation represents a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now please write the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is the function transformers recutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the auto-cutting function. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing withered the picture a bit after rotation. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivic transformations are performed by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you must use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right of the dialogue you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle on the top above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adapting the perspective, the image becomes a little wasted. for an individual adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you'll get unerring triangular holes in the corners. one way to install this is to cut the image with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The switching tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and shift the other part into the opposite. this is not a spin, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can launch this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scare your image by setting the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can press horizontal and vertically at the same time. if you press on presets, the angle will be reset at zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the finish are shown on the right side of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="680">Your help will be a vertical and a horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to add your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After having carried out the shearing, the image becomes a bit blurring. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two jackings generated twice as much blurring and hence, you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After switching the picture has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitised; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are computed. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries, it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digitised; displays only files in formats that know. this happens using the file expansion and a comparison of these with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list. you can change this list of the extensions & digitization. in the section configuration you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the used format. a detailed description of these formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digiarrived; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures for digital pictures. thereby, redundant information is reduced to this way the image data can be applied to a more efficient way.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localisation makes tools available for pictures geographically in the spherical coordinatsystem which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, latitude and latitudes are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx form. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the top to the visual dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a split file with GPX file. of course this file contains data from the same time at the same places as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When loaded the file is loaded an automatic correlation which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS Spurdata are recorded in GMT-time and therefore the camera will be reversed with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera eit. lies the deviation underneath, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have the proper information. if you know that in reality a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS is, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to the interpolate button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you've made a number of photos at the same place. as the dialog you notice the coordinates from a call to the next one, you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set on the map. select the relevant region and enlarge sie.Lead this over and over again, until you have reached an adequate accuracy. the amount must always be chosen manually. the map can be changed manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite screen and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang onto the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exact tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums from HTML pages conform to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is UTF-8 encoded to enable the best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tab in which the settings can be adjusted. you only need to select these albums only. with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below is the albenign and the text that appears in the head of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely explained. the option for each image is created a page in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the picture is displayed directly with your default screen, & eg; Kuickshow is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all of your associated images. select a folder on which you have typed cursor. a subfolder with the name KIPIcons, which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color-depth you can change the standard color-depth. naturally, the file size also influences the file size. all other settings are explicable.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider's thumbnails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for the thumbnails which are small images displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window showing the user how far the action is. press Cancel to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the programming issues to determine whether mistakes occurred during the generation. the web browser is automatically launched in the end to preview the preview of the gallery. press Connect to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image field is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image considers it to look at a selection of pictures and perform on them basic operations such as screenings, zoom or distortions. it has been developed with short-punch and mouse clicks. it has been developed for a quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, an image is displayed by default in full-screen mode. this can be changed into a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG loss module is a tool to change images without compromising quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save for the actions listed below, pictures in the JPEG format, without the usual losses on quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases, as no compression of the colour information takes place. this can be found e.g. at PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the import -function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image editor you want to copy in the main program, so the image to copy the file image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied after you hit the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work for all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please check out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodizer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a basic screen shot. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV from the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally you can create a background color for the slides. using this module it is possible to create formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the pictures to be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. then you can start using extras to MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you then are listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change sorting of images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. video format can be chosen from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you schedule the file on a television, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, Secon or NTSC. PAL is pre-adjusted and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed. a low value creates a very sudden, a high contrast very smooth picture-change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should leave them in black. the name and path of the created file you can specify on the name of the MPEG output file. keep it as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file using the name of the audio file, it will be integrated into the movie. after all the settings you have adapted to your preferences, you can go with the button Coding the creation of the movie. depending on the speed of your calculator you can get drinking coffee or enjoy a coffee while you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that Kodiers or tools is missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages on the button Settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The pressure assistant allows multiple images to print on one piece of paper together in standard photosizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is for example: useful to enhance you or to print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">This KIPI module can import and convert your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original feeling of Him is: expect you from dcraw not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera performers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and run the module. the Raw pictured window appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-use the values to optimize the convergence process. the first option decides whether to use the camera settings for the white. the essential parameters such as Gamma, brightness and Red / Blue amplifier can be jushed. if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera operates in the RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the file name remains the same and only the expansion will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the loss of free LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to use your pictures frequently or otherwise, you should not use the JPEG format as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacker batch mode allows you to convert different pictures at once. so use this mode, for example, by testing in a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the option to automatically overwrite file. this is helpful in case these have been created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to re-compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of a album. you can bet the prefix, the start-up and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can reduce the image or enlarge. for this purpose, four types of picture adaptations are made available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the picture is automatically selected, depending on the picture-orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): percentages in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportionate dimensions in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed by this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation preparation: preparing the image for photo pressure. the user can adjust the print solution and the size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, edge-size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the coming pictures beforehand. further pictures can be drawn to the list of images to be used and stored there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the pictures window will be shown with the pictures selected from you. you can add more pictures on the button with a file of choice. for the most recently painted image a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and place it to add the list of the images to you.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images, the selected images from the list are removed from the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the pictures you have OK to open the new message -window of your e-mail clients. you just need to add the addresses and the subject. the images selected will be attached to you as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't make sure to send a lot of pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of e-mails emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and everytime again until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a hung file, the comments are put together in a text file put together and the mail sweeps.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it's best adapted among the loss of free formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG on file format and are the original files in the JPEG format, then the original video data is added to the actual pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window is not automatically closed so you can see the status feedbacks, looking for faults, can be viewed automatically at the end. with the button Connect, you can switch this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau appears a window with questions like you want your Slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation are activated very elegant image outputs using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, as otherwise the deasha will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. you can then manually toss them with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures selected randomly select that the pictures are shown in a random order. so it is not used to order the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the pictures the temporal distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds meet 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance largely depends on your computer and your selected transition effect. so you should take it out before you show the presentation to your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transitions between which you can choose. randomly, choosing a different effect at every transition between images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Slideshow, you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn you off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slides.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom left side of the screen, you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module backpicture is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module focuses on the currently selected picture, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE's surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & kphotoalbum; through this browses, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, so in persons, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you entered information as you browse your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look to EXIF based information, watch the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails. in the following, each one is described for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible. through this selection method you can restrict the number of images of a few thousand pictures on a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can view with thumbnails to view the images of your impact.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same icon before their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum, but for each person his own thumbnails, this is of course also true for places, keywords and other categories that you yourself defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button which you want to use right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category. this has the advantage that you can see for example symbols with images of individuals and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must set yourself what image is to be displayed for each individual person. in order to view this, you will have to view the picture editor's window (in nearer window), and select the image menu according to your needs. in the Ansichts window you can customize the magnifying factor according to your needs and select which part of the image is to be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you call for an entry in the main window, you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the solid image characteristics. this dialog lets you look at the picture once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the labeling or description, the signments and descriptions of the pictures are searched for after this text. if you want, you can also enter a date, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a section of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options at the bottom of the window, you can browse all the pictures for certain name as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, however, not Anne Helene is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum.. if you do not like to read manuals, but prefer to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and look at the fast-entry, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & Lex album; and choose the demo in the first dialog, in case you start & coke album; for the first time, or select in the menu Help the menu entry of the games album; -demo. then, some examples will be loaded and you can test the functions of & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this handbook, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of the main window, see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name already says, this bar displays you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline displays you several different time units. each box shows then a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database, showing the box only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline allows you to interact in the following ways: you can preview the indicated entries preview from the database (when you select a date, the first picture of this date is displayed in the preview video) and also the timeline shows always the current date of the currently displayed pictures, when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select one area of the timeline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so the timeline will move. if you select one area, you will see in the preview view only images of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& # 3 album; will provide you with two options at your disposal HTML website with your images. one is integrated in & B's album. in the following part of the user manual is described in & 3 games album; integrated version described you can create via the HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML-pages you will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the moment and a description which is to contain the HTML file later. on cardboard album; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & # 3 album package; -export file should be created on the review page. nutritional information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed by the viewer also without description. remember that all pictures are exported from a party. you can currently use this setting in order to hide specific pictures from certain views.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, why not in this specific way.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this allows those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download the maximum resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your side can change the resolution at any time. so, it can easily change your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he does not want to display a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">You can best select a base folder for all your HTML files, and for each subsequent set you will find a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you will have to select the main folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and set in the next time. thus, you can select either a folder or a record by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if they're really all visible for viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, this folder should be. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you will not have to copy it manually. so that the import function, behold, correctly you must specify the final target of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are.</seg>
<seg id="930">The currently described settings are related to all three of the base folders and URLs. in this case, a subfolder is laid out, whose name you can define in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kegs album; come together, you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you already have a lot of time for it, the image information, persons on the pictures, receptions, etc.. enter, then you have to do with & kphotoalbum, this work does not even make.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import others into your database. the image characteristics are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a shortcut to images. the advantage of all images can have taken up and that file can be accessed as independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML-pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the pictures in two fold. first the corresponding pictures are not found, so the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is described in the dialog for exporting images, which you can export via the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialogue is whether it should be internal or external .kim files, the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you switch directing to the .kim file, you must copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatic option, copy the .kim file to copy & # 3, the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not required to compress the files. if you want this anyway, just choose the option export file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum picture size. if you want to send your friends pictures, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, since the .kin file would otherwise be very big. here you can say the size by saying that each image is 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you choose a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu File imports... select, will import & # 3 album; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to the importer consists of four steps. first you have to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category individuals to the imported file personer (if you are a swans), while this category is in your database persons. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog window, which categories are to be imported to the imported file and which categories will match them in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">The fourth step allows you to switch the categories to the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is displayed on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to browse and look at pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to look inside of different picture groups & mdash; if you want to see for example images of your Italy's holiday and discover a picture with your boyfriend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will pass the various steps of (1) fixing the information about your pictures, about (2) the look and look, through to (3) advanced themes and adaptpossibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program for the administrator of your pictures. it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this handbook, talk about images, but frequently it also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& # 3 album; saves all his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. it is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& # 3 album; remember the folder in which your images are saved and used it for future start-up. if you want to read a different folder with pictures, you can start a different folder tree with pictures, you can start & coke album; with the option -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">About the menu entry settings in the menu item, set up... you will get to a window by which you can change the settings of & # 3. in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can visit the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can call through a keypress on the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described as you can define each image different features, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals, or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog that is used to already existing groups. for each available group you can select a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In section subcategories have already been mentioned. in dialogue options you can set full members groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group at one time in one group instead of explaining all groups of a membership.</seg>
<seg id="956">To see the settings options available to you. with the listing selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window, there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his module system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin interface. nutritional information can be found on the home page of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be viewed via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this handbook as they are not part of & # 3. but most modules have an aid page, which you can call via the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared with each other with each other, it may be that the modules tested with & kphotoalbum. therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo-database before you call them via the command line with the command &gt; kegos album &gt; or through the menu Help. tell not, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, making it can be that some modules with & kegs album. do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between the games album, and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications are using their images in albums: this type of order does not support, simulates it for some modules the order to albums, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & coke album, the current album, that is simply the current view, so all pictures that show you the picture previewer at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album has to be released & coke album; the modules also handed over a list of albums. here & # 3 album, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & klos album; s browser displays the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album of the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in the setting dialog as a category for virtual albums, for example, if you're using the category people, so do & # 3 album; so do if you have chosen individuals and share this to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">As some modules with & kegos album; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog, and choose the module modules which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a boot screen as soon as you start & coke album; start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, take a look at the top one menu and a toolbar. in the toolbar you will not find much information about your pictures. in the section we will be able to see this window, now click on this window to show you an overview with all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum, is the ability to see each picture with notes. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, etc. you can put any image either individually or for a larger number of pictures given specific notes simultaneously. if for example on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see this notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you will see three lists with a text box by choosing people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum, as you can use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the shifting of images within the list: for example, if you have a family party and are shown on all 50 images of the same 5-10 persons, you can, therefore, that the used names are moved upwards to find people more quickly and assign.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to show an alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each picture individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and provided these pictures with notes. in this case simply click on the front and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it may be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiere entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. moreover, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window which indicates the US as an overgroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comments Diversity, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. additionally you can also draw an entry to a category and drop there to make this one subcategory of this item. attention, this implies that you just sort out your categories alphabetically. see this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the different elements of the Committee of Comments by clicking on the box, which form the waist of the frame, and move it. you can make your own window out of a frame by taking it out of the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have customized the look of the window to your needs that you are happy with the settings, click on the button options... that offers you the possibility to store the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame fully. if you want to see this window again later, use the button options... and then window a / hide. this will see you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">When you select the entry pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbimages of currently selected images, or all images in case you do not have a filter. for example, you can view the size of the thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure it just times.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you leave a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">When you click on one image, this is displayed in the image field. if you have not opened a window with an image viewing, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture previewer. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete, and select either the Delete key or select in the menu Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& # 3 album; for this problem you can use a solution. you can also use & kphotoalbum, namely pictures too, without saving on the hard disk. of course, you need to record the pictures somewhere, so that & # 3. in the picture you can see the view of & klos album; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails are present, so that the thumbnails will be displayed. however, you can preview these images with the image viewing.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires that you would like to copy files from the folders and then copy it. so, if you do not want to avoid browsing the specific CD, please buy a larger hard disk in order to save all images to it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a submenu with your name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, you want to unlock the pictures so that at the end those left you want to see for others and click on Current View privacy. alternatively, you can also select all the pictures that may see your little sister, contaxed and select the menu item all out of current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This way, you set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you want to block the laptop with your little sister, you simply select the menu-entry pictures, eliminating all the pictures you have blocked. if you want to see the pictures again, click on Sperre.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be typed to unlock the pictures. to set up this password, simply change password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Remember that this image protection is by no means very secure. for a one you can access all the images on the hard disk and on the other anyone who can instantly read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are working with & coke album; not very familiar to repel the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you can spend all your pictures with & kx album; manage and spend hours on hours of course you want to describe it. for this reason you have to look at some point. for this reason you have a picture _ and Videoviewing album. you can preview this from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer is able to see you in. it shows of course the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag them with the mouse and discard it elsewhere. you can also configure the information and whether information is displayed on the viewer. all these options are available after a right-click menu.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see the matching entries on this page. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser displays you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you were missing persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons high and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as Diaschau. & # 3 album, then introduces a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl button and plus or minus. it will be stopped by the Ctrl by buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the beholder of & kphotoalbum; it is able to change in the full-screen mode. in this mode, the spectator uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input key to change in the full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the spectator you can get into the picture and finish zooming. to Hereinzoom you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button you can reverse ralline The Plus key zoomt in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the simultaneity, sets the zooms so that each pixel corresponds to the screen to a pixels of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work at videos function that they are in and out zooming with the Plus- and your main key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the screenshots from the context menu, you can shoot the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you'll have a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. in the moment you can view the view and insert configurations of the image in order to print this name. however, you will perhaps prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you look at one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer provides the opportunity to look at pictures with features while watching them. features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature that you press the corresponding letter. in view you see a picture, where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have inherited features on your images, they are available to you in the browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have chosen, so you can just use all of them with notes. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you can view categories in Dre preview, then you can add features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the feature after the image was selected.</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you will be allowed to paint & # 3, on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not stored with the image but in the database. in the way you can revert your painted back later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to view a picture on the painted menu. to switch the painting mode of & # 3, select the picture from the context menu. to finish the Malen, simply put the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler, you need to master the application of the program & Povray; not completely control, but the documentation for & Povray; should you absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are shown in the properties tab and the object is shown in the wire modular views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously, but not the subobject of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">There are multiple possible positions, the following folding menu appears, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar, or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can then remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have modified features, click to apply to apply these changes. if you typed the values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and then click on the changes with aborting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already includes the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the Featurts view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the Featurts view and a small example of the scene is looted by the chosen texture, even if you wish to have a subordinated item (for example, a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), crisp you locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the checkpoints of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button, thereby changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the centre for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level. you can indicate this value relative to the Visibility level of the superior object or as an absolute value. objects are only then displayed when they are selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal in the toolbar chosen level of visibility.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window of window as default. the object tree and the view of the properties tab are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order, or if you need another order, you can adjust them as you like. you can also save several window frames and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under a present view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is anchored on the right or left side of that view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to assign multiple views to each other, drag the Anfasser in the middle of another view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the carton top in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window of window are floating views: views which are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from the anchoring, drag the anus to the desktop or click on the small to the left of the arrow in the anus.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To conclude a view, click on the small cross in the anus. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view you will find entries for any type of view. new views are sloping, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can renders them. & kpovmodeler; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be properly installed. as this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renders the current scene, click on the icon rendering of the icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the size and quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in various image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>

<seg id="1040">In the cartel card size you can enter the width and height of the stream image. if you want to rename only one small area of the picture, select the section section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality you can choose the characteristics that uses & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser Reflections. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user manual for & Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is loaded with only one ray each pixel, there can be different mistakes. these images often have a Moirè patterns or molt effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details will not appear if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally you see pictures with this property better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; recursively because every pixel is constantly divided up and adaptive because each pixel depends on the calculated color range.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray records a ray each pixel. if the difference between colouring to the nearby pixels, then both pixels will be calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the lowering of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling, a lattice of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a low level of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue from the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue from the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predetermined threshold, then the pixels will be shared in 4 sub-pixel, which can be pursued individually and checked on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the repository value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generating of smoking for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, changing & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderer is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflexion calculated. it takes very long to allow a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">This card card allows you to adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. one pixel is then transparent if the associated rays are not made object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; capacitors. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray scene, select the menu entry file import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler: not the complete command-catching of & Povray; if when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; write this code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can export objects from the object tree in the editor to export the code text for & Povray; this adds to the source code of the object in the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and inserting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene rename. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the Featurts view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation. make the path to your documentation and the version. supports the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can set the object-catches of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire-menu view. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scalizations and screenings.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values display a more accurate wire model, and therefore a better fitting for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detail-level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail fidelity for advanced projections, all the wiring model is used further, if the camera is using an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property results in a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall behind the objects is loosened. the wall is represented in a shaft pattern of two single-adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross ground, a ground below the objects is loosened. the floor is shown in a shaft pattern of two single-adjustable colors.</seg>

<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window frames or create new window orders. in the window panel, it is explained how to create and store window frames.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window window: displays all existing window frames. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window frames shows all existing window orders. you can create a new arrangement with the button Add and delete a selected order with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window of window is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order. new views can be added with the button Add and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with which, anchor your window under the existing window, with cardboard card, you will receive a card-card view along with the previous view and frosted entrust the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; and now you want to start with more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate however simple scene, among beginners like very popular: a bullet at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should note the following warnings, before you complain that you as a result only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set any camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert a light of light, your whole scene is in the dark, and you only receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything faultless, you will see the first start of & kpovmodeler: the following assigned window:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and available symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice it in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view properties tab, in which the various parameters of the camera do. in the user's documentation on & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Not change the basic settings of the camera, this is later subject to instructions, but note that the camera is in view control points, with which you can change the waypoint of the camera. simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the button or press the input button, the wire model opinions and the object tree will immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could for example insert a quader (inserting end body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumulative method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler: actually provides an easier way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the button, or clicking the input button. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view shows now also the plane, even if at the moment only as a limited end level. if you renders the scene, the plane moves up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + before the object. in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the properties tab.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise an unit under the horizon line, just allow you to get acquainted with some of these parameters. select shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust his material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialogue will open in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. please select the property object. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree (name = soil-pigment), with a click on the button preview, see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments shows only a matured black material because you can't need to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember to preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview. you now give the colors for the pigment. also, there are many possibilities, but take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you see no color on quader and ball in the preview, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now correct. if you rename your image now with a click on the icon you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you need to enter two new attributes, called monochrome. then edit this entry twice (you can also edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chess board colour list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the properties tab:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to perform, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler. the ball is just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the properties tab you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input button or the button to press), so that the ball has hovering over the ground, since you have moved the ground to move a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now yields a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears like a matured black material. set the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign yourself a material now. as already in the ground, enter the ball a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select bottom property and change the name for example in the ball pigment. click on the ball pigment, select then monochre and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on them or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings sheen effect and reflection already result in partially good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces even if metallic yet is not selected at all:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler. hopefully you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracts a scene, the renderer is hypothetical blasting from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera that crosses the scenes) through each pixel in the scene and how the visual effects of light springs in the scene and how to affect atmospheric effects such as fog. thus, the scene pixels for pixels is dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source you can also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, any scene that is to be inserted, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file expansion * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Sets the scene again in the last stored version. all changes since the last storage have been rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry you can only select if you have not yet stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeated the last reversed command. this menu entry you can only select if you have used editing them.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for hiring & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the shortcut shortcut. you can change or add new commands by this option for & kpovmodeler; commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens and remove a dialog to set up the toolbox. you can add and remove tooling for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to surface roughy surfaces without needing to model every bump on the surface and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a bump map and for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base, by applying a picture file as a color map.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewing and browser. the application has a file browser where you can choose images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBn; or the return button.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if each picture is to be displayed in a separate window, or if all images are to be used in the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the file in the bottom window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if an appropriate date is found, the file is highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing by return or & Esc;</seg>
<seg id="1134">In dialogue - & kuickshow; there are five card cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; set in the two others, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, you can set the shortcut for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images are opened in full-screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display is filled with the background color that you can set further down. default is not a full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is activated, invites & kuickshow; already the next picture in the folder, while you still have the current picture. this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option stores & kuickshow; at the end the name of the last opened folder. at the next start it opens & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the coloured beam to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full-screen mode. if in window mode the window is bigger than the image, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can show & kuickshow; so that only some of the types of file types can be displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option for large images the display window will be enlarged on the full screen. this option is switched as default.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may possibly set existing multimedia buttons so they can work as & Amarok. thus, make your keyboard on & Amarook.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP-interface of Amarook has many general functions, which are mostly also available in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the DCOP functions from collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts. an example call for the DCOP feature could pause & eg; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarook supports the commands-line options of Qt and & kde. in addition, Amarook has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed due to missing dependence. please check whether all the required modules are available and use a dialog, so the user ID, why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Rescue LoadError error =' Korundum (KDE Bindings for Ruby) from kdebindings v3.is required for this script. '' dialog --sorry '# {error}' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts, or simply expand the required features. you will soon realize that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the aid of DCOP can exchange your scripts with Amarook and Amarook. the simplest way is the use of the command dcop, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow external programs and commands. this means that the function can usually be called exec (). in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarook; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this reason, scripts should be monitored regularly and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script should also ignore events when there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to display the furniture dialog. to save the store and loading of the setup data each script must take care of each script. if a script is started, Amarante sets the work folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script could now & eg; with DCOP to more information on the new piece (for example the metadata or the denomination).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signaled a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customary Clicked: submenu clippers that can be clicked to identify the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom-defined menu item can be identified. to remove an entry again one can use dcop Amaroscript removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; it ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amaro. the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. storage of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks Script-Administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can also be optional with bzip2 (.bz2). such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which allows the user to clearly see the archive as Amarook script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarook; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Advanced. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining to ladle modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file right:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is finished, you can load it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the wiki script page of & Amarook. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; script.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarook takes only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have Kdelibs therefore installed (including the programs included in it, for example, modules or scripts). we have written a small guide, how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presupposes that your window manager will operate the relevant standards of freedescop.org. Gnome will work for example difficulties. we try to support Amarook on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt as they are set up an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Most likely, one of your files will make a mistake in the taglib library. you can view the file by clicking on ~ / .kde / share / Payok / collection _ scan.log file. please report these errors to the TagLib developer under bugs.kde.org and also hang out the caputte file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and let the collection again create.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly it is that Taglib crashes when reading the Meta-info file from this file. please report these errors to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, check SQLite. the support for this in & Amarook; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of these libraries are compiled with the same compiler version. if Z. B. & Amarofold; with GCC 3.4, taglib but with GCC 3.3.x compiled, then this leads to overthrow the meta-information.</seg>

<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; to use functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, so it is rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial that the accompanying programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP. to use these functions, you must first make sure that & K3b; then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have in common all & kde; -program in common, supports & K3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>

<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; a read for & kde.. with it you can easily save audio CD; s out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the Encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the surface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many codes (loss of free compression) standard (compressed free compression) by default (This code binary packages will still be installed from the Linux distribution). further Kodiers can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD is read; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed to the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats such as the lossfree FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & audiocreator; cdparanoia. nearly every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step you must be installed (for MP3), oggvored (for OGG) or other Kodiers. all these programs are usually not necessary to compile any self-distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something of yourself. however, only the code packages are not used, the installation does not need to be used, the installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code / file format is to be used? the chapters Space Kodiers gives a small introduction to Kodizer, audio quality and compression.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy of protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & audiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to avoid any copying protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device fails to deal not the mechanisms of copiers. simply avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only one needs to be done (the setup dialog can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration), following the daily handling of a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understanding the slim approach of the user interface, which you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>

<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog for the type of alerts (such as protocols, piepts) for programming events (such as read the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main introductory dialog of & audiocreator; with different carton cards (like encoder, to address the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, co-compilers and compression rates and helps you to choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is supposed to be lost, a loss of free audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and barely available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information from data compressed to their psychoacoustic model are MP3 and OGG the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important as both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is still delivered with most distributions free of charge, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or machine based music system and / or when one of the few existing OGG tools is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car-stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and the compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">"--preset Medium" = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. well enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and Autostereosks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freeDB program, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be transmitted / used with & kaudiocreator; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with cooperations, there is often a combination of programs for the code and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coworkers explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, adding the & CD; titles to keyword (English: day) if MP3s are coded using lame, the switches must be added from lame and the title parameters of & audiocreator; the result looks as follows: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CDs instead of entering into the machine. it is to note that here is only spoken by text: & CD; titles, artists, names of the pieces and etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (starting point) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; any more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be done. all information can be preserved from a bumblebee by a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; it is actively playing a cross box. for the use of freeDB can be used with another (fake) address than that in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for the use of freeDB, the geographical server is needed. this saves bandwidth network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of reflection on & CD; information while reading a & CD. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which elite programme is used to save pieces from the & CD; save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that there are cdparanoia; who wants to know more accurately, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package needs to be installed first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the busy WAV files, the code and therefore the desired file format are selected. at the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss of free compressing for audio data) on the tab for setting up the Kodierers. other Kodiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodizer package needs to be installed from the particular Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined code. further information on Kodiers are located in the chapters of Space Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolenwindow (eg; Console). it must be replaced by the name of the code installed.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the equipment's name & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and reader real it and whether both cdparanoia and audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, all understood, are but still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step by step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas which make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, and read all our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme 'to use MP3s with an VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be listed as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can do of course.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have screams to it (eg, trying to copy something into it with the conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & audiaudiocreator; something which presumably is done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the use of code for the compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we share the program with the freeDB program to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings anytime, we will most likely not be reading a & CD at any time, if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The Device-drawing is handed over to the read-program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real Device drawing of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive available, you can also get a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the equipment for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card holder of General settings. here you do not need much to do. here, an additional conversion will be defined. in our example everything will be printed as inserted in the screenshot as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only with incomplete information can be selected, so that you will be informed when information on the testimony of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card holder CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the & CD; data automatically downloaded over the Internet from a freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be during the reading of the & CD; connected to the Internet so he can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, becomes a & CD; entry be found immediately when you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the file name / file names or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory name or file name will be modified with Conqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; day.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example is further to note: if you do not want to manually enter the listing areas and freeDB is not used. you can use freeDB locally in offset mode, so the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following box card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us of freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server via the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section about freeDB. put it all the way it is shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page freedb.org and look after a reflection server in your vicinity. on this road, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as first try.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equitable as to the server, since many firewalls drilled the protocol 880 standard, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to submit a & CD; data to the freeDB server. the first iteration point should be clear.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously read pieces: apology, there is a reason why more than one at the same time only an existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author doesn't know it, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, you tick this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you want this to cross it, then the file / folder can be stored in which the WAV files will be stored. if the box doesn't be crossed, the files will be stored in the private folder. don't forget that folder if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All as inserted as it is on the screen shot. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances must be fed something to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hifi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' day for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously on encoding WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to codify more than one WAV file.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic establishment of & audiaudiocreator; this configuration is used as default for every reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section described how the process of reading the & CD is described. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is set on the hard disk, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will be described, must be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">As we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freeDB, see the screen photos a little different from the data for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of taking them from the Internet. comments will point out the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done, now the & CD must now be defined in the drive, which has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length in the window should be listed in the window as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and from cdparanoia can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD was completed successfully by the freeDB, all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key to your & CD; there will be a window appears, and you can select the database entry, which you think best suits your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the cross box for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but you need the data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be inspired in the input field 'current title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidiversions for each piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freeDB the CD editor is not empty, but it has always been a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor, so that you may not only begin with the artist and album name (e. g. if all words with large letters are beginning or not...) but also to check if there are any undesirable remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the commentaries, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentaries. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unrestricted field length, at least to what & audiocreator; maximum. this option is set up on the tab holder's settings; take a look at the section "base settings."</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information about the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all Kodiers or file formats. see the Help for the Kodiers to find more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, which is evident with the style of the read CD; matches. in this example, this is not important as we do not submit the & CD; data anyway. for further information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example can be found under skirt.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece, definitely and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB database. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown on the list list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or begged the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the button selection of the read process, so this window appears to be confirmed. OK, then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab for switching on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is read straight to the hard disk. the status of the program will be displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you see if you are trying to work with a code of code that you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully coded using a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp-file and the target folder are not what we have entered in the example. have you checked whether you have writing to the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the bug occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The mission 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and code parallel. notice the status message in the bottom of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing is configurable, the number of parallel processes is unclear. the calculator used with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with current accounts and code (of but two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded, and a third order is coded in the queue of the code. after the last piece is coded, a small window will appear with a message for a short while in the upper left part of the window appears.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audiocreator; you need & kde; 3.x and 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is addressed to individuals who compile source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs if it once runs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different programs, has many variants of settings. the best read the step by step to get to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of different cardboard cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that may not be used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still on reading? even if only the help menu was clicked, after the first start of the program, without any clue as it should go on, from this somehow empty screen (especially when there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is all about? who reads this has probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can't maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; may it do. at least just after contacting the author. and if you read this, he has belated this section and therefore agree with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you succeeded in taking the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need this information but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke gamers of & kde.. besides others he has with real-time graphic and karaoke-real-style adjustment of texts also some features, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, thus, should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; supports the & Linux; ultrasound project driver, which is needed for CIS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a Sequenzer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of any MIDI-channel activity by highlighting the buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag in & kde, any MIDI file from one & Conqueror; window to cap.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events). KMid will automatically identify the procedure used in each case.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. when you finish & kde; during the playback of a song, KMid starts again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI-Synthesizer, Awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter, you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also let a file from one & Conqueror; window into the & kmid; window to drop. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and begggle the button folding in the toolbar, select the entry to play out of the menu or begged the space button.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the & kmid; -window. (on several pieces they will be added to a collection and then replayed each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a play takes place, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow down, you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempography and so change the playback speed. to get back the original speed, double click on the Tempoon LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The whitespace has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the blank is like a pressure on the knob, or selecting the menu or pause in the menu item, thus interrupting the playback, while no piece is played, starts & comid; playing.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text events, others use lyrics and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be presented and even better: the herignant type is automatically determined to set a song so you don't need to manually set the karaoke text. you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a heralignant type, select from the menu settings the items text events and lyrics. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you combine. these are played in line. in this section is how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To insert a collection, first open the collectors manager. you will find this in the menu collection under the item Organize.... click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired in the collectors manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">To the temporary collection all songs that you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not saved. worry about when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in collecting managers. there, you can add a song using the button Add Folder. it appears in turn the file dialog, with whose help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic execution is enabled to collect, a piece is automatically added to the opening (using file opening or Drag & Drop) automatically to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and ert. this collection will then be added to the continued pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open up the collectors manager to select the collection and the desired song and then click on Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select The row after the submenu paragraph of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you can add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in collecting manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song back, select the previous piece, the entry previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the Collector manager, select the collection and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted. however, this doesn't matter because it is not saved when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer who are not general-MIDI. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events translated into events that synthesizers the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type change patch to Bright Piano in the type Change patch to Trumpet type change, and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need any MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favourite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file, which stores all necessary settings for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Every section may appear only once, except KEYMAP section that may appear as often as desired. prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "A further keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">They see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END, that the end of a paragraph is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section is specified like the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard. general usage is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note, that the left side of the Equal sign is ignored. it is thought that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments wears.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional all keysTo M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard, for example, do not take a gun (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which gives you the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun signal), it takes patch 100 (the drums on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here, with the term Tumel patch the patch is meant, at which every sound represents a different percussionment (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the tone is the tonal of the ever same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how tones on a particular channel or instrument are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you just need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to make notes on the perklimmer channel. check out the included keymaps for example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and the second channel, you can easily do it in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion to a particular channel (general MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N'n it is the channel which is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will obviously continue to be defined in the file. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored that try to change the patch on this canal. in this case, the patch gets used later.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the perkeling patch on the perklimb channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio indicates, in which ratio Pitch benchmark events will be multiplied with the value n, this is calculated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file no decimal number are available).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard that gets a pitch using the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play two sounds up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole row claviatures (one for each MIDI canal). on these picks you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the sealview to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument, the button no longer green but red to show that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canalview has (until now) two different views to view the played notes. you can select the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binder (rpm, deb) of & kmid; having done this because & kmid; without Awe support, you have to download a source: download and install (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree that supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. just open the folder you want to add in & Conqueror; select all the files, and drag them onto the & kmid; -Window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before necessarily activate the setting of automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can switch the arrow-button on the left of the Tempo- LCD-LCD to slow the back. to restore the default tempo, click on the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have been on a & kde; -work surface a & Conqueror; -Windows with my MIDI file and & kmid; in this way I have to play a miaoke file) or added. in this way, I have to play a miaoke file or I want to play a file, only in the & Conqueror; window change and drag the desired file to the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file just quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn the setting of automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.D. first, you just want to play the first file. so make the adjustment of automatic addition to the collection and opening A.D. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play at B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animates me, continues to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; Laga (Spain). I think Mathematics at the University of Maacute; I try to take a little time for my hobbies, but I try to collect a bit of time. as Hobbies I have programming, MIDI files, music and proofs.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you would like to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; have, or even if you simply want to make me happy, write me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrapad @ arrapad @ arraho.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You truly make a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact you by friends of & kmid; if you want to send a MIDI file, however, you should contact me because I might have the file already.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends largely on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an Awe card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have sound card, you have to compile & kmid; compile the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the playlist. either, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connection below the bookmarking menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which are to be played according to each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchical view. if you have a entry, his group and all his sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked record.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuring files. of course, you can only do when & kmplayer; not running through the application itself. simply click on a name of a category Cclick on it from the View menu and as next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to be selected from the menu of the same with playlist, and either the processing mode selected, or another category will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processing mode will leave or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and ending can be deactivated by the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change by [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted simply.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; share the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / introsp.xml and ~ / .kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at Starts does not need to be short, it will automatically end by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end of the animation, so the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be displaying an favourite photos: & lt; smiles; & lt; & lt; & lt; / smiles; & lt; / smiles; in the source package of & kmplayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that will be supported by & kmplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for the configuration of Mplayers in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here the path can be set from the MPlayer and the intermediate storage size of the datacroms from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayability. here is an example like a "flash" with the swapping / swoop mozilla.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"Flash" can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be added to the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order that the & kmplayer; 'flash' can reproduce in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the MIME-type M / x-Shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file classifications of KDE are given.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; is to search in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if there is no mistakes here, the backend issue inside & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu) is to be examined.</seg>
<seg id="1726">With that a blueprint for a certain MIME type is taken (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done through manual changes in the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc. for example, phono is to reproduce all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV cards either using MPlayer or XVideo (this will need kxvplayer). before TV can be looked at, the scanner device can be used and the TV channels can be used manually or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (video data Recorder) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog is used in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo Port to use. there should be ports to be found out of which one is selected. the correct coding must be found (e.g., PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR can benefit from kmplayer only XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback from video devices to Linux). this is also necessary only on the first screen (: 0.0). this is why the videoforlinux will need to be functional for the X server. for the XFree86 servers, this is required to contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>

<seg id="1753">The fast-entry assistant of & kile; is an industrial feature for the quick creation of a document in & kile;. selecting the assistants (MenÃ ¼) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Documentaries: this is how the type of this document will be noted: article (article), book [report], report [report], report [readbook], book (DIN) [readbook], projector [Prosper] or custom.</seg>

<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; latex the subdivision of the document into the following items (part is the most common element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure, the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse click on the respective.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful in creating your own & latex; once a DVI; D e V ice I nów File)] created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; spectator to the corresponding line in & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the format document, and also other information such as font and is besides PDF the above output type of & tex; or latex;. there are many tools to view, conversion and printing of DVI; files for different systems and uprights.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the item description, the elements of the DVI; file chopped with the editor and once upon an item in the DVI; -file has been embroidered, becomes the exact opposite of it. once upon a paragraph in & latex; source code has been chewed, becomes the corresponding position in the DVI; spectator.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document the work is simplified with other integrated .tex files. when using a project a project-wide Master document can be adjusted to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick conversion: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed (if no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File watchful: in this mode the DVI; file on the basis of ndersungenâ, this is no call for & eyeple; after the fast-building.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When considering the edit toolbar, the three types of selection fields are stripped. the selection fields have been designed for quick insertion of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The prescribed & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field further is for example of articles such as tags, fusions, notes, or references.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section is created, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: is used for reference to a specified term (selection from a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When selecting a quote, a selection list with literary events is displayed. for example the editing of & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib.. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ ffe is used for setting the font, for the main text, the fox, notes etc. are defined. the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices for preparation: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings. 2. the document can be written by reason in hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the command\\ ins class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] defines the font. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also occur in the text too.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been typed in the & latex; code text will be compiled. the simplest way to this is the use of the building or the button fast.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compile. & kile; for storage is automatically saved.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, should be sought in the logging according to errors. if used by speedphysique & eyepie. this is not the case, should also be considered the logging.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English. environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font. the\\\ '{environment},\\ HUGE and\\ end {environment} is deemed to allow the type of writing in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are merely within the vicinity (from\\ '{environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no description (number) for the change within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for treating the readability and usability of the document. it can include certain fonts, fat printing, curative pressure, submissions, etc., these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the course of course and is long until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a phrase can be presented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Price: creates a quotation in the document. the quote begins with\\ '{rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex; recording address, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once an assistant has been typed a little text, a few adjustments should be accomplished for the better readability of the document. they should be mindful. a quote, a few places in the fat and curiosity and a poem to the application come to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, can be returned to the editor via Editor's view or Ctrl (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply test and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a dedicated file format (engl. D e V ice I nants). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi Edition like printer, & PostScript; / PDF transformers or computer imaging.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file is the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can be printed by file print (in the viewer) (provided that the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; -source code was created, the conversion will begin to begin using the button in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">Looking for a direct leap from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offering a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binaries. for this, only Modern under settings may furnish Kile... tools build up.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To carry out the pros, the mouse must be positioned in a line of source textes and fell asleep to presumptions. the go to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewers will then take place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document called the corresponding & latex; document of & kile; available and kicked; in & eyepiece; as text editor will set (settings eyeple set up... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If an error message of the & DVI; spectator does not exist, an error can occur. should an error exist, this is indicated in the log file or in the message window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file explainted the fault of error in the source code. in the editor you can always see the line errors in which the error seems to be. to consider the faulty line, the error must be chewed in the log file and & kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the corresponding button in the toolbar is clicked, a window appears to choose from the template for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1799">In selecting a document, a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard for the quick creation of a new document. further information can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Sophisticated users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates are available in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file format or a new file will be created. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting a document template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using file, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings Kile... settings should be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering a document class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ "class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$]</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps was accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can create your own template instead of default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be made from any & latex; files created. is a simple way for creating a template, should be searched for an Internet and the steps described below are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the beauty of reading and heron of many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). lots of settings for bed & Kate; can be made in the menu tools directly from & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more from Kate; and his mother's abilities should be attracted the manual to Kate. users of & kile; can there directly with reading the chapter works with the Editor of & Kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex; -command reference, which can be invoked by the help of LaTeX reference. it features a available description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with added Strg button to hide the & tex; -word to hide. that means that in this way by clicking\\ by\\\\\\\\\\ by\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the dragging of the text with penetrated linker mouse button, the text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow buttons with penetrated Shift key, you can find parts of the source texts in the editing pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the ability to browse all kinds of source texts and to highlight them. for example, the latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants have a lot of bookmarks available. in this case, it is an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu marks the jump to the next or final springon. this is also highlighted this springmark, so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a pointer.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & kile;. although & Kate; already excellent possibilities for writing a & latex; source textes are added in & kile; special commands included. & latex; special commands given to their selection. under editing terms, the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Do a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line). with a paragraph, this extended meaning are not included in the text, latex; -commands and all other lines of source texts. the only preventive thing in & kile; is with it that the expiry date separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Note the word under the current Cursorposition. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also latex; -commands with a round star (\\) and an extra star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To the part of a part of the document can of course be removed and removed by taking the button Entf. & Kate; provides the keynote rzel Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; provides with its own commands, for a faster result. under machinations are the following commands to contain the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removed a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to machining paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been noted that environments will play a central role in & latex; for this reason, & kile; for NF-other instructions in machining for a simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command is jumped into the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the desired setting.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command to end up the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to end the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the commands\\ '{environment} is located to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the input of many fraudulent ambient commands, quickly the desired view can be lost. this command is allotted the most recently paved area, so that the tachidered environmental structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for latex; -groups, which are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from machining environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command is jumped into the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the desired clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command to end up the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the slipping clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the welded clamp of a & tex; -group # is located to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many fraudulent groups-brackets can be lost quickly the Ã ¶ ffening group. this command all slept in the last group, so the disappeared structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; are used two simple anaeration characters. for the purpose of purpose is used in & kile; the sign "for two simple anavailable characters is used. also for example, the sign" used. & kile; knows this case and for two slept on the other for latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic inline of double the double belt mark can set up under settings Kile... LaTeX and will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use types of specific settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and therefore German or fransican mark. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">During the wiring of Shift; entrance-button, & kile; an intelligent pointer is placed. if the current position within a lists of environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize) is available & kile; not only a pointer, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Inside a tables surrounding area surrounding & kile; the current line with\\\\ with a graceful row break down.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to pre-set & latex; - or custom environments to support. these can be added under settings: set up LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users masked the columns in tables environments and thereby all Et signs (amp;) to each other. & kile; tries to educate this. while this tulator is not the nearby Tabulator, for example & kile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tabator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already a good source text system offers, this was added in & kile; for special commands (mostly for example & latex;) yet. it can be installed for NF-different modes. all these modes can be set for different working methods under settings kicks...</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment by using the command\\ begin {Surrounding} becomes & kile; automatically add the\\\ end {environment} following an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">The last character of the entry is removed, the last letter is removed and allows the complete list of results. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, descriptions are removed from & kile; also springders has been frozen, so that a simple jump to these positions can be viewed via Editors' next springray and can be viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under settings tile; furnish... kile; wiring settings can be made to these lists. it can be possible different wine list for & tex; - und & latex; -commands as well as windows of general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is for the actuation of environments not wet. it has always used a few letters with\\ 'and the call of completion. on the other hand, the environments are often used so often that & kile; a special mode for realising the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the actuator mode, or the button-button Alt + Shift key, the command to the environment of the environment is automatically checked and it appears\\ '{. afterwards, ambient temperature can be carried out in the easiest way and can be terminated by the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is accomplished, the environment is automatically closed again. once & kile; recognize that it is a list environment, it is even used to include a first\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings tile; set... kile; wiring settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the usual list of actuator mode for tex; - and latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; supported user-defined lists of aboutings, which are immediately set up by longer strings... Kile Versions can be set up. as an example of a purchase list, the file example.cwl, in which example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L entered and the word full-filled mode, the screen coating, or the keychain of Ctrl + Alt blank cables, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX character.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files, but offer excellent basis for modifications and re-orders of pages. will the PDF output can be displayed, so you can regenerate the pages with a few & PostScript; tools and then be converted into a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To examine the outcome of the work, the source code has to be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in the quantity to create compiling, creating converting and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiling of the source code for viewer, such as & eyepiece; or the further transformation may be the keychain; 3; 3, the DVI; file is converted to a PS file and be seen through Old; 5 the PS file can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the instruction installation, there is usually invoked a spectator after the compiling. should not be used in an existing viewer, each time a new window will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1978">A view in which all the holding points, with pointer numbers and conditions are listed. usually occurs at the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually occurs in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the link to debugger, in case required, or it dividing the plug-in with, on Debugangement. this action is triggered by default, when a project is opened, that does not need to be respected in the normal manner.</seg>

<seg id="1984">Points the debugger to begin with the execution of the script and information on the surveillance variables as well as the currently executing line. when this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. happens before a debit request started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points the debugger to start with the execution of the script, without information on surveillance variables and the current pointer number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution runs further. happens before a debit request was given, the execution starts when a request is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger leads the next statement in the script, without responding to the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger leads the next statement in the script, whereby if possible in functions and includes faulty error.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points the debugger to move the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current one.</seg>

<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declare whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in an easier way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a day XML document. it can only happen once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it does not contain only the item type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of the tag is a script feature. when using it, attr &gt; an argument to the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. returns the name of the class where this method belongs to. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a Commons Attributt and the attributes within this tag may be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a cutting-interface and a methodology. the arguments, which are passed to the method. can be empty or% per name%, that means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container-day grouped the elements of a list. it can happen for an attribute description only once. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Sets the position of the attribute of a tag within a dialogue. this day can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each one & lt; attr &gt; Day).</seg>

<seg id="2017">All TagXML files need to start with an & XML; -Declaration start: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 Encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neat and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces don't affect anything but pay attention & lt; character. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; especially in elements such as & lt; Tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt; shall be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>

<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scripting variable in the command line, like sh% scripting folder: $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantapSaul. if by & quantapSaul; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP to control & quantaplus; is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods, there can be a script input of & quantaplus; at the default application, you can determine what is to be sent to the default application. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input can also be redirected to the output of the conducted application. there are two kinds of issue: normal edition, directed to the default output. error messages, which shall be done with the text written output, by default the value of the listing edition is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group, so it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markups.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. pressing the New Action Knopfes at the bottom of the window starts the edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes has attributes and you plan their use, activate a dialogue "day editing" if available, so that a input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; use the & KMenu, graphics and other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Tox22 pixels.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol is not only helping you remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a button-button as a symbol. through the use of green (green is usually interpreted as less, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user is signalized, that Anck this symbol is one & lt; startled; -day in the current document will insert.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol, it must be associated with the action. this will be done via the menu with settings promotions... (in & quantapSaul;) and selecting the desired action. beside the text box is one button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the apply button and continue with other tags, so there are still, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantapete; -features to the toolbar or it should set them a better overview of some separators in multiple groups. open the toolbar to adjust the toolbar to make settings for settings. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element, that is to be added to the toolbar, push the arrow-button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to preview or add a quick way to access the queror. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how separators support grouping. anyone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & Conqueror; -button the opposite of the start-button is.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by proofing all the symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be imroot folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) if a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable enlargement of & quantaplus; for the normal user, the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter, how I create a & PHP; document-tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might be able to check in & quantapru; -Repository whether someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file. first part we leave you, the second we treat you here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration files [Tree] Doc you = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index = = Section1.html = Sec2.3.html = Sec2.3.html = Sec2.html &gt; 1 = tag2.html &gt; 2 = tag2.html &gt; 3 = tag2.html &gt; 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation so much:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction = Cretion.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-synchronic.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess telephones (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the index is referenced directly to a file (and consistent at the top of the Baumancy & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but watch on & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources cendateien.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content-section is the area of the docrc file which is to be displayed for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. through marking the function name and pressing by Ctrl; H for context-help, the documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Contacts) and the filtering lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of using twin-separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply and after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as stated in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation were used on the & quantapru; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the excremation of the resources (DTEP packages, tooling with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via e-mail to friends, partners or anyone else. at different locations there is an e-mail order menu, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP), using email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantapologies; -users can download it. the contributions are checked and only available when our team needs them as accurate and useless for publication. to make a more beneficial contribution, we recommend using the resources to be signed, why there is a GPG / PGP key. this means that the source of resources is ensured, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their personal GPG keys for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys you can choose to. in dialogue with new resource the input fields must be filled (URL preview can be empty) and by clicking on the uploading of OK the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can upload from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still prior to installation, examined & quantapSaul; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and signature. in the case of problems warns it and it can then be canceled. please note the warnings and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the statement of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages, which is currently not created by & quantapie. it can be time-consuming, because hundreds of tag files can be necessary on average XML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD automatically to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion from the DTD menu and converting a DTD can be started. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that is to be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directories: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition: the string that is written in! DOCTYPE Day, such as HTML Public / / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Tuning the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantapeth; after the conversion the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantapSaul; there are a few key concepts. to understand these and get full benefit from & quantaplus, so you have to start with these fundamental concepts. this chapter is trying to bring them precisely these concepts without their understanding & quantapprehensive.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantapology; the workspace is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantapology;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, who & quantapeth. use, available. from tooling on actions it is all that is marked as globally in the common folder structure of & quantapru; this enables the group of administrators different tool to secure actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolmaking. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns up to tool with special actions specifically for the files of a certain project. simply said this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree, making the common use of special tools and patterns from all the staff within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editing window, the building views, the cartoners with information and the toolbar. please suggest you in and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the card-leader with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current documents, such as close the current, other or all card caments, recharging, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editing area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content, how basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste / paste), edit the word under the mouse-cursor, or open the file, when the string is called under the mouse-cursor a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editing pane, the toolbar takes place. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolkit will be shown. in the course of further construction of & quantaplus, the toolbox will be adapted to the new functions and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really light. if they want to insert in their document, then click on the icon that represents the day. now, they can insert the data for this straight "tag. if you want to insert the data for this straight tag (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The components (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information about & quantapru; to navigate, to open and wander. in the presentation with Kartushes, you stand for files, project, model templates, document structure, scripts, and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantapie. this view displays all the files in the project and allows the caretops of the files in the project by means of right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading or delete the files from the storage media can then be performed with the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. nearly everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. the category is always available, local templates are available only for the corresponding user and assists in projects are available only in the project. more information is found in templates.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking on the right mouse button, you can access the available information on a script via right mouse button, such as the script to start, edit or send email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. through left-clicking on the element, the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. through the right click of an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other structural views. with it can change some attributes and namespace. this allows the modification of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. it can be pre-packed documentation for & quantapSaul; from quantapore; 'document site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project may be added to project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantapeth; two cards are rated at the bottom of the window, which can be reached via beneficial information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This card-player shows information about each in Quanta ongoing script. so, for example, the DTD used in the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This card-player shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantapSaul; scripts that are executed, give any error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolkit can be expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the Choadeseite of the toolbar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar by e-mail. & quantapSaul; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar-archive over & mail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, they can provide them in & quantapete; how any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantapete; modify files on your system. for this, auto-conf has a number of options to get to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help one. the options are simple to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantapeth, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 I folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before their bin folder. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web-development tool optimized for the KDE-surface. & quantapSaul; has been optimized for a quick web development and combines a matured development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; -editor began to create the developers of & quantaplus; a separate, extensible markup language editor would be? well, this would make him an absolutely greatest web-development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now on the way to a general and comprehensive Web-development tool. together, you should define it in & XML; then you should & quantapSaul; to be the suitable & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be recorded that & quantapeth; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer's community is based. thanks to the & kde; -Scst is not only that possible anything but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to extend the way they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantapSaul; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can enhance the productivity almost every task. through the program compose, they can have & quantaplus; extend without having to remember a scripting language tax. (more information they find in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast design development and quickly became a matured editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers settled the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details and documentation is with help: / quanta (either do this URL in & conqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / quanta perform).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffluitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list is changing every time you open a file that is not on it, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and entire files as templates for later use. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project prediction, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts with inserting the clipboard contained there special characters to the & HTML; -prescription, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -prescription, which is the correct way to insert special characters and space in & URL; s is primarily used to insert & URL to the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Unlock the block selection, or out. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; -script error messages out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Is searching for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type of grep or sed with GUI and pre-defined expressions, to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. that's the window where you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"" "" "" "education and switching of the problem-reporters at the bottom of the & quantapeth. the main problem of the problem reporter is activated once you change to the structural tree." ""</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolspold left from the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next, depending on the position of the ursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the harddisk. & quantapSaul; projects will be stored with the file .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files are then copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched the project directory according to new files that could be there. this allows to copy, e.g. graphics files into your project folders or subfolders and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded another entry / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, how & quantapSaul; the project managed. in the chapter & quantapSaul; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are kept in project You / toolbars and are only available in this menu, if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be defined by means of settings... can be stored on tool-making tool store or you will be asked when you want to store the tool.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of sight. it does not delete them from the hard disk. if you have not saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you would like to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to that & quantapsed; -team so that the toolbar will be present in the next release). the menu item opens a new e-mail message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of machine tools to the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Invite one & DTD; that you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantapiro; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the Entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities are to be refreshed from the & DTEP, without renew the whole & DTEP; if this global is and a Stationf in the global KDE folder is not available, the loading fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day-setting dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags always, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivated the intelligent inserting of tags. currently this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inserts means that & quantapSaul; inserting using toolbar if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed among the above-mentioned menu points. click on it. click the activated-plugins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Elects the syntaxonomous mode for the current file. the list of available herseals depends on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of pointer identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to create. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application of tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant change between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the constituting sometimes need time or uncomfortable graphics. recommended is the cartels mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantapru; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. with a selection of a single-window, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Displays the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantapeth; main code on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influences each application, which use the KHTML-Part, including the & Conqueror; -Webbrowser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Judge the behavior of the editing pane. in the documentation of & Kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears when you delete entries from the toolbox, or which you can add and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should produce a help according to the environment of the mouse, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantapSaul; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project the developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantapSaul; development in financial form, they find the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out at the top from top to bottom, as for example after filling the project name the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author-information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project project properties are set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering Name, file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">That is the name of the & quantapSaul; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without space, with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address, to which one wants to access, one, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.unprecedented) or an IP-address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar can be saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbar. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local file system to the project. multiple files or whole folder can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static webcontent you want to download and change. with serversed script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files are required somewhere in the main folder of the project, if a project is started anew, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option will display all the files and folders inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good vouchers.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by clicking, or, by removing the tick, cling from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings which simplify your work. these settings can be loaded in the menu with project properties in the subwindow profiles in the subwindow profiles, or with the shortcut Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (Placeholder is possible) that will be re-read in project-related operations such as the project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"" "" "" "projections, which is being loaded when opening the project. in addition, more about project views can be read." ""</seg>
<seg id="2172">This enables the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information on Gubed can be found in. the debugger-Plugin can be adjusted with the button options. in case the debugger is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Upload profiles can be set in the subwindow profiles (see in), as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile, by drafting a separate construction view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration you can switch event actions and add these actions, change or delete. event actions will be executed when a specific event occurs, such as the scanning of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantapSaul open; the last project that was open. this behavior cannot be influenced.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as expansion.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantapeth; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will ask if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantapeth. changed files occurs. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manoeuvre provides free access to the files in the project. there, the files in the current project can be managed.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are likewise missing, however the entries are missing and open with... within the right mouse-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the top-to-read files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only more a profile is available, the button is canceled, to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forget about programing. this possibility is useful when frequent uploading files is necessary and the rather unsecured password saved on the record -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantapSaul; many high-profile profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) are uploaded to various servers. with editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server, to which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified Domainname or an IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the KIO slaves. at least you should choose & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually this does not have to be changed except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use them at your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it can not be read easily, but everyone with programming can easily see in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and tool. there can be a lot of views in one project, i.e. by simple exchange of view, various files and tool can be loaded and replace the current files and toolbox.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved in the menu project or project toolbar, accessible via settings toolbar toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantapham; at its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are tool-made in & quantaplus; best to make use of the tool toolbar. use and add-to. the addition of toolbar will be handled in the addition of toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols can be set in either using Context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which new toolbar can be set out, can designate other actions like toolbar, which can be specified in dialogue, where actions on this or other tool can be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, in addition the entries will remove action and processed the action, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up the menu with settings toolset... and set settings promotions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentaries, code cutlets and files for linkages. & quantaplus; uses templates, basically like a nasty file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link each of the existing directory in the prefabrication tree. templates have in & quantapSaul; in about the limitations you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus, provided Templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each presentation.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binar is all that is not purer text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually included in documents using linkups (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the prefabrication tree under global templates. further information on the Template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be compiled by any text document. based on these templates, new documents can be compiled in appropriate subfolders. normally, specific scaffoles are prepared for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate manner to be efficient. some examples can be found in the prefabrication tree under global templates. see in for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is supposed to be inserted on a template, but the same text area again and again into documents. some examples are found in the prefabrication tree on Javascript or Perl. some examples are found in the prefabrication tree under global templates. see in for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, serve these templates for entire websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a zipped tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantapham.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a documentation structure according to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose file as a template save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, you notice that (although it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the prefabrication tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file as a template save as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragging and dragging on the belly-view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The production of binary templates is simple: the file can only copy into one template folder. it can be used all file management functions, such as pulling and derivative or inserting via the file tree of conqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a name in the file tree or in the project files building view to a folder on the right and secure site template, which will be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very target-oriented pre-oriented procedure. you can insert headlines and footers or link dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or link with them. additionally you can keep some things when using templates in projects very profound in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The pre-structure structure in the subwindow template is based on the files presented in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / Templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / Templates. each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder is in the prefabrication overview with the right mouse button to click on the folder and to select in the context menu features. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is canceled as soon as Elterly attributes impeed hailed.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regulators inside the predisposition. if a root folder would be set, unless they would be explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-tree, if nothing appears, one is probably in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows provided or recorded text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footer for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip the headlines into a folder with special headlines / footers for a whole presentation with the matching headlines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a right-click menu (to show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; - Editor and VPL; & source code editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the editing window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch if needed to the source code, in which the changes performed in VPL; -Editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; -editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; -Editor, continues to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to alter this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes both in the source code Editor and in the VPL; -Editor will be activated, this mode is already active, the keypress puts the active cursor from a window to the other, where the position of the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation unit between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is adjustable in settings Quanta. in addition, you can select between synchronisation to a click or automatically. in addition, the selection will be adjusted in addition to the time period. basically the recommendation is: a small spanish for fast machines and a big spanish for slow speed.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to select the document properties. thus, the editing of invisible tags in the work with the VPL; editor will also be called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor will be created. this allows the reduction of the suspension code. thus, one can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information on the document themselves e.g. to keywords for Internet search engines. Meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. one click into the list enables modification of the content, e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS-rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the meta-elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to bind an external CSS-style installation by pressing the file-open button and choose the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the Cursors is like in a text processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing, and deleted via back-clicking or remove-button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be made in the same way via tool editing, as in the source code editor. it is to note that inserting tags before already existing identical tags, e.g. if an anchor day, surrounded by text, each other creates anchor day will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar such as the tables or the lists assistant are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used tool.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; it is a tool for the examination of style templates. in contrast to other programs for style templates, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of style preconditions can be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; successfully compile them except & kde; still the libraries libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are available at a typical installation of & kde; already available.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Perform the conversion 20 times when --the two-fold column is specified, the conversion will be executed 100 times</seg>
<seg id="2272">The input documents are treated as HTML files when the support has been activated in libxml</seg>
<seg id="2273">Activates the Xinclude processing of the input document, when the support has been activated in libxml. this is switched as default</seg>
<seg id="2274">On systems with installed readline library, you can browse the arrow buttons on / off through the expires of the previous commands.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Several commands require more than one argument. quotes may be used to pass existing expressions as an argument. & eg;: with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as an argument, a holding is set in a file named "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."</seg>
<seg id="2276">Template _ NAME: a valid name of a template that consists only of the ASCII character 0x00 to 0x7F. this name can be a fully qualified name as "XSL: templateName."</seg>
<seg id="2277">Filename: a valid local file on the system of the user. on Unix- or Cygwin systems, the name may have the prefix "~" as a short form for the personal folder. on RISC-OS systems, other environment variables are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="2278">Path: a path to the changes of the workstation. on some operating systems the prefix "~" will be replaced with the path to your personal folder.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Data: the XML-data or the XML _ document, which is edited by the style of style. see also & lt; FILENAV; and & lt; URIts;</seg>
<seg id="2280">Running command: {bye _ BAR _ exit _ BAR _ quit}, step, stepup, stepdown, next, push, run, track, options</seg>
<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & # 3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The reunion was very complicated because one of the contributors had been made up of many changes and at the same time had corrected the reciration at the same time. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the results were numerous conflicts related.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the modified lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the intimidation had changed. that result of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & Kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white signs. later, any quantity of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quickly text, just copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparator window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost to a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way compound is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected outcome. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files at the same time:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& Kdiff3; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & Casdiff3; perform the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Kdiff3; displays the exact differences and serve as a result of the possibilities of current collateral monitors. if you often have to verify code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tablers are visible are visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if someone is getting the withdrawal.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is identical, and the other differs in a line then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same name, but in different folders, then you can ease the tipwork by just writing the filename of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">3 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner1 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows the manual type of file name, the selection across the file browser (file...) or selecting a least open file from the list. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing or merge folders is introduced, for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & Casdiff3; the filenames from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If together, the input field is active and can be applied. however, it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately. you can get this step later on save.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. you can set options before you start working with the default.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes one does not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & Kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparator window. the comparison begins immediately. in open dialog you do not need to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the break -button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use ornamental and Ableges: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind this? sometimes a file contains for example multiple similar functions. if you want to find out how similar to these functions, it would have been a relatively large amount of effort. you would have to upload two relevant files, they in & kdiff3; now you can copy the relevant sections simply copy, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment you cannot drag anything from & # 3; only the dropping text is supported in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dragging of text into another program as excerpts and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box is the info line. the info-line of the code window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info-line has a different color. (when the path leads to a file too long, let the mouse rest a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a, the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed by the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees the color that file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text there is the constituent column. when differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +), white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the processor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that divides the composition column of the text is suspended at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the pointer is enabled, the line is dotted on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison table) also has a info-line with the wording output:, the filename and [change] when you have worked the result. usually it contains already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are disbanded, save is saved!!! (use the buttons to find stem / unresolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts remaining.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict of manually being solved.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the first line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (thus, a jump from the position in the windows is displayed.) This group is then highlighted the current group. it is highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic merge or by manual do no more line will be left in the group; then, in these lines the text & lt; no line is displayed in the file; it is only a wildcard in the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final file, nor in a marker you might want to copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; performance conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources list the options to ignore or ignore ignores C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates navigates mainly with the images and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you're in one of the windows, you can also use the arrows left, right, end, Strg-begin and shrg end, siw like you can also use it from other programs. the crossing column next to the vertical image bar can also be used for navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Augmentation window you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the inserting button, you can switch between insertion and rewriting mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button, in one of the interconnective columns, the view of all windows is synchronized to the beginning of the respective group (as described in the section and explained the editable window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl / Ctrl / Ctrl), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl / Ctrl / Ctrl), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl / Ctrl / Ctrl) or to the manual. therefore, there must be differences of resolved and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker into the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl inserts). if it is enabled, whatever you mark, automatically copy into the clipboard and the manual copying falls. be careful with this option but you could write so the contents of the clipboard accidently override.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Pointers are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a line pop-up\\ r\. Kdiff3 keeps the pointer of source files not in, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored to the next start. (Menu Pinjun- &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also poses texts with variable width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in recursive script. if the scripture does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors might not be available in its pure form, but would be astered. on these systems the button settings will automatically be an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the pressing button is inserted in the pressing button with the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tab is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you input or return Return, the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy into the clipboard then falls.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same of files we try to locate all completely identical lines into source files. only during this first step can be ignored white signs. the second step compares each line. in this step white signs will not be ignored. in this step white signs will not be ignored. also, white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a wagon range '\' r 'and a pointer type'\ 'at the end of a line, others again only save a line scanning'\ '. when this option is enabled, car returns to be visible, however like a white sign. during the default, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting, this option is disabled. in the first part of analysis the numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result, the differences will be displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default setting, this option is disabled. changes in commentary will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively searching for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically jump-jump mode determines this attitude how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Soldering automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white signs are less important in many files. notice that the automatic selection also concerns conflict in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore ignores C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning of folders and transmissions of a compilation. look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, then the original version is displayed the Suffix .orig. if already exist such a backupfile with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to finish & # 3; exit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & Kdiff3; not available, because the language is set global across the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following codes can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for encoding appears a short note about what the local coding is. (this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreting. as the coding is adjustable for each file individually, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have processed a file, you can choose which coding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, they might not be working with your codec. (e.g., your files could be 16-bit Unicode), but this option can only set the coding output of the output editor command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress release changes in white characters in the text or checkbox. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignores C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode all the differences are displayed in a color-coded transfer column. but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files; B, A & B; -gt; C or B & lt; -C is indicated next to the normal still a second passing column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd like to use the space available on the screen rather for long lines. just add the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Specify the comparisons close to each other or to each other. this can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide immediately to bring the files together. a simple click starts the gathering and uses the filename of the last source file as the default file name. (when this function is used to restart the file, then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is presented to this external command first. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that equates exactly your requirements. you can use this feature e.g. to cut disturbing parts or to correct the reciration.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is presented to this external command first. if the command of the command is stated above, then the output of the command is used only when the pointer is used. you can write your own Preprocessor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input row must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind this is to provide the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program requires, and most users do not want to program it yourself. the good news is however, that in most cases sed or perl completely suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this editor command to change the input into large letters: sed's /\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The\\ 1 in the initial text string.\\ U converts the found text in large letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to add automatically generated character chains (info: / cvs / keyword\\ _ BAR _ header\\ (revision\\)\ _ BAR _ header\\ (revision\\)\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\), because $a special sign is required and the end of the line.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed experimenting, you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions, even. they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line-up. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g'Each sign between '[' and ']' is a hit, and each displaying is replaced by nothing, thus practically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple requirements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the compositions from one another. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use something else like perl usage. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allerdings are required at perl some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the set'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and actuating. further operations only change the data that may see the line-up algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal Preprocessor, the pointer is similar to the normal Preprocessor command as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with each function, the text changes or differences hidden, you may not accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in one folder. for this reason you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate that simulate and shows the simulated changes without completing it really,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... introduces selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the comparing and merge of individual files very similar. you just need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as base. if no target folder was specified, & # 3; Ordner3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not result together. to launch this, you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During inserting the folder you will be informed of a small news window above the current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only those files are listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & # 3; a list window with the results on the left-hand side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Every file and each folder that was found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded. you can double click on the + / - click on the object or by using the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories and select all subdirectories that you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file will be restarted and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column Name reflects the type of file in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the data type is different in the different folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case the contraction is not automatically chosen, you will be informed about the problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above image are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are regarded as identical if its entire contents is identical. then also folder the same color. with folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a leaf re-green, which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, extinguish the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, extinguish the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, extinguish the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of data (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: contradictory types of file. as long as such faulty objects exist, this can not merge together.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same type of data (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: contradictory types of file. as long as such faulty objects exist, this can not merge together.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to syncing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folders were specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & Kdiff3; the necessary action to be identical to that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after the result copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are summed together and select the new file instead of conduction (unsafe) then examines & # 3; the date of the files and proposing the newer file to copying. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors can not be eliminated, this can not merge the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge one file will work after the others. it's status column shows Done when the result was successful, and according to other messages, when something unexpectedly entered. if that is completed, you should check out a final review and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file-method complete analysis is chosen, Kdiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unsolved, solder, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or collapsed.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all of your CV actions (also in all subfolders), you can merge it together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified any destination folder, then in the three-folder mode, C is chosen as the target and will be used to syncing B and / or B as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options given by certain entries to be skipped. check these options to avoid unleaking surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring all entries together: choose directories / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut shortcut). to perform only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If through conflicting data types still exist invalid actions, a message appears to indicate the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialogue window will appear with the options running, simulate and aborting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulation if you only want to see what would happen without the really changes done. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual is necessary (merge a single file) then a composite window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select once again directories / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialogue appears. then, & Kdiff3; his work with the next item continues.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, you will find a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you see some error messages that should help you to select the cause of the problem. if you choose this again (F7 key), lets you choose to select a different action for entry or solve the problem in a different way before you merge with this.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually merged, these entries (in the current session) and then leads them together at the later date. even if here that has been assembled or not saved, these entries will change as settled. only if you change the merge action, these entries are brought together again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & codiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3 set...) now has a section called directory sheet with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files which apply to the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. if you separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid space-card: '*' and '?'. (eg * .cpp; * .h). the default directory is *. folder do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders conform to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid space-card: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders conform to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid space-card: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-generalized files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .cvsignore file. (see below info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a version. in other filesystems, a postulate score marked as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: when the option is switched off, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When left to folder: when the option is switched on, the links like normal folder will be dealt with and recursively searched. (note that & Kdiff3; not checking on possible recurrensions. a link to a folder of a link on himself would lead to a final loop and & crdiff3; plunges.) This option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file through and displays statistics columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binational analysis, and essentially slower if they are applied to files that does not contain text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">When you compare major folders via a slow network, it may possibly be faster, just change the change date and the file size. however, this speed system will cost you a certain amount of security. please use with caution. this option is replicated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to a change of change. there is no real comparison instead of. the files are considered identical if they're identical. this can be useful for example when copying the changeling date. please use with caution. this option is replicated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the syncing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder. in this mode, the proposals will be summarized so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results from the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead the copying of the newer file is proposed as action. (this will be considered unsafe because it's knowledge that the other file is not also changed. you should consider it in any case.) This option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced by another, then the original version is renamed and will get the extension .original. if an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, this will also be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merge individual files, not just the merge whole folder. this option is switched on in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder can merge together with the merge individual files visible; you can switch the window-divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the option directory in the window menu and switch between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file by means of double-clicking it. however, you can also merge a single file directly without the folder file. once you save the result, the status will be done and the file will not be assembled once you launch the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost when you re-read the directory once again: list menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders for opening up on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on FTP server. the second command line compares a folder in a closed archives with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a couple of things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undound. or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be milled. (# - &gt;% 23, blank boxes &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. it follows a brief list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder indicates. then there is always a file as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process privileges or change of change. therefore, the permissions or change date from the original. (note the option of trust in size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of reference is currently available as differences-spectator in KDevelop. KDevelop first always starts the built-in differences. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button above the differences-viewer and then select In Crediff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually, & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a part, the input file is a patch file in the Unified format. then, & Kdiff3; the names of original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files needs to exist. then starts & Kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the context menu, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview - Kdiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. besides, this is unreliable, if the original files since the creation of the patch file have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & Kdiff3; as part carried out, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. that merge or the comparing folders is not supported in the box mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now Heis it compare) already exists. also the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 out of the Diff Tool-Tool.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by playing in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or so go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be disclosed to the correct prefix for KDE. in the default configuration, configure / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more detailed information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs are different, these lines are treated as identical. however, if only a non-white sign is different, the line is considered not identical. if similar lines are used next to each other, this the is the purpose this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will remember any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking into the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is however lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is a lot of effort to design additional a separate file format which could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can re-establish a specific version through selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger amounts of text should be used, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src linted; no src appeared and the text does not delete. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already use many colors for the uplifting of differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and misses the purpose. use another editor for it.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Lots of good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To make use of all functions of & codiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information about how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE, you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest modifications can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in the quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & checkm3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & Kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsafe, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; car and automake is used, you should not have any problems with compiling. nevertheless, difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailinglists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or switching) copies into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or switching) adds the text from the clipboard to the current Curtain position or replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders, and consequently do not appear in the folder folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read changes to these options the folder with the function Refresh.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">These files are only displayed to display the differences. that also results that identical files do not already exist in the target folders. if the target folder these files will not already exist, they are missing after that. (the behavior will probably be updated in a later program version.) This option is switched off in the default folder.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons on selecting the source with the lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if the lines already exist), they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default setting, this option is disabled. Underdifferences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kcamp; displays a thumblook of all virtual working spaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the workspace to change their size, they end or move it. this works both inside a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kcamp; can display all virtual work surfaces, as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved to work space and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can move windows inside & kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & kpager; then, the context menu has only the two entries of Pager... and ending. if however, click on an application inside of & kisses; then, the context menu and the name of the application and the entries are minimizing, maximizing, on working surface and ending. the commands make the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizing the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only when applied to an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only if applied to an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">Is this cross box marked, can windows inside the bed-camp; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working spaces are moved.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & kpager; the names of virtual working spaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Ticking this field leaves the bed-camp; the numbers of virtual workspace are displayed. together with name, it is displayed together with name, the names are provided with Ordinalnumbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each work surface is also displayed as background in the & kcamp; it is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as a small window in the & box. otherwise, only the empty workspace will be shown to make their choice.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here, the view of the program window is selected. simple spelling with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the windows with its default symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. remark: pixmap is only recommended for very quick systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here can be the arrangement of the & kpager; -main window; in a 2xn-buttons, how from Pager applications appear in some other windowels; wavering shows all virtual working spaces in a horizontal and vertical set, which is very good for displaying lateral on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature in the control panel. he has the advantage that it can be changed in size, displaying the windows as symbols or with its content. besides, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button in the box; and then select the switch-up... let the dialog settings appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog Settings. but you can do this manually:</seg>

<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button depressed, so you can catch the content of the magnifier and shift. this also goes with the arrow buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift; push-down or use the & MMB; you can postpone the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left-left corner of the selection track remains firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousette tool; emulates just a mouse click on the same spot. it is thought to help people experiencing the repetitive Strainist Injury (RSI) Syndrome and where any mouse clicks prepares pain. besides, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this does however require a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousette tool; can handle the pain that comes when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without hurt. unfortunately, you can also encounter pain that are linked with the use of your computer, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify things again: even if & kmousette, pain helps to avoid using the mouse, it is against pain, which is caused by the mouse due to the mouse, useless. and as with all the ergonomic means, the result can vary for each other.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousette tool; is simple: & kmousette; monitors your mouse movements and causes a mouse-click as soon as you break the motion in short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent wiring activated, makes & kmousette; a break after it puts the mouse button down. now move the mouse, waits right down until the end of the movement, before getting the mouse button down. this way, you can carry out the pulling off button. the intelligent wiring requires a little exercise, but you get used quickly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This distortion period must be petrified after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousette; one mouse click out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is intelligent wiring switched on, the swivel right time (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time is set to drag the & kmousette; after downloading the mouse-mouse, before it leaves the mouse again, if there is no time for mouse on the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousette tool. this function is now activated, creates a slow step after right and back, followed by a break, one click with the right mouse button. a slow step after left and back leads a double-click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousette tool; the first time will be started, but they can be modified later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move & kde; to shorten the reaction time. to do so, go to Sound & Multimedia, choose sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider sound buffer that you adjust to a lower value to shorten the answer.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Is this setting marked, becomes & kmousette tool; at every start of & kde; at the moment, this feature is currently only available at & kde. please check the respective documentation at the rate to find out how to automatically launch a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings on the values adjusted when opening the dialogue. have you already pushed the button, the settings will be reset to the state after the latest release.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best way to use you & kmousette; first of all, you should let off the smart settings. if you then click to the automatic mouse click, you can later increase the smart step.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the responses of & kde; to reduce sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse-click without effect stays: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window, which does not display a link, does not lead to unauthorized reactions. you can therefore park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse rests, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse gel but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you must remove the mouse gel. as this happens, mouse to mouse differently. it should be quick, however, if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'll have to see the roles. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the soiling can be easily scratching with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousette; if there is just a sliding runway. if you're in this case the intelligent wiring means that the surgery can no longer quit through the slogan of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousette; under a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can perform yourself a mouse click. this is reset to & kmousette, and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousette; continue to perform mouse clicks and puts the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it. however, you don't want to use the mouse on a neutral section of desktop, if you are a scaturetic reactions. so you can't make sure that the mouse-cursor is unseasoned reactions. safe zones for the mouse-cursor are unseasoned reactions. safe zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart hiding place, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent wiring is an advanced function of & kmousette; and it takes time before you can handle it. it's very likely to copy text to copy it into the clipboard and move it into the clipboard, or move into any other action, in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. but there will be some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Don't use the intelligent wiring if you just begin using & kmousette tool. select text instead like this: lead the mouse button depressed, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and then push the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse-click. thus, any sound is played like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the smart relocating the relocating time. later, you can use the intelligent wiring even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousette; it needs to be the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and speaker, and that is correct.</seg>

<seg id="2593">Most TTS-Synthesizers offer different languages and voices, so also different male or female, or those that are referred to in volume or speed. you can at least set up several variations for a synthesizer. you should at least set up a spokesman before calling & ktts; otherwise, as the speed-dispatcher otherwise uses the default ones.</seg>
<seg id="2594">Various speakers for the same synthesizer are comparable to several printer spools for the same printer.</seg>
<seg id="2595">If you click on the card-rated speaker in kttsmgr, the card card speaker is displayed. this will also appear automatically when you launch kttsmgr and not yet a spokesman.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktops. for normal working with & ktops; filters are not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering, text will be edited, before being sent to the program speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation in order to choose wrongly spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to bypass certain shortcomings of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech dispute" works with a text. & ktops; sets four types of text.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen saver has the highest priority. it will pass on all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the Screen Readers is read, the orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warning have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is becoming hotly reserved. a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and regular text. these orders are continued after the release of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message interrupted normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that can read messages. while you want to read a long text on a website, you can welcome to & kmouth; somebody who just enter the room. & kde; messages also are news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order that you encounter from the cartel card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output longer texts that have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are labeled in queue, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen readers, while & ktts; just such a prereads, this issue will be stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen devices. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text messages as well as on & kde; -News applied.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter parameters the text and pass it on to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there can be even further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Inserters replace parts of a text by other text. the subset parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. it will be delivered with predefined strings as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & Conversation; or & mail; in a better understanding.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Reformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to a different format. within the scope of & D; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With Interphone editors you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program, sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. if you have set a female voice for example, you can read text by KDE messages about it. Siehe. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it will apply for a language issue. if the filter does not indicate that its rules cannot apply, he continues the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; message on & ktts; will be sent to them by all activated filters which have been set up on the page below. the editing through the filters takes place in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of standard normal filters. if a filter is not crossed, it is not active and is not used. filter are labeled down from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2638">A list of words or regular expressions are required to enter a list of words or regular expressions. these patterns will be found in the text, then the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitution text. large and microsensitive is not considered when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Type your filter a name. you can choose this name as you like, but you just have to distinguish yourself from the name of the other filter.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column, and replaces it in accordance with the string chain from the column. the list is shown in the order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2646">The insertion filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions are applied with an entry in the box Did filter if match. are all input fields blank, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words the character filter detector is used in the form\\ s word\\. the words must therefore be limited by separator (space characters).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Currently & ktts. SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (british male) as this is the default ones, the festival is used in the SSML edition.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and satellite filters (SDA filter). SBDs can start reading text in single phrases. this can only be synthesized, not the whole text order. thus, you can also jump in or withdraw from card orders, even if the language synthesizers does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the satellite connection filter. at the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up as a demonstration filter. you can change its settings, or add further satellite characteristics, but beginner from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the easiest way you learn the setting of intersex selection by trying out. place the speaker choices here, change some features and check how the selection of the microphone changed. this requires, of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then start to start reading, since only the first sentence must be processed and not the whole text block, which can take very long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or interrupt the card orders, even if the language synthesizers does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal typology filter is automatically set up, if you start kttsms for the first time. it can not be switched off, just removed. change nothing about this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Satellite character filters compare text with a regular expression for typing and add a tab (decimal code 8) to the typing limits (tab) before the filtering automatically from the text). notice that the standard satellite wrapping filter will be attached.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages, warnings, messages or the output of Screen Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from Versee the normal typology filter, you can insert it again by loading the file _ sbdrc contained in & ktops.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card holder's choice, you can write the speaker settings for the application. the card card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the card holder). in other words, no intersex features are set.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable microphone, which shows all the properties of an equipped intercom. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the microphone, select & ktts; this speaker. otherwise, select & ktts; the speaker from, the most commonly asked features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired speaker properties, by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired microphone. if this property does not matter, do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Highlight this cross box when the property is to take precedence over other properties. you can also set several marks here.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf; a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which enables the administration of network interfaces, the routine and the DNA settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings over a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be viewed through selection of K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module for network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; display the module settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched through selection of ccontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware is not able to install. physical devices and their drivers have to be fully installed and configured so that & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and enables setting the network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices at the Installing & Linux; are installed and installed. networks are later added, the drivers have to be loaded via adaptation of the following files, according to the core version, are loaded:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module settings will be loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module, it tries to detect the platform used on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the Custom's selection is offered. it is the platform out of the list that the distribution and the release version is best corresponds to. selecting the setting up non-re-ask the definition can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings, then this selection will be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system-administration mode. previously all options are displayed grey, which means the settings can be viewed only, changing it is not possible. in the system administration mode, you can enter the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the total functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tab:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are shown. from the tab network, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Setting up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... setup the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click on the "" "" Advanced Settings "" "" settings and displays the dialogue with further options. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2811">By selecting Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP information is required for each system start, therefore no further adjustment is required. in the selection list can be selected either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manuell can be made without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field. in the input field, network mask is determined.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initializes the network interface with the boats. if the initialization does not wish, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values used in this dialog are displayed as attributes of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or off-off according to demand. switching on an integrated network device is provided by selecting from the list and click-click interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or off-off according to demand. off-off of a activated network device is made by selecting from the list and click of the interface.</seg>

<seg id="2819">If the computer is present more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network, where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support is replaced by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses. if the machine http includes http: / / www.einedomain.org, the DNS detector this name into an IP address like 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator to the naming solution part of the rider's naming allows an easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified .DNS entries can be re-ordered by selecting a single insertion and execution or gradation in the list with the buttons or can be arranged in the priority.</seg>

<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of the binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is sufficient when & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & Console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphically surface such as copackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but in addition, the development packages with libraries and other libraries are required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended for only experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second all of & knetworkconf; modify configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great circulation. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description focuses on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is assign to a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator that applies to a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be easily chosen.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When putting your own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the internet, therefore its any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by hiring a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the two-back address (localhost = the own machine). the standard route is required for the IP redirecting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The unit address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. usually, the address is 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes altered in DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in case of an active DSL connections to other content than specified there.</seg>

<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a change of the symbol for the band to realize that integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be cast out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat; it must be used by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A Bandarten must be formatted before you have to be used for storing data. this procedure does not require the formatting at & kdat; it does not have to happen before you pass from the volume of & kdat files. Floppy drives are usually set up a formatting of the bances, DAT drives, however not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the belt name and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the bonds. all the data on the tape are lost. after completion of the formatting, the volume is automatically involved and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you have to select the most secure files. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only be saved to this file or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Highlight a backup profile in a tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in local file tree with a hooks. only the marked files and / or subfolders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Please click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu Sigol...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup started is opened, the dialog settings for backup. in this dialog you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialog appears to backup. dialogue shows the progress of the backup process, including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives on the drive for the drive. it is only checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in an entry for the band with a hooks. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click on one of the archives in one of the archives and select the test entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process has been started, the dialog settings for verification. in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the workspace for the check.</seg>
<seg id="2914">"" "" "" "if you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialogue appears supervise. this dialogue shows the progress of the process and the data throughput and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can restore the Restore, the files that are to be restored will be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that are included for the tape's work. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a hooks. only the selected files and / or subfolders are restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Restore menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog settings for recovery. in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the workspace for the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the settings for restoration, dialogue appears to be regenerated. this dialog shows the progress of the progress process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to regenerate the band's indexfile from the band's content. this procedure deletes all existing Indexfile for this band. you can regenerate the index on two types from the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder in which the backup should be made. the list of secure files will be automatically updated according to the selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, is considered only the files currently being stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folder, which are on other filesystem, you can list separately under backup files. each entry is viewed from tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files stored since then have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling from tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons are fettered; and lt; lt; files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the KDat menu... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to device processing (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-reone version of the belt system.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting active, conveyed & kdat; before the band is involved the command will be flushed to the drive. with some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option enabled, tries to block & kdat; to block the reproach in the belt drive. possibly this attitude does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, in solving the integration of & kdat files; automatically the band is ejected. do not use this option with floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option enabled, tries to change & kdat; not all drives support variable blocks sizes. regardless of whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the block size for your band's drive will communicate.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the belt. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n) The band ID. the format of this string is calculator: seconds, where calculator the full name of the system is formatted on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named in the folder $HOME / .kdat files.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar manage. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not the incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup job. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; the viewer is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where to get information about your system or where the system is stored in the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features, with their help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, presents & ksystemlog; functions at your disposal, with their help the single log lines of a log file easily filter and sort out. the individual possibilities for sorting and filter are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries to open & amp log; first the main protocol-file of the system - the system Protocol - is not displayed, and it opens instead of a small news window, so you have & ksystemlog; very probably not with system management rights. the protocol files usually do not have a permission to read for the normal user.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also filter the filter bar in order to filter on a selected criterion or according to the filtering string. in the default setting, the drop-down list contains next to the filter. in the default setting, the selection box contains next to the filter that is displayed once, when in one of the columns the string of the filter is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select a different entry at this point. select the string process using the entries in the selected column. select for example in the filter bar the name of a process, so showing you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a spicuous color than protocol lines of level critic. the colored description of protocol lines can be switched off furniture dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (for example in the system protocols or in the cron protocol), so you can test the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, you can use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option for new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub-windows and manage. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more current information on the supply sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you will also find in the following directory of the & kde; Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in the & kde; - Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system develops fast to the standard for control of the program starts at the high level of the system in the & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binder is below / sam and not below / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to put a machine on System V Init without a reinstallation and new format. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder means rc.sysinit and the following further folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service that you would like to start the system or change to another running level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as settes, which is just started once. such calls include rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems own this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also create a rc.in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something that has to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for different places after the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line in the beginning as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably determine that the default running level 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you have done something through, then you come repaired by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the correct scripts? if you ls -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that no correct files are in this folder. instead, each entry is here a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it's an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would keep the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it includes a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will be called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way of running machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level, which leaves just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc., in addition, I could also have a user-running level, which starts & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of your disposable system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between Runleveln, or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will only happen if they draw an entry from the area of the disposable system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you want to drag them into a new area. to copy them on a new Runlevel, you must select copying from the menu or paste from the context menu -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to include system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different workspaces (availables, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it into the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an item manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of loss of data, all entries in the menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysv; otherwise they will be stored by & ksysv; restored. changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I've been experimenting with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for the execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (LD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way systems are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary interface programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all the configuration files are available, which are required of the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) just quit without notice if their configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & cuser; start it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you made changes, you must save it. either use the icon of the toolbar or entry save in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& B user; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, user interface and the user group. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user interface or group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some carton cards are only shown if you have enabled space settings (Quota) for users, a cardboard card will be made, where you can make individual settings. other card cards appear, if shadow codes, or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD boxes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-card password appears, if shadow codes, or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card-card only appears when activated and initializing (Quota) file (Quota) is activated and initializing (recognizable at the file quota user / quota group on the filesystem). here, for each user parameters can be modified, the amount of information in the KB include:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected by the field file filesystem with space limit.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card holder provides information on the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user is heard, can be a member in the field of primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by changing them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add of the menu User or group or click the matching button of the toolbar. editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group will be analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager to remove the BootPassword, remove and change the time until the default operating system, remove the standard business system, remove, change the operating system, change, change and more.</seg>
