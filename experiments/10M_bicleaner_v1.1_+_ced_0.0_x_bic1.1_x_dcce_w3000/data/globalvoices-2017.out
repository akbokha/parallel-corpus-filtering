although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
as many of my generation I also grew up with American films , I have danced to American music , American writers were read and made his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly made for an American film journalist .
when 14 years I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ let letter , a terrible re@@ porter who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura Stu@@ dents , the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil magn@@ ates who were the Supreme Court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
free according to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was , as if it &apos;s the absolute truth , I forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only been reinforced .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very black@@ ish love letter written about his size .
then , Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written about xen@@ ophobia and racism this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as it goes with his narrow @-@ minded approach .
he never stops in his mind behind the mountain , as he says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and Women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 13 million votes won in the republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever achieved by the Party candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t bring Tru@@ mp and his voters with people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism program , came up from around the world , a profound person to whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tru@@ mp@@ s world@@ view is not represented by Peter B@@ h@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
B@@ h@@ atia and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours trying to watch the &quot; Phoenix &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr who struggles for her life on the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son .
she still fits in to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es which helped me to get used to the complexity of American life with a lot of patience and grace .
then there was Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise coun@@ sel helped me a lot during my career .
these people and those of them em@@ bodied my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp was his way to nom@@ inate republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to overlook these things , broke my heart .
maybe it is unfair to describe the Tru@@ mp voters as rac@@ ists .
to arrange the people , &quot; said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ capacity to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of which most are white , voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control of a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m . ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lifting of white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; word@@ play from white in reference to the White and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means so much like s@@ ling@@ erie , as it was the great Van Jones , has just killed what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have , America is always welcome .
for this country chose to be his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white America that promises to say and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole term of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the hel@@ m , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; brood the multitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Lat@@ inos have a seat in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; have A@@ fr@@ o Americans a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a consistent and sound@@ ing &apos; NE@@ XT &apos; !
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , &quot; said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music , which is played in both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among the tourists -@@ but worlds far from the nearby scenic ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for a couple of years , the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing a sym@@ ph@@ ony sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra which has found their musical instruments to overcome poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English Newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and ban@@ den @-@ violence .
but it changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , which started a musical project and the youth had thus offered a rare hop@@ el@@ essness .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , means the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , gl@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing a village , which is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ un@@ cion in Paraguay capital - on instruments that are made of recycl@@ ed waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the recycl@@ er under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez has started to transform parts of the crash into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , viol@@ ins , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sa@@ x@@ oph@@ ones , trumpet and percussion , which were all produced from the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ette and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local eco @-@ ologist and musician instructor of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , reminiscent of the early days :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them are not living together with their children .
that changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a made from waste generation .
today there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments made of play@@ back material and called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poorest people - like the people of C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully combat the illegal fishing industry
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reported on international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
re@@ publication is done as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
in West Africa , at that time it was known that this ship already had operated in li@@ fied waters of illegal fishing , before the other coast of Africa was looking for .
the East African countries were therefore dis@@ incl@@ ined and somewhat incl@@ ined to welcome a viol@@ ating of this species on their shores .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed rapidly against the ship . they stayed in it , one of their ports and refused to give him a fisher@@ man &apos;s own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply put everything in it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ man . he is part of a team that was discovered and followed the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , because of pill@@ age the fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fisheries ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that then had the Premier of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand for each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project provides support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is defined by definition : what is caught , is hidden , present because of it is extremely difficult to split doors . thus , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
through the inten@@ tional dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecosystems which have a delicate equilibrium .
but while actions against illegal fishing once were ham@@ per@@ ed by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the snow @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are occurring today in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there the individual countries can share or exchange lists of existing licenses for example , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that you noticed during a port review .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in bot@@ tled areas - such as susp@@ ects transit routes , such as such , that suggests that a ship invites its captured fish on the road to other ships .
in the ide@@ al@@ case , such surveys can show whether the ships involved have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly , whether they have a criminal spirits .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports on the basis of such information , meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to avoid sanctions , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leader director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a couns@@ elling company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the platform previously mentioned was created to regain 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i every year because of the illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing villages , present for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . under these same illegal fishermen .
for their practices , including actions as the sailing on false flag , fake lic@@ papers , indicating the fanta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fishing in reserves areas .
&quot; they consistently use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an incomplete , organised control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; earlier , a ship could become illegal fishing and a country could not say &quot; You dar@@ ed to run my harbour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ m to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal slip hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inception , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
it has uncovered crimes that had fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identities and found it volati@@ le ships and found .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over high distances and preserved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to instruc@@ t ships more precise .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be further developed , also helps to record the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and this is why we try to cross &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Che@@ f@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fishing data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be contracted by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects various information levels with each other . it is designed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO New Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the marine protection organization Oce@@ ana , the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch opened : a platform that can display satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of every single trac@@ e@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is where - this is simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel criminals , but also sc@@ are deter@@ red .
ships used to be conf@@ is@@ cated in the past without a license and have little to reck@@ on with consequences now , they now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i participated in the meantime a 33 % increase in fishing services that have since buy fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia has helped to record Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ nets , whose use is forbidden .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also have other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars per year disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are 2015 six countries together with so called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the goal to make even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s most recent member state was able to report to its first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that went under false flag . and not only was the ship used without license and were used tow@@ ing networks , which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated into bot@@ tled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time proving that such a particular , collaborative way to protect the oceans really works in the entire world @-@ sea .

the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are under protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ de Venezuela ( about : the reg@@ aining of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the land of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north @-@ north Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezuel@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of changing the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the post@@ ure of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .

on Twitter there are pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
very large waves beat the message over polished repression in the central north @-@ north of Marac@@ ay .
then the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect itself according to the police and armed forces of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral back , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country some prot@@ esters tried to stop the police forces , including those women in the An@@ de@@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear rub@@ b@@ aking , because one could see anything else what many nation@@ alists do not have !
meanwhile , it already makes a Info@@ graphic the round , which forms the scale of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minister@@ ial process - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many innumerable people on the streets .
my@@ te@@ ks Media Labs adds :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ Ã­ claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your minister@@ ial @-@ recovery !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has been doing little against the devast@@ ated economic crisis and in doing so has dealt with critical voices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more of frequency and intensity .
some Venezuel@@ ans reported the media , they are hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of a interviews with Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ inian message page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to join the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city CÃ³rdoba .
in the meantime , he said Qui@@ j@@ ano in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father .
in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden , to carry the same name as his father to the brutal sp@@ ears in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he watched at the age of 15 he has suffered enough .
34 years he held the family of trade for himself .
in the situation back then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated from his father .
at that time I could not realise that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ officials . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean Military Tribunal from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was in prison by 1976 until 1978 Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division 141 in La Per@@ la .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy in the course of the years , and who said before a federal tribunal against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the Sports Hall to the military base
when my father started to take care of the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had a young boy who made combat sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo , and urged me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an Ar@@ sh@@ ole , you have completed you with one of the ERP .

that is why he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had brought me up .
on the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Prop@@ ag@@ and@@ eli@@ ds , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ as the prisoners are tor@@ tured there
my dad took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time , he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ gain , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small into a blan@@ ket of pa@@ stry and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were thrown and signed me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
as the prisoners are tor@@ tured there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I pointed out and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on man .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attach it to one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body that was just there .
she rarely gets a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured them with water and said to him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the ridge there was in there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately again and told me it became clear that the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself , how is it possible that a man can do with another so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed . &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tivated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were able to tie .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indicted in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying with the face - they were all in hands and feet .
in the proximity of the entrance , people remain silent on the mattresses .
when my father re@@ marked that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you do so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
I answered , Why did you otherwise bring me ? &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were cast into a tomb and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms known as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there had a man together and killed there .
( according to the survivors of the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina were sentenced to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia leads to the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former fol@@ li@@ cles chambers .
the path that you came here is also the way in which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look on the map , see that they took about this way and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were given a number assigned to the process of de@@ human@@ ised .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that it should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; Eye @-@ mare &apos;
my father carried all sorts of stolen things at home .
back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war @-@ mare &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war @-@ mare is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs which one decreases an enemy that you have fought .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
once he called me a criminal , and I said , and you who put cars on the road ?
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and crying out :
if you go so far , then I will find you and trans@@ figured yourself .
we need nobody else to do so !
this was my father .
I have no one good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time when I was wearing a jacket and a sco@@ und@@ rel pul@@ lover . both my father had taken from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
back then , the Defence accused me to have been with this crime . I res@@ isted , no problem , they can lay myself to the burden what they wanted .
I was anyway there to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I find re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you have children only , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been ex@@ iled during the dictatorship of Man , but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children take part ?
one day my father brought a girl with his mother , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply been able to put it into prison .
I reck@@ on it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom you could hand their mortal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they removed machines to eliminate the mortal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were sm@@ ashed and somewhere de@@ ple@@ te - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something of course still remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought to view my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I did not know him for all the atrocities that I had to experience at all times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not know . I have not killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt war@@ dly dead and asked me , why the whole exaggerated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian sentim@@ ents , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were really good .
then , I called :
how can you tell a thing about me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child .
he res@@ isted only &quot; Na then put me on . &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I restore the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can pres@@ cribe me that I am pre@@ taken . I finally have said against my own father .

the jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the proportions of the judgment .
after four years , more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera ended in August 1975 and December 1978 crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 j@@ op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty for crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the Court imposed in 28 cases of life detention and in nine cases pen@@ alties between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was Fre@@ is@@ audi@@ ble .
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder , torture and rape by forces . # Es@@ war@@ ster@@ ism
all def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military personnel , former police team members and civil workers .
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the Swiss chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ humane heads .
the Court judgement is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 founded Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represent the children of men who were murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government was located on the country La Per@@ la , so that a memorial was built there , which is now managed by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; an translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driving license , in the last month , witnesses of a very un@@ ass@@ aul@@ ted translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistak@@ enly - maybe also with BÃ¶@@ sem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was available from 1 to 20 September on electronic display in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in social media .
the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a local citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who attentive the local newspapers .
the Kyoto newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the reasonable case , although grammar is not quite correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in Kyoto ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the bug had already been included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation has not been tested on its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) in our part , &quot; said the Police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News was more exec@@ utable with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police there are the proportion of older motor@@ ists involved , who are involved in accidents , but quite cause for concern .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 was caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
so , her share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents decreased in total , the proportion of accidents caused in the same period has risen in the same period .
the name not mentioned re@@ porter was able to show comments on the light published on Yahoo announced , which prejudices some Japanese seems to be against older motor@@ ists :
the article on Yahoo reports on the translation errors , among other things , received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) does not mean the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So is not the translation at all or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not find that this is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in whole Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and all Asia .
the site En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true fund@@ raising for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
thank@@ fully , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native language . in general , the conviction that translators is in the target language - not in the source language - native language should be .
for example , a French mother language should translate as an example from English to French - not from French to English .
photo by Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue that could make translations into English . this may lack of lack of understanding , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies who do not have foreign employees , let translations still be in company @-@ internal . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best , for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases that arise by machine translation , show that this technique cannot replace a long one human translator . this applies especially to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used by T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or not understood .
photo by Flickr @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may seem as jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect careful translations .
the city is hopefully to use a reputable source of its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors in the Internet and on TV
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Adventure ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7th , Venezuel@@ an Internet users took no access to the online Sender Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV is no longer accessible .
also other online transm@@ itter recordings of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists groups who oppose the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro@@ s government .
the protests were started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court was dissolved , and the duties of the Parliament was transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was closed , and recommended the U@@ sers to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it appears that Internet pages ven@@ an American Provider are again locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezuel@@ ans with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ating for protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission was threatened by tele@@ com@@ s with fin@@ es and closing arguments if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission saw it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call to violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that the continues to be cheaper than buying two lit@@ res of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ in@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also concerns the Internet site , where the National Assembly transfers their meetings .
previous research surveys by the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had sur@@ rendered to use the local Internet provider to use DNS . this is a technique , through which the DNA @-@ server requests of certain domains are faul@@ ty .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flores , which over@@ took the protest in Caracas .
Flores was kno@@ cked out , while he was in a police force .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went over again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government is reported to regulate the Internet connections : thus the Venezuel@@ ans will gain access to multi @-@ media coverage over current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls will go to slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects them from other Cri@@ adi@@ ans who were just how they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of cur@@ t@@ tural and published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ uel@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not living together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house spoke full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ c , one calls in Paraguay up more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money handed out their inf@@ erior son or her under@@ age daughter to another , plentiful family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned above is that children can do countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these practices described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ mean az@@ go - gathered testimonies , researched and p@@ ran@@ ged .
she tried to call things in name because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated against the Cri@@ adi@@ ta , is guaranteed to be silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one hand the family that gave her daughter to faith that she could complete their training , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family that took the girl in itself and justi@@ fies the exploitation with the faith that there would give a chance to anyone who would otherwise have no education , and maybe even star@@ ving .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mist@@ ook her family will experience only many years later .
sometimes they never know of them .
in January 2016 the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of par@@ agu@@ an households , but a face .
as Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº came into hospital her body showed traces of violent stro@@ kes . in short , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official in the residence .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck together with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered deadly injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep @-@ rooted practice of the Cri@@ mean az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ mean az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest leaders and demanded that there should be no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of adul@@ ter@@ ars and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a faster investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case is brought before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n will be indic@@ ative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ado az@@ go is to be brought before .
everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ming where her father worked , his course had to register and her father lost his job .
their brothers had to go all work and started to sell on the street or on the sweets market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , they had to split the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood up every morning at 5 pm and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Friday for example clean@@ se the fridge , p@@ utz@@ lig@@ ned the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ in@@ fied the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time for learning .
the sooner they finish with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says it had never been hungry , but did not get any kind of food . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the refrigerator , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some dig@@ ging the land@@ lady Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand beside him and editorial from opposition periods like &quot; Sen@@ dero , &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; to read .
he tried to convince them that reports of the official media have no faith about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held them for intelligent , but did not work with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who listened to while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guaran@@ i , at home again her native Re@@ Ã­ .
their Lord feared that they had made it possible to lose them , she declares .
but she was fully aware that she got for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing that is almost never talked about , are har@@ ass@@ ment and the har@@ sh@@ arks of which Cri@@ adi@@ ta are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ adi@@ ta is .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to go home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships emerge , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of a group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company is cheap the Cri@@ mean az@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where there can be vac@@ an@@ cies for cleaning agents and children &apos;s cities in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the As@@ un@@ cion district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please log in .
start from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad was given five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a miserable girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the state inner that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the course of our history we have managed systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to be subjected to slaves and to their &quot; wives . &quot; therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys come into a system of slavery in which they become easy victim to abuse and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social inequality in Paraguay and those to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bill is writing Egyptian users social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently agreed to a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the use and usefulness of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is adopted by the Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law would then be set up in a position to give citizens a permission to grant social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of accepting the law , users and users should register on the site of the site with their correct name and recruitment numbers to use social networks .
will it be dre@@ aming of doing this , so it might bring a penalty up to six months in jail or a fin@@ ches .
the bill , consisting of six plots and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs through the internet and used to communicate with other means of voice , vide@@ on@@ ach@@ ments and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities want to impose upon the registration of the Egyptian authorities and users who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media company .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians and Pat@@ rons of the Law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received from the telecommunications Department a username and a password to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to set a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Leader &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things which have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they pretend that just as they have violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously then this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must be discussed at the legislative and constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that no devi@@ ations of scar@@ ves are present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the Parli@@ ament@@ ary Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal situation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a lifel@@ ong sentence for those provided for guilty that thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan area in the north @-@ east of Iraq , protecting animal welfare H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the gh@@ ost Persian leop@@ ards .
one sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which walks through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are always less prey .
why is this particular kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
how R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ ors in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a large predat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards in the wild wild is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a big cat at the camera , R@@ aza breaks in pure pleasure .
being educated , he passion@@ ately passionate about a different side of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict .

in early March 2017 , documented in the nor@@ theastern Japan daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the past six years to re @-@ establish the life of those who had been hit by the &quot; Trinity catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fukus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , situated in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a et@@ art@@ ed pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring towns of Fukus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all the coastal cities van@@ ished from the map .
for this , the pre@@ fecture of Fukus@@ hima still lived a nuclear accident , already for that reason , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report from the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o reports from local perspective , which has been achieved after six years of age in order to re @-@ establish the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ construct as well as pol@@ l results of those affected themselves .
residential construction in Fukus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( of course , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fukus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could deliver Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses while at Fukus@@ hima , with 70 per cent the final light .
however , one still endeav@@ ours to continue to settle for six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated of homes ( s ) , cas@@ et@@ it@@ su Ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final sub@@ stitutes .
after the thre@@ e@@ fold disaster nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 more and more than 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated coming from Fukus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emergency shel@@ ters . over 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated settlements , which were conquered by disaster in homes , were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ fec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by un@@ happiness , have opened their doors up to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during nearly 100 percent of the fishing industry in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again , at Fukus@@ hima only 30 percent of fisheries have res@@ umed their operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have moved into compassion in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land .
over 93 percent of its agricultural areas , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fukus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear issue , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukus@@ hima lying in the &quot; nuclear wave &quot; zone .
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures the tourism re @-@ rest@@ art@@ ed again , but also here at Fukus@@ hima remains far off .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are once again 90 percent on the same stand as in front of the disaster . however , Fukus@@ hima , however , can only be 75 per cent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is harder to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine a total picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the native population and under the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how its feeling has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done .
as it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fukus@@ hima
in their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has reinforced its attention to the position of the evacu@@ ated of Fukus@@ hima .
in Fukus@@ hima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fukus@@ hima was also witn@@ essing the worst , catastrop@@ hic , atomic accident , the Japan ever had to experience .
from 160 000 evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima nearly 63 000 people were moved out of areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fukus@@ hima , have been settled in permanent sub@@ stitutes .
after 2017 , still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukus@@ hima still live outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated areas are most of the evacu@@ ated shel@@ ters , older than 50 years old . you must re@@ tire right away because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people encounter people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater than the common@@ alities .
after a while , however , one re@@ alizes that one more links than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is still very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat subjects that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond voice and country boundaries .

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 were delivered this week : last Friday , a police officer took him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a perc@@ ussions against the head . nationwide , millions of prot@@ esters participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors made him Saturday this Saturday and have now moved him into a artificial coma .
its condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which is rapidly spread throughout a few days rapidly in Brazil .
on the pictures also the face of the police officer should be recognized , which took with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s were known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o has been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident has been suspended by the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he defeats in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his perc@@ ussions at the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer would be insp@@ ected by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be six months in television to see and all the oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of Media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video on the net by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several param@@ edic shortly afterwards to him .
another video with the same scenes , filmed from a different perspective is also filmed in social networks .
in the clip shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brasi@@ lian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) , to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to make his family , in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he has been occupying the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the Occup@@ y Movement at Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police station , having been attacked by a polic@@ emen who threw him with a stroke .
police @-@ gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police officers on prot@@ esters last Friday .
polic@@ emen sat in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where they built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ oun@@ ce violence against demonstrators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street protests tolerated , by focusing on a different , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported a cru@@ mb@@ ling glass windows in order to illustrate a photo of their front pages illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o fav@@ ored a title story with a fire set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window @-@ screen than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a particular thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also necessary to acknowledge that if you are strictly against any form of def@@ ective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here also the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate importance , and the typical violence of the military police are pregnant with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on the confrontation with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of de@@ fle@@ es forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar mills were closed across Cuba the doors ( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - irrespective of that there is no appreci@@ able sugar @-@ harvest on site .
it is two years ago , when the activities were put in the sugar mills .
according to the decre@@ es , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and according to its installations , until only the smells of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 2@@ 72 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent itself .
some are rarely the work .
other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and com@@ mu@@ ters daily to the factories , which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veteran , who runs every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry won &apos;t be his sleep .
he heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar factories that are in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were preserved .
it was something which he was not expecting .
N@@ ene recalls that exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ as I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise has not been held .
the sugar cane industry already res@@ isted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the poor management of administration and climate change .
by 2016 , the production was 1.@@ 6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for alarm for the country some decades , but the bad harvest is no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway sti@@ ff of the church saw better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar @-@ factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs led to such actions were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 until 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain per pound according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agricultural &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the raw export level would provide about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar cane brands , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the be@@ et factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
when N@@ ene , as it is known as a soldier , is known about the closing of the factory , is the word he repeated most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place they formed a full time - working group .
before the first closure of the year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents that would only be removed in respect of the parts which would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , but the minister was able to approve any decision .
from there the responsibility was handed over and the letters were always more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the nursing factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money in operation for the sugar factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was opposed to his will at the lac@@ tation of the factory when building it helped .
with every part he removed , disman@@ tled one of his 31 labor years .
the best developed industry area of Cuba and more important work@@ ings was er@@ ased .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for working and services that generated the plants in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the atten@@ dant people saw , when he guaranteed that for the areas , their factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar factories .
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly through M@@ ole .

after two years , the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane &apos;s factory closed , or better said than they began to rot@@ ate them , they also listened to asphal@@ ted the road , this cur@@ tails also other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they were made to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people also left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis de Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ und@@ und@@ four@@ ths bring the old soldiers an ann@@ u@@ ity of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .

first Nations young people use Hi@@ p Hop to express themselves and get their own culture
inclusion of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
youth of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with subjects that are important for them . they are doing so through Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour we have launched a workshop leader mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers , to teach youth groups of song@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- , video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were headed by the Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions about such as &quot; cultural identity , language , discussion , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes up in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the territory of the trunk of the kite environment , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway for tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen young women were usually van@@ ished or murdered .
the cases were largely ignored .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the conservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youngsters are not always master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation received , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop Group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is at your disposal the St@@ anz@@ he in re@@ writing , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day when you get our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and move forward as our youth
so they can do what they determined the Creator .
in the commentary letter , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the verses in Sil@@ en@@ script ( which is also published on his blog ) :

in Japan you can see plastic courts before almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are being exhibited near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ i@@ ri@@ u ( this is where the plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) issued by any food , which is served in this restaurant .
the customers look at these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Great &apos;s district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small companies that produce just those plastic courts , which was documented by the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even perceive them once more . however , a new trend is turned into show@@ y cell accessories and other gadgets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ y@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic geri@@ ded mobile phones , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y objects , as in this case , cooling cabinet magne@@ ts :
here are a few sho@@ ddy refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is increasingly complex .
in this case a ca@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) was turned into a cell @-@ edges .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone @-@ stands .
we also have made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that records your mobile phone :
designed to see like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the funny .
some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen uses , a popular game that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there any one who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can use my mobile with salmon @-@ ro@@ gens ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe , I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also accept a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our newest mobile phone @-@ edges has the shape of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and Hand@@ y@@ tapes from dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be viewed under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # are the ones in the board included .
if you would like to know more about the origins of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the borough of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi ( K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi ) .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic courts have actually been produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of foreign and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the mist@@ ru@@ sts and transmis@@ sions regularly dive only in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy which brings this battle with itself at all .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ell , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ n , or on the con@@ greg@@ ations that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ pse , behind any frac@@ ture in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories payable parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never heal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ el@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with drug trading experiences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and telling stories of people who , in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime does not only allow us to be afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and all churches have to ride many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives changed &quot; ) tells precisely these stories .
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is seeking a weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost their father in just one day , their four si@@ blings , their husband and two of their ne@@ phe@@ ws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing ourselves again to the task of looking for us , go ahead and to graves after the people we loved to look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but they do not get paid off because they demand a star@@ vation .
where should we get ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co , &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we have to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state management .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be seen as normal , regardless of what shape they are occurring :
I &apos;ve been familiar with illness and sensation of journ@@ alism for some years now .
I &apos;m passing every day at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with images , which can actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from the acquisition of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider it normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me that is , as if they stra@@ ined those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness if stories are to mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbor could be justified , that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recep@@ tionist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to talk about that they will remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico @-@ Stadt wrote the contribution of &quot; four months black@@ mailing in the main town . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals take money from their business , until they end up not only the business , but also their family had been torn apart .
you think of everything you got lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain above never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high when you &apos;re alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed from each other , the better .
it included their report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked myself in these terrible days if tears would dis@@ solve my deep feelings , but the reply is no , because I forgot how one crying . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation of violence known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of her .
Br@@ yan is a commodity and he tells that he himself had to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water , sugar and dairy powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant as compared to the pain in his eyes - Un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life of violence exists and that had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez saw this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez in 2006 .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murder according to the State of Civil Rights and the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ secutor tried 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ de per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of thousands who leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of always new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we may not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; the data journ@@ alism project called Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to raise the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ tured the country over the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages to which he linked , contain images , on which violence is shown .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment in which it &apos;s about to raise a ru@@ mor or de@@ for@@ gery .
but how is the years after something the first time has appeared ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication it was mis@@ led to make trage@@ dies which actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there are abundant reporting of events in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a pet@@ rol rac@@ ed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ ed and explo@@ ded . there were 230 people killed .
after the civil war , Africa had been far neglected country for years , and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became a dangerous paths of stri@@ ls who were difficult to drive .
past@@ ors fell victim to that of the pet@@ rol wag@@ ons .
official representatives described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ lig@@ ated houses , including a cinema nearby , which was full of people who illustr@@ ating the football stadium .
houses shed and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses were disper@@ sed in the streets .
many people were burned to the uni@@ formity .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ multi@@ ere photos of the incident form the gray @-@ full scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of cro@@ oked body that are placed on the ground while individuals are looking at .
but here history is not its end .
over the years the same picture was recorded and fal@@ si@@ fied several times in social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to the trage@@ dies in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the escaped from B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically from atrocities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse plants in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the following @-@ time images could be exemplary .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army @-@ based point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to attract B@@ oko Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture came back from the Democratic Republic of Congo , when it was presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
in fact , this abuse of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ representations ; Africa Check has documented an orders to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the image was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments , such as this example , conf@@ essed the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge came in touch with the deadly persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee bats , rape and several deaths , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following that these descriptions have brought together with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo :
this picture comes from an acid @-@ Arabic news page , which was mis@@ diagnosed in 2012 , the president of the mar@@ s Th@@ an being said , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo to make this information .
the original comment , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations , the AF@@ P as their source , had also mistak@@ enly called Th@@ an being this statement , but had not associated with it the image of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false coupling range to date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turned image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a combination of private pages , platforms of social media and community , as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed away false reports , others have tried to infl@@ ate the f@@ akes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have identified examples for the ab@@ used usage and linked them to the respective countries on which side they have been published . thus , we want to be more clearly more clearly defined than by the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which were linked in some cases also ) several examples of mis@@ cellaneous use date .
here are some cases which can now be fully split ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
offer examples of false Cou@@ pl@@ ings of the Democratic Republic of Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange resi@@ ded countries indicate on pages or servers , which are still available on the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or counterf@@ eit messages .
the countries in Gray are examples , which are according to met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , are probably also fake examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

even within Nigeria , the photo taken from the Democratic Republic of Congo became a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion region .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of a mis@@ sive use of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo , using a twe@@ et , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ erian attacks , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are pro@@ secuted , too deli@@ gi@@ timi@@ dly , since the photos of these were mis@@ used .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the government of Myanmar released a re@@ mind@@ set of what they considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately fin@@ alised news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments came to create mis@@ understandings regarding Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this reef , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to make that Muslims kill Buddh@@ ists and their other rum ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which was directed to the members of the Russian orthodox community , is clear that the Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic of Congo does not show Muslims the Christians kill .
Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page was alleged that the President of Myanmar was implic@@ ated in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image from San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to contain .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 over students , who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , has expressly stated that the image is not derived from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to with@@ stand that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ok@@ y@@ or@@ thin &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and extingu@@ ished a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ acres of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were taking these events , the mut@@ u@@ ity in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was clo@@ cked as proof of the mass@@ acres of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 Male ret@@ we@@ ed ) . but the messages that were associated with it were attacked in no religious context .
instead , the target was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre , in circulation , over@@ threw discussions like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to the false message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the Embassy in which the picture was contained from the Democratic Republic of Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ inians Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also shows , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / data stamp exist on the web@@ s and have isolated it in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only significantly after the original un@@ back of 2010 , the image eventually carries a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that move these Po@@ sts . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence regarding the silence of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the slogan of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Buddh@@ ists .
a second fro@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is under@@ rated as a comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question however is what happens when readers do not have any longer belief in these pictures .
with social media , there are poor people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of the mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ city did un@@ true and fl@@ us@@ ks it the real atro@@ phy of what actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that returning from images of ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , concern that violent images and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ tise and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example this study , investig@@ ating how violent media work to help others ) .
while there are some talk about violent representations in the news media , fact , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists experiment , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News , &quot; you &apos;ll have to thoroughly think about situation in which a picture is sug@@ ary , which actually does not actually be used from the context or on completely mis@@ cellaneous species .
any investigation of false subsidies should also take into consideration how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Sim@@ mons uses in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( eg . un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable ) makes every effort to offer language avi@@ d a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all translate .
there are words in each language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese su@@ ck ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all with@@ stand stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly at any attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a slightly different context is needed to understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the VAT language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :

how Sri Lanka is approaching the worst flood of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and dr@@ astic disaster in this decade .
triggered by mon@@ soon , who normally uses at the end of May , are by strong rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and Schl@@ amm@@ ers .
more than 400 000 people have been hit ( 26 May ) since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought into 30@@ 4 secure locations .
the rainf@@ alls were on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water conditions in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene standards represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water @-@ distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ s and Sri Lanka twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the high water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , warns Save the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded because of the yesterday &apos;s down@@ cast water lack of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has five planes for b@@ ail@@ outs made available and another five are made for transport of not@@ ches for those made in its flooded villages included .
also various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also explained to help .
Facebook pages like Help F@@ lood Vic@@ er in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue operations need threats to their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry foods and life @-@ needed goods for flood @-@ offerings -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 7@@ 4@@ 49@@ 7@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 to if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) ask for people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ tery centre will be informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pical Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button which allows users to invo@@ ke a vehicle for re@@ conditioning of assistance and donations . they were then rel@@ ayed for free to the Sri Lan@@ kan Red Cross .
likewise , they conducted a &quot; SOS &quot; button which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat reactions to result by floods and dr@@ ut@@ ches carried into fir@@ mer people .
the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where multiple social media platforms are fully exploited , people in distress bring people into security and provide assistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use approved by .@@ Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear girlfriend .
I trust my four year old daughter , they trust me their children ; she is my rock in the deser@@ tification .
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next leg , we are rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are located in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ ache , bound by a American flag , other sk@@ an@@ ed slo@@ gans against anti @-@ hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because I am not mus@@ li@@ a ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; which built themselves in their imagination .
they sanc@@ ti@@ ze me .
there are around 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
we identify with it to be Muslim but to different species but somehow we all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , those as I do not fit there , be Muslim .
to be Muslim
I am not alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry in America is selling is : Rum@@ i .
which images do you come to mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodox Muslim and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western thought , religion was removed , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the anti @-@ induc@@ tion@@ istic pictures of Muslims , the Western books have been colon@@ ised for centuries .
this temp@@ ting speech is determined by the dark man that one should fear and the exotic woman one should save .
the Norwegian Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid displaced the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images also rise further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues to stand .
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ atives dom@@ inate our News@@ fe@@ eds .
this fool o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed the reality that have led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this scar fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are har@@ assed because of her head blan@@ ket in public buildings and to cover su@@ di Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong fol@@ ly weak@@ ened Muslim women , which lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken by African Americans who were brought together with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this fool has our collective imagination as deep and fla@@ wed , that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children are becoming the target of tim@@ us@@ li@@ ous attacks and ra@@ ids .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the manner in which we tell them , Islam@@ ophobia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives , which help us understand the world .
and my industry had failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed to find out where seven million Muslims constitute the highest level of &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the total Muslim population are African American @-@ American Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants in the first generation coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my invited parents met in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ er Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan imagined the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were indign@@ ant for Muslims and Americans .
but am I now f@@ aded Mus@@ lim@@ a and Americ@@ anism ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k , I say - instead of bringing my Muslim recipes or bring my hand@@ craft to all Muslims - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ kes , we do not carry all flas@@ h@@ ans with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for extra safety checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widely spread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ captured Islam@@ ophobia machinery , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for Fal@@ co @-@ information that is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and due to the nature in which we tell them , Islam hos@@ tility is more than just a stranger who eats the head blan@@ ket .
or as the sho@@ cking map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ ophobia in its ugly forms acc@@ esses our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity that is so versatile , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer .

use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Muslim was born then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor could see my neighbor in the surf that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when she could look through the 15 metre concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the omni@@ present ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms and her the Arabic verses for the protection of the Koran , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith may not always be visible but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .
the grandmother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the picture of my grandmother maternal part with her sisters , as they win a contest of the art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment , when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings , and un@@ finished paintings , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that can easily mem@@ ori@@ ze them .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to be the prayers they had told me if I have a bad day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim is to be as she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a people who was founded over the centuries - through an &quot; Empire &quot; colony , founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ company , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow and listen to that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my own grandfather cri@@ es .
in the middle of France , while he writes books about the modern Islam and about the independence of Kash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ eping around his family in India , Kash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close to his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , from coloni@@ alists have been torn apart , who have shared the Muslim world as in the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans are all right up to four Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first fli@@ ers of history was rejected by a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , a Indian , Kash@@ mir of the British Empire , was referred to by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England .
even before the aircraft , he jour@@ ne@@ yed to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people go deeply into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ kn@@ itted story .
it means to remind that fourteen years ago the most powerful military of the world , with troops being distributed across every continent apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , were gone to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the rub@@ ble of the war .
an American Muslim means to know that the su@@ icide demand among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy goes back the US and the susp@@ ects has a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white attacks .
it means to know that four ten years ago the first prayer vocation , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name image .
it means to know that two hundred years ago a African Islamic @-@ headed by called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim .
it is the hope I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a mus@@ li@@ abi and a journalist , signi@@ fied in@@ dur@@ ous inter@@ sec@@ tional identities of our with multi@@ ples bonds , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.@@ 7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reduced branches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build upon this branch of structural Islam@@ ism .
structural Islam@@ ophobia is based in the Muslim registr@@ ars that began with President Bush and re@@ inv@@ aded President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she consists in the immigration office , which takes five years old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just countries that are being bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs which we ab@@ stain from Muslim countries .
because of the stories that we tell and because of those who do not tell us , we are here today .
in a study titled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants presented a scientifically un@@ correct picture and have them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 on evolution .
Muslims received the sli@@ ghtest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we need to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep dar@@ ling to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ate the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous figur@@ ative prints that we stand in our Newsletter .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our of@@ ed identities and forget history often .
the Pod@@ cast See , S@@ ay Island of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim ; S@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ically , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots from media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of my American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global time , in which we are located .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason for conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now entering the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not been given them yet ; now they dominate big areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the realities and history of which I was not aware of when I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but who today made me a must @-@ bound Mus@@ lim@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
things I left behind here as a bread@@ cru@@ mp@@ track in my speech .
things that may aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections , which makes our humanity constitutes a story , where someone is being made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation took place at the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw at our schools or which we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why should I tell you this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are being w@@ aged and given people through the creation of the &quot; Other &quot; in public presentation , four decades ago was a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of what my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president , the chocolate cake spe@@ c while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; among others &quot; people bom@@ bed , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ co@@ art wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ ellers , by Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an opportunity to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the telling of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ super@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the spoken word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite such small languages are not passed on to the children .
the project is valid for the creators of the project :
the mass mortality in the world can be avoided when we create cities which accept di@@ ac@@ ces - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be listened to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening is often linked to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the listening to estimate , feel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story first in their own language and then translate them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and the presentation lead to that the audiences can be pushed forward .
they call forth laughter and emotions that the language would no longer be a barrier .
the following video illustrates for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou were also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative for their land typical of the narrative of the narrative .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the Pavi@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
having explained the importance of his tale , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ ins he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness :
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...
you were all with me !
up to date , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand it . all that are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States &apos; re @-@ determination of the sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which lasted for 72 million US dollars , participated in the past 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass rally ; the march started at the pu@@ ert@@ orian Capit@@ ol , the Government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old city of San Ju@@ ans .
she was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizens for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and of the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church meeting Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advocates of debt recognition of debts also submitted a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people Puerto Ric@@ os calls for politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies who are responsible for debts for their corrupt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for financial examination and a committee committee without personal interest in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions with appropriate re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which operates in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are er@@ pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our profitability will not be deduc@@ ted with decl@@ ining pension .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state @-@ consoli@@ dating of the USA - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
the measures imposed on the outside without the participation and conviction of the citizens are at risk to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration took the name &quot; Nach@@ tw@@ ache for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

artists and writers appreciate the work of the missing Syrian developer &apos;s Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi

the Sy@@ r@@ isch @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missed since more than one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has made for an open grid .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture , which is organized in Berlin , devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ner , manager of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house carried out by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; made books within three to five days , las@@ en excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ qu@@ ets ( The costs of freedom : a collective post@@ research ) .
the book that has been published last year and has been available for license , contains a number of sets that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to ba@@ it and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked side by side to look over the fog who surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense out of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been de@@ tained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted from the Y@@ dra prison directory in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information on his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that urge for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us can start thinking about their own destiny , actions and decisions .
why are we today here ?
what have we decided ?
what have we abandoned with extreme convic@@ tions in this process ?
the web development for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , transferred to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer of N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel was based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Tribunal of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as in@@ sider of the Assad government and took notice of a alleged death row against their husband .
its length of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively participated in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded in Bas@@ sel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes are pres@@ cient as the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cru@@ iser of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture @-@ types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would all put on it , this architecture , which em@@ bodied not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a period of time that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bas@@ sel was not able to complete this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and ba@@ it taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English , even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he always has shared his knowledge with any he asked ; he has taught other incar@@ cer@@ ated teaching English to write and speak .
Bas@@ sel has opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me to the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without having in fact held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi also is the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ it ) , a rehearsal which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a long time .
they smug@@ gled the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them from the Arab to English .
the book is license @-@ free available .
accounting from Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; There is happening &quot; :
it is happening with every visit ,
that I vers@@ ed in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace ,
that any of the dangers does not matter ,
everyone of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and watch@@ man
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with myself ,
if your eyes will tell you well
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ eliness ,
to take back all the moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I overwhelmed myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year passes , my soul
while
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died in custody for at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans since 2011 .
the stories of many more people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel for 2012 .

Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption def@@ endant director after ports of prison returned to previous post
Mos@@ ambique responded with anger to a corrupt fall , where a government member returned home after half his sentence in the state apparatus at which the corruption was committed .
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 Euro ) for 22 years imprisonment .
the money was from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately demanded his re @-@ recruitment into the company , which was then in April 19 then .
in accordance with an opinion of the General Public Pro@@ secutor of the Republic , who exp@@ elled the request , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ ba@@ za again to refer to his old post since the company had no discipline proceedings after his custody .
however , many people did not do the action well .
the Center for Public Health ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ blica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution that advocates the public transparency in an interview with the Deutsche Welle making the decision of the company to restore the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note of is that also the company should have a discipline proceedings against the viol@@ in@@ ist .
however , the company apparent , however , prompted no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour also and considers the case as &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent guy , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them have fallen .
he could hold well @-@ paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and record his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to become re@@ integrated into the company that he helped cause damage .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of policy science in Brazil says the director had no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state , because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded by someone that is so massive with the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it has served itself only by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a handful of money source and the state itself became we@@ ary of this man who was charged and eventually condemned to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mos@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only to be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp , inter@@ sec@@ ting and - incidentally - prophe@@ tic redund@@ ant .
one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was , when he confirmed energetic that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , also the father@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora said also : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he does not change tactics but he does not turn from his ambitions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ambitious man is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also back@@ end :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat for 10 years and came free .

Facebook blocked the racial word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means Ki@@ ck@@ pe@@ a or a split . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network recorded their posts from the net , because they presented the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to human @-@ Indian origin , or generally used as an ad@@ jective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or where the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be used as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma into the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of a nationalist @-@ nationalist mo@@ tions of the word has given an extremely abnormal con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word which is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on his platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may still be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically call hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts in which they have reviewed the use of the word or have doubts to be expressed in the purpose of their use .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ical words with the different meanings , which have the same letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written at Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( verb ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ used A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they knew how he could soo@@ the his back pain by making a word game .
the proposition ku la - &quot; curing &quot; ( ku ) + the fra@@ il ( la ) at Bur@@ m@@ ically - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ es is the opinion that she also l@@ essen the language of hate speech , but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytical before all posts def@@ aults in suspicion , racism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you write on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyse the post and check it by checking the next words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ tine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists are spreading the hate speech , receiving a pretty good lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is time to cur@@ b their nationalism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the action may send a strong signal to all the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat demonstrated that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often become a cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts as he only wanted to share his friends saying that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is ban@@ ished :
... when I was attentive to this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends , that the word is locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; iron@@ ically , my post by Facebook was removed and I was forbidden to share the light , post and parts of content for 24 hours because the Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards did not fail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to demonstrate their opinions against hate @-@ hate speech .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech by Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are poor .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform but it does not work .
cens@@ or@@ ing such words will only bring more hate within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and so words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the counterf@@ eit Po@@ sts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefit of them , which compl@@ ained to them a great turnover , would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has provided for a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make use of Facebook funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook posts that have no hate language , but still removed :

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch her@@ curr@@ ent@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out whether Facebook removes the mail which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot , used with permission .
in the last five years extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists are increasing to the social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks play the violence in Myanmar , in addition to heating , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine where conflicts between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure , critic@@ ised the liber@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides under control .
but instead of argu@@ ing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would be better to focus more on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the child &apos;s deer
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the deer @-@ marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament &apos;s parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law that aims to ban this practice so that the disabled could now be at 18 .
prior to this change of the adul@@ tery , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities were arrested in practice , and in May 2016 , Bro@@ ker@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group called representatives of the different religious groups of the country , that the state cannot interfere with , as that , at the age of not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner for the UN children &apos;s rights prevention , which is defined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; min@@ ors under 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the year 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children suffering from 15 were already married , in Trinidad and Tobago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the statisti@@ c of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that tried to prevent the laws of child marriage , followed at the foot and pleasing to great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u @-@ leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they ought to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition , causing tensions in this actually in@@ complicated thing , and at some point the doubts came upon whether the opposition would not agree with the bill of law .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who enth@@ used himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the President of the country has to agree and declare the law to it .
one of the leaders of the country gave us a status update on Facebook which wrote the Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s deer was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not decided against it .
after having decided previously in the Senate , the draft will now become a law .
the majority of the social media users was enthusiastic , because the laws were finally changed to the children &apos;s before .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who is a minister in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has vei@@ led the core of the matter , but know what ? the children &apos;s deer is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago for now , and this is almost worth every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson of opinion was , it definitely took long enough to prevent the practice , Lara Qu@@ eb@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status @-@ Update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Excellent news !
the Act has been agreed .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ INA@@ D ) , a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law is noted :
the mar@@ ry age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious confes@@ sion of 18 years .
the draft to change the Act has been approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the MEPs who were agreed , voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mono@@ gam@@ y is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ birth .
many thanks to all activists who have dealt with him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our members .
yet a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Island Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
a few months ago , Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to undertake legal steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to be a promise now .
while the general pro@@ secutor of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj would act against the law , wished the most social media users , one would approach the debate in a different way .
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that can only talk about the issue that the state , our daughters of it protects that it may be of great , hard @-@ minded men that are ab@@ used to them , &quot; would you be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
yet whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s deer are legal or further the norm , although there are laws that they say .

although many advanced Internet users have used it , re@@ use tools for blocking websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date articles from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been un@@ locked in 2008 by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the internet has been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain closed , now several Mir@@ ror pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan File System ) , as the platform placed all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( so calcul@@ ator machines ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus making a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is retri@@ ev@@ able despite legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ gger post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
having heard the news ( about the block of Wikipedia ) , we set all of it to dis@@ locate Sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed ways .
this may help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org .
IP@@ FS was also mentioned that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .

a Nep@@ alese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation .

used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he looked around around , never satisfied . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motives and washed colours .
the motivated itself has a camera to bear in itself and try to understand the situation .
at that time he was a kid .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is trying to bring itself to the international scene as a wildlife .
and his hometown directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which direct the attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook , as it helps him this first @-@ class position in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Nav@@ ar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a leop@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kn@@ it pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to achieve global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deepen the understanding of the fact that wild animals are not as fear@@ ful as they look .
and he should know it , because he was already standing on his face to face .
one tiger is not bothered by the opinion of the sheep not in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was at home because of darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ ffer appeared . he immediately begins to see ourselves and he rest@@ led me through the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I clicked for the environment ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ as nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent to make in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds that live near the tourist arri@@ vals .
take a look at some of these photos below .

last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a sk@@ il@@ ance and rejected by her family and the village community , having responded to a close relatives with names .
the tradition of wives also does not name their wives , is also circul@@ ated among men . however , they have far less accessibility to fear , if at all , they should not return to this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , joined nine women , including health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and became quick to the main table of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of patri@@ archy .
being one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and advocates the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the exposure of practices , such as child labour up to the ex@@ i@@ ation of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS Indians , and guides these clubs .
it reports how these clubs are created for a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them both amb@@ ass@@ adors of the change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini presented in its panel , acted by women who do not name their hus@@ bands .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to talk the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify .
speaking the name of their hus@@ bands is not loud utter@@ ance , a Br@@ it is also capable of perpet@@ u@@ sive and never put it into question .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition shows that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this , is seen as a rear , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion about this discussion .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband by name , tried to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband stal@@ ks long after the video was finished .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name him from now on with his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started her first discussion board .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some felt that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected .
at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video@@ projection , the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini , each participant asked the name of her husband with different feelings to say - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then they asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they may call us how they want it means that they do not respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women are married for 30 years , and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ h in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra via the Bre@@ ak of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never speak their hus@@ bands &apos; name .
Roh@@ ini says :
a woman was so shy that she had ki@@ cked her during the whole exercise only before him ; another chose to let the whole squ@@ ander@@ ing frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in ad@@ renalin rush about it , having an ancient Br@@ ings broke out , the women decided that they were actually trying at home to call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they held their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into his head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member chose to do it during dinner prior to the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law she was fri@@ ghtened , she got afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding , and the situation ar@@ isen in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red spot on the forehead , which indicates the mar@@ ital status :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he also took it .
he laughs only and I listened to him to wear it .
the other women have not stopped working completely , but think they are in a better position , even to choose not to bear it in some days .
for many women the discussion board is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will take a trip at each discussion board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what to hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in her life she celebrated his own birthday with cakes ; they danced and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
for so many years now , I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have made some things , for example like our identities on our hus@@ bands , have never been said to be honest .
it feels great to be able to say certain things noisy , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have carried only coff@@ in since their marriage .
for most it is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ mon @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they did not dare .
after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes @-@ choice , morality associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , S@@ mug@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a panel , so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini , it is certain that they will succeed .
on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of their hus@@ bands .
some , including me , make it even , but only when they are alone and are not other family members .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands . only one or two women bear them at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women at the disc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the wedge for more freedom of movement or their own clothes choice - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating the river .
by giving each other self confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini says :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home in the club and reported other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of flat people for organizing stores , probably for aber@@ rated purposes , troubled the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practitioner .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims has been de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs have been removed .
two men were arrested and reported in the episode that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
it will give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man of man could bring gold contained or wealth , the Poli@@ ze@@ al@@ pre@@ cher explained by Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia from the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks have been registered in Mozambique men in Mozambique .
another group that aims to achieve your goals for ob@@ sc@@ ure , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN in the South African country conducted a mission to examine these practitioners .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudices .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel into the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who are travelling to Mozambique follow G@@ lat@@ k men in Mozambique are goal of ritu@@ alistic attack , warned the mos@@ aic police according to the latest developments of three @-@ five men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the drilling took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ans in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already going to post :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the hal@@ low men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of ancient individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , for probably aber@@ rated rituals , has given cultural motives and is given by the traditional sham@@ ans to take this out the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also adm@@ its that a faith existed , according to which the victims would have in their mind , the riches generating power .
in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha divided on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blog@@ ger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , the pointed that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Mozambique faces :
I would like to take E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , DAS ashamed of a country where people would have ashamed to offer sex against good notes , and women would take their lives to make their bread , a country where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor col@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ ass@@ ent for aber@@ ration purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted , which aim at reaching the utmost wealth .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which probably was recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 , in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the de@@ tained Chinese Dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital because of liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( sovereign debt ) after he took part in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to that took part in democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a spokes@@ man told he did it as &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to call from the international community to allow the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , dip in Li@@ u X@@ ia , and permit him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully wi@@ red to the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised several reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
but a spokes@@ man refused to comment if the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow a treatment to Li@@ u abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s minister President Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into Sto@@ u after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 has been awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government was rus@@ hed to do so .
diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon , since 2010 exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
once the news had been dissemin@@ ated that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel @-@ committee brought up his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up its price in Oslo .
because of his de@@ tain@@ ement , he was unable to counter@@ rise his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a vote in which China was sum@@ mon@@ ed to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately by the house arrest , and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China to release the release of Li@@ us , as described in an explanation on 30 June : &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , we expect China to impose all restrictions on Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , so that he may help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth @-@ Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on 27 June that gave the message to the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the invitation of the U.S. Embassy pulled out an angry response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to make an in@@ con@@ ical and un@@ answered remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel movement and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a vote in Congress to push the Chinese government to push for Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o unconditional release in order for proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bitter / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Government of Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping was published on July 7th and 8th at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
previously diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Re@@ uters , that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex um Li@@ u might be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by visiting Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to worry about his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but police always over@@ see the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not permitted , with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um talks about :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights commitments , including free speech , and to release them for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s State Department called for China in an Declaration on 29 June on , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all treatments he , regardless of where , requires . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact to him .
although the message of France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , announced the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France would finally receive him .
Taiwan
the Council of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan called on 27 June to open Li@@ u , and to show a greater tolerance on those who require peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the governing Democratic Party , China also called on to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28th around Li@@ u and gave it that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for whom he had been punished for a harmon@@ ic , more stable and prosperous China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally involved and encouraged to me as I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or land ?
Singapore .
licence : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem fool@@ ish since Singapore is recognized as an independent state in Singapore .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam should be considered to be a city in Singapore .
this observation triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting at a meeting of the International Bureau of the Chamber of Commerce in New York , the Minister that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared in Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore was considered to be a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable land , you can say that we are not a country in the end .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of a escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory breaking .
Singapore , if you are not my country , eat land is it then ?
the reasons for Shan@@ dis@@ cur@@ sed reasons were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he appeared inv@@ ari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratically .
once you reach the issue of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from authorit@@ arian Mach@@ ines to be the present democrats , leaving the revol@@ ved logic since it adap@@ ts better to their power .
in the end , during the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam the answers to his American guests were given to our press , our Ju@@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he tar@@ ded such questions with non @-@ answers of rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ sh@@ gam to make his opinion clear since it did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ gr@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point , if he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by discussing his comment on the blog , he points out regarding the reviews that one should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ gam , according to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the co @-@ ordin@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so unequal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he worked in Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously has not meant it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ sh@@ gam , which makes a leader of a growing generation , which makes such a polem@@ ical statement .
I am over what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said very embarrass@@ ed ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , which I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ sh@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is really , and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review breaks the weaknesses of Shan@@ gh@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Shan@@ dis@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; affir@@ ms a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Freu@@ dian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , to which country walk the sovereign rights of the city in Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
as he plays an important role within the government of the government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ dis@@ gam are of severe importance .
why do they defend their military service , only do they defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay bills to invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink pay@@ roll ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
if the journal Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to the Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always was a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have angry a lot of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we always were a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of &quot; cute can@@ adian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your homeland or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors on certain parts of the world revealed , and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the newest part of this series originates from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by asking personal questions .
then , on my clarinet , the standard answer is followed : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook maybe in@@ war@@ dly against anger , if they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t bother me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag visible well on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other ... .
that was how I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Tru@@ mp , in front of the invasion of Iraq and the 11th September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried away small map@@ le blades at their luggage to differentiate themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
gender @-@ sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not just like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends , which I admired .
it would not make me a difference if you would like to switch to Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot;
first , being referred to as &quot; nice &quot; means to be more efficient - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but portable in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a very Canadian col@@ er ) .
if Canada really were a nation of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
harmless , meaning un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
this may be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things happening around one around .
I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major achievement of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders considered &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not talk often about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I join with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage , to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that took the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ des , which 2014 took power and restore the civil government , despite their promise , governed the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells about which rules he makes his girlfriend .
although not explicitly politically , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was an amazing success .
in the first three days , the video was shared on Facebook 1.@@ 25.@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ ke .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists opened the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ special about how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at the videos of the video that relates to some of the political issues that have been pursuing in Thailand for the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; possibly relate to the dra@@ fted section 44 of the provisional constitution , which grant an absolute decision @-@ making by the commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the He@@ aler Convention on important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous change , &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , activists , activists and other persons who are considered as critics from the jun@@ ta .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to safeguard activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , which over@@ sees online content and those who were accused of having sl@@ ander@@ ed the monarchy , pro@@ secuted .
Thailand is set a stri@@ pe against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts have warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payers .
in the video even shown how people are thrown into a black case before they put them into an interval camp , another problem case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in prison , because they allegedly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and internet users will face long arrest , they should ins@@ ul@@ ting the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ itated that was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in Eastern Europe .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East @-@ East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ al .
it has been over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ Military War was officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still heavily visible in this part of the republic .
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ n@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ k@@ asien .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , isolation , Geor@@ gi@@ ans , and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the most part of the Russians and the de@@ mar@@ es live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ k@@ asien .
in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10.000 people , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the total population of the district of 16@@ ,000 people had barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ wit@@ ches , are symbolic of the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are abandoned and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly .
he starts a conversation and it is hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; Why talk ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless less obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gartens , who served all the community .
now there is only paved road with remaining splend@@ or buildings .
the people who lived once in this place and made their contribution to the central bank economy of the Soviet Union .
in the Ge@@ ister@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which are still one or two families , you can see on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when she discovered me with the camera in his hand , pull her back immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother was forbidden to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply has forbidden us , this is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers their girlfriend something to and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ ers .
families are also involved in the subs@@ istence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the District administration provides free candles and bread in the villages .

about ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ alya as she is in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jun@@ han@@ se@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off @-@ Asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ asien &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial aid from her daughter and insist that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ ore monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aunt G@@ alya tells that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot constantly do so - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
together with her husband and the five common children in her house , G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ asch@@ a lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when war began .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
indeed , it is rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember the same day as the city and the war once were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our interview tends to be at the end , a little boy looks over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ted him back .
he plays with the ball that shu@@ ts the hill .
a group of children is now pursuing the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the dec@@ aying buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for uncertainty in their lives .

in Mexico hosts &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants in her long journey
Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Wall@@ ach@@ ula , the State Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission .
on the way to the migrants that cross Europe or Latin America , some places for their hospitality are known .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is headed by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ica , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink gl@@ int and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear shape .
it is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born there in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans that are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
for about 2,@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with r@@ ams , cru@@ mb@@ ling walls and beds made of metal .
in the court there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - still hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; mom Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept out on cardboard boxes .
it wants to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them drugs that they can not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that extracted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if m@@ um Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , which has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) posed with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make normal their first stop in South America and move towards north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a famous name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel alongside the circuit and that , Afri@@ cans are already talking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of his way@@ marks , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil previously and worked as building workers on building the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the ticket ticket after Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answers he sm@@ iles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that their guests often send their text messages to greet her or to report her over the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the impulse of her work .
she does not know much about Africa but their guests have brought her both chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps here very well known , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead @-@ end street leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valencia .
this winter , Valencia and his family were invited to their families in their small house .
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the bus tickets will be sold to numerous African immigrants .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ e comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he had f@@ lown out in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to pres@@ cribe money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for a accommodation and a Un@@ known , a single @-@ hand side , offered him the roof .
a few months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests .
in the courses the traveler reviews their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who went away .
like a proud grandmother they fed them in their album with numerous photos .
there &apos;s one of her daughter with African hair care that her has made a customer , some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more , young and elderly .
she laughs sad , while she would like her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repeated it every time . &quot; they have been gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install an monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang , from Twitter users , on the occasion of the sin@@ uses .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10th , the mobile users received a cell notification in the Tian@@ shan District of the City of Uru@@ m@@ qi , in which she points the District government to install a monitoring app , called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities will also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had already installed the app , with a private We@@ chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police that the app could determine the sources and distribution of terrorists , together with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ e &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the block@@ ages of por@@ no@@ graphi@@ cally websites , from online fraud , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker can manipulate or ste@@ al the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while reports of digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China is mostly concentrated on the experience of users in the larger cities of the East and South , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , op@@ pressive ethnic minorities like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to rest un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ous Internet isolation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media outlets &quot; images from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from the China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( on the one of the similar ones in China published , showed photos of a check@@ point where the police in@@ discrimin@@ ate the residents at optional , whether they have installed the monitoring app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian are certain that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point using a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained by up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances needed for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest @-@ rise technology .
we are back again in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the area of China &quot; ( on the basis of the one of this one ) published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the mechanical requirement of a Windows operating system and gives full access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become an electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are potentially a reaction to the directives of the city party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and associated facilities including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices .
a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned this new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , to register their &quot; personal ID card , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; this action does not viol@@ ate the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible rates , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , Part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Al J@@ il@@ ane revealed his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and imagine that you are alone on a place where everything is gone .
everything has gradually dissolved , and revealed a truth which is clearly identifiable , both inside and outside .
one that makes her name all honor .
one that has reflected in a list of feelings and expressions , that don &apos;t allow metaph@@ ors .
but if you get the reality again and you see behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters into beings of flesh and blood , and all cry according to death .
all doubt arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the unknown . you realize that you are caught up here between the walls that have established your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone built up stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but I have not yet reached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the head of the safety service it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proved his power over us as he even destroyed the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn away from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protests .
it was enough for the city to dis@@ solve the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ aming .
all the districts of the city are cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time , it was quiet , reg@@ att@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not set high demands on a city that has transplan@@ ted up to the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
on the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply was heard in the quarters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I interrupted the silence by saying several times , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house @-@ roof , crying out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice ref@@ uted through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joining me ; we joined us with a glorious picture that filled my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you are free the mind of the lamp but it is not interested in the t@@ ing@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power is ready to meet us at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he placed on .
then I learned the following thing : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can give you back your voice , after you put it all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I came there .
the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear like you &apos; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ou Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ ful eyes were laid on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really mour@@ n what to look for me in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I was in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure to my job when I answered , &quot; I would not think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never ceased to look to you in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret no word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in sol@@ itary and his father the same with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rock stri@@ fe that cur@@ sed is up to me today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome &quot; , an emotional torture , which I was subjected to months .
I run out the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I do with myself .
then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the individual cells .
I pre@@ dict all the details exactly before I for@@ ged the room .
otherwise they probably have a larger cell on this time .
I must share it with only one other de@@ tain@@ ees and may immediately put me on their permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ting to an old @-@ established communication method : to beat your own against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my ten@@ ders was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first pan@@ mate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells , one of the surrounding cells was a respectable man middle age that looks like me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , there are no distinctive fac@@ tions in me , and doctors are here not ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers are one of his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the great cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would hate him unless I stay .
liar .
I &apos;d like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to remove all these cro@@ ws , who lab@@ eled themselves at the fruits in the garden of my head .
from a distance I still hear them &quot; All @-@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ am .
there must be at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always to catch these time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the colour of the per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in Person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; At@@ spiel@@ ung on 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to listen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the secret of the secret : to protect the state security against us , and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak out in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - and thus they also played their con@@ fession@@ al map and rie@@ ve the narrow sight @-@ sight of their world view .
this is not a house , which here is not a country ; it is a curse to which they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I had the hear@@ ings and tre@@ ad on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man , at least he came to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in spite of the facial expressions , who are rel@@ aun@@ ted him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this day and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I answered not .
I used to get used to it , not to answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me in an ordinary communication means . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to it , although I had nothing done to earn this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to seize on me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lovingly &quot; confes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your hand@@ le@@ bar ro@@ ach on your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot be measured with him and you cannot with@@ hold your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams fell not enough , so she ex@@ chan@@ ts the reed by a cable inter@@ changeable .
during my first break , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked before being a trash collection sooner or whether that belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had four cables connected to each other to present us from their point of view , great invention of a huge cab@@ els .
within a single hour three of them are altern@@ ated , while I was still on the line .
I had lost any sensation in my body - and my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and found no favour of it , which is why he resor@@ ted to an electric up@@ stream .
flow f@@ lowed my whole body , enough to supply my entire district .
my semi @-@ naked body , which was out@@ stretched on the ground , was the perfect power leader .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay myself back again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours went out that came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the space . .@@ R@@ out with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I rep@@ lied with the voice of a creative young : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful worries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and gone , you will be reloc@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released myself .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ ani R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b speaks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + Community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken from A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends much of his time indo@@ ors ; sometimes he stro@@ lling to his canvas , even to his computer , and again to his couch .
what you can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine lips to discover .
he lives in the top of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had fulfilled his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had to flee from their village to Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ic@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and have questioned their well @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deal with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only find in his hometown Am@@ man Rel@@ ative , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his mind by borders , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he is not open to the US , he grants a special a@@ version against the US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones to do anything with his identity as the Palestinian fle@@ dged of the second generation - so he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and never before in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own living circumstances so &quot; stressed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured into two cups in water . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; in this time it is fores@@ een for Muslims from dawn to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ anic law also states that the public intake of food during Ramad@@ an is illegal .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sing called Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the d@@ oping coffee and the Sch@@ wa@@ den of K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose is primarily of freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when looking into neighboring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , it is avoidable to do basic things - as in the public during Ramad@@ an , to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled one appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ ani branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ ts@@ hop Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert .
the MP and former press review in the Islamic coalition of D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was &quot; precisely &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many employers also say the involvement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activ@@ ism that question the established legitimacy of authorit@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the Jama@@ ican people considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which continues to stand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is likely to not simply be sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic but actually a clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work to seem clear .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender standards to be Lei@@ be by re@@ formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre @-@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently crus@@ hed un@@ familiar woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
in the past few years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; honorary posts &apos; - the un@@ official exterior left .
in 2016 , human Rights Watch recognized its climax . however , the number of Hon@@ orary Consul@@ ate reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 ; however , Jordan is still lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who tried to ro@@ de the victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on the crime counter@@ insur@@ gency in 1954 women who are exposed to risk @-@ famili@@ al violence , &quot; to be held at in@@ definitely time in prison , &quot; and for her release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee by the family necessary that the woman will have nothing to happen .
even H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , even to shy away from topics , which in his country long as tab@@ u g@@ old .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes out that his work is political , however , is that he is his music , which is full of explicit ons@@ lau@@ ght on sexuality , freedom and expression , not from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to me politics was dra@@ gged , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs which are in the core can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and any other is it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get what you want &quot; - whether belief or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ sexuality or homo@@ sexuality .
he notices that hardly any one speaks in Jordan regarding the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality have been sharp@@ ly cens@@ ored up until in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Bur@@ ord@@ ani Online@@ program Ro@@ ya to later notice that his comments were ra@@ zed from the context , re@@ bran@@ ded and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; on Youtube it was loaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als are not talking to Islam .
he mentions Abu Nu@@ it , a poet of the eighth century , who is still in mind today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : when Abu Nu@@ ove , who was to work later on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century openly could write about homo@@ sexuality , why can Jordan ians not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks the freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Israeli intelligence service took several former government @-@ government and members of the Department of Lec@@ turer , with the ration@@ ale , they had expressed criticism in social media critical about the problems linked with deep @-@ rooted corruption in the country .
given that the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs thinks only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan ians .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has dri@@ lled M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it is H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , depres@@ sive and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ ani society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dreams not only dreams of bringing his work up to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will engage with the help of music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , spreading uni@@ tions , and in artificial kind . at least he hopes that .
until it is done , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue on and consequently also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the ne@@ uta festivals .
we suspected that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory implies that the fes@@ tivities , the drums and the dancing over more than one thousand years have been handed over and from a time , in the armies from the West Japan to mar@@ ched in the northeast , to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to pick up some great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have long been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fes@@ cars are straight to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True and a breathtaking way of spending his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metre high ground was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peruvian youth remot@@ ely from crime and promote a legitimate profession like those of the hair@@ cut .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road smo@@ b and illegal drug trading are daily .
an survey was published in April 2017 that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more norm@@ aly in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts to compete against each other , to create who you can create the most ex@@ tri@@ vial of looks , as one can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions can be found on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people , to exchange their weapons against hair dressing tools and instead of bad advice on education in hair art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the bi@@ quit@@ ous opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training sessions before the school year in March and reported on some of its successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the community and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ rilla war

use with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love message &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here in the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who have the chance to offer , affection ?
this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the foundation of Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the foundation of Bogot@@ a por la Re@@ public@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) that young people have taught letters to write letters .
only recently her country was a place of a historic event , and they wanted to make their part in it : after years of talks , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces Colum@@ bian ) , which forms the sl@@ ump of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was the sig@@ nat@@ ories of the peace agreement as such that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits .
but before the Colom@@ bian , there is a long way to speak of a real reconciliation , and of peace .
guer@@ rilla warfare , which have lived for many years in illegal camps , have been exposed to rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and carried their arms around the clock , have now to be integrated into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred against guer@@ ri@@ ers , has to record them in their ranks and assist them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans have joined together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love message to former guer@@ illa fighters to welcome them back into the company .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ illa of guer@@ illa - which should then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for letters to reconciliation was created in the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner , which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian was the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi that was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people who love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day for thousands of love letters , but those who need to forget it much more .
he plan , he told on to share his love with people this year , which in the most urgent way .
thus the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the discourse from a war history to a common history of peace .
so far the campaign was collected in more than 2000 letters .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and BogotÃ¡ .
&apos;@@ i have never thought that someone would forgive me . &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a traveled in the camp to give letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC , as they had done before , to counter@@ ing the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings can go through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between , &quot; told the political knowledge of Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a employee of the Govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we had passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ llas .
when I saw in one of the &apos; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &apos; ( a kind of hut , in which the guer@@ illa live ) , I saw a guer@@ illa that wrote something .
I was afraid to take part , because next to him on the bed , there was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ce , a deadly weapon in the ri@@ mp fl@@ acci@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke it nevertheless and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they just make ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter I wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so nice , so I reply to it . &quot; then I suddenly walked the tears about the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ce .
perhaps he was tired of the war , I was sorry to be all the years of fi@@ del@@ ity of this fighter and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of hunger . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there that wa@@ its with open arms .
up to now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
the pr@@ el@@ ude came students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC to a panel discussion .
the students grew up all over as already war and the F@@ ARC had already acted in secret .
that is why the leader of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals and provided insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice of the State on the whole Colom@@ bian people have experienced , we can contribute to shaping our society more equ@@ itable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a target of this size , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard heard and had no voting right now , and to realize that people whom I often saw as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings were caused by their life circumstances and their environment , was very painful to me .
the reality in which the land lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage , can teach us a little and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was proph@@ esy that after dis@@ armament peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as it gives inequality , hunger and a lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack the weapons and to protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now putting the F@@ ARC to the peace , to a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong to - all who rise from a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homo@@ sexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mailing .
with horror , activists have experienced the coverage of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends on like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ess on the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who share some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what &apos;s happening in the Republic currently .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports published the deterior@@ ation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chn@@ yan authorities , the susp@@ ects que@@ er men arres@@ ts and they were hidden in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
even since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown , you became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sabrina .
she went out of fear for her life in the USA .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer for a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife who tasted in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hesitation .
while I tried to help her , he made a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Che@@ chn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos were made by my documents through the whole of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was there to show some shopping basket from the back home of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time at Che@@ chn@@ yan : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you dish@@ on@@ ish the family before you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew the person not .
I just know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day .
apparently some women had gotten everything together and started to scre@@ am .
the man was f@@ lown .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I was driving that I had two key@@ boards in my right pul@@ mon@@ y .
OC Media : in which health wings were you placed - in those of the men or the women ?
Sabrina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name dr@@ auf ; but the doctor did understand and put me among the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ dal name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful of me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - Rel@@ ated , strangers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the requested to res@@ ign me to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some said to me , I would have to prove it by feeling above without the roads ; others wanted I was not changed in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just worse , and Photoshop .
I have bas@@ k size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family tried to handle this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some older people even talked to my mother on the streets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the entire Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a stri@@ ck around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car bl@@ acked out under the window , and a numer@@ ical plate with a 95 dr@@ auf
after it had happened for the third time , I realized that something was lazy .
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ checking the numer@@ ical signs - it turned out that I was pro@@ secuted .
OC Media : how did you f@@ lown ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but it did something un@@ belief .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them without having to register without ID , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash .
came and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know what hotel you st@@ ak . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prove you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this actually was my room number .
OC Media : do you have your family yet in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ u@@ topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements are I still in me .
as much as I wish , this emotional barrier I cannot overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually put trouble on how the person feels they remembered from their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who are dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for this , I needed to give up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has a half and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ramad@@ an no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an were hardly able to wait , and he did not shut a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
that I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; experienced by blood Gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ ung .
OC Media : will also be held by gay men in these secrecy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says , there would be not so many .
if , then above all those who have no rich relatives , or were dropped by their relatives , in order to face Kad@@ cy@@ ber judgment .
as far as I know , they will be held there so that they can present them later as terrorists .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked either a village or a military base .
understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply gone but deliberately sub@@ merged to reform themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is it just a hiding place or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was de@@ tained in Ar@@ gun and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after her beard was grown .
there was nothing new of them since .
they have simply taken them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was herself to be taken as these people .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there were no reports yet . we suppose that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise one could not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings are people who belong to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation already in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : I always wearing my hair for a long time .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already famous in Gros@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than it now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but ultimately was thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were t@@ apped ; I had colored lashes , carried the tube and short T@@ ops .
the Department of Health at the Sch@@ aria has never ins@@ ulated me a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people who met me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ire does not say about the evil of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you often say it to children if people get fun over sick .
OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed you are sick ?
Sabrina : yeah .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace be held ?
Sabrina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the schedule .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on morality in television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily on the behavior of women .
nevertheless , you could feel like the people of the city started to change .
he who was laugh@@ ed before and laugh@@ ed at a time , regarded you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I got back home I could sense how the situation in the Republic constantly worsen@@ ed .
OC Media : what do you work now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the U.S. is not much .
besides that I am still working as an activ@@ ist .
at present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ up , gather@@ ings , I beg@@ ged them to the hospital and helping them to get Essen@@ sk@@ arten .
I didn &apos;t get any pen@@ ny for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself , when I ap@@ per@@ ed sli@@ ces .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ ev@@ ous .
so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion at all .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to white you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no spon@@ ges with them .
the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have which cables have , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet there are they - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something .
here I get so many men from the Caucasus .
many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque and during Ramad@@ an - live with men .
do you know a lot of thinking about Transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ sting .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be exact , different lifestyles .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I am sorry that I am here so personal , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of su@@ ici@@ des within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last months there has been a strong increase in su@@ ici@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August reg@@ ained the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the South@@ west of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own helpl@@ essness that may arise in@@ capacity for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi rights groups , who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
one on YouTube has held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people made it fast to clear the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide who acquired himself in August in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists on site warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month was some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ i and Sha@@ ke Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - sublime .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who feel helpl@@ ess and in@@ able due to the persecution of the Iranian government , to feed their families and follow a safe work .
Arab gene@@ alogy suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of Iran &apos;s Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community is located , was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
a century ago the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took over power and under@@ took a great effort to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
there are some of the largest oil and gas areas in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , as well as some of the most important and valuable farm areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing slowly , and the native population gets only little of that wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships .
Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Arabs systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are surrounded .
these dam@@ s have only led to exac@@ erb@@ ate the devast@@ ation in the region and destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director @-@ General for Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed the elementary school , 55 % a further school ended and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ ral rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; resulted in a &quot; high increase &quot; of the number of su@@ ici@@ des among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions do not preferred Arab force workers , the local Arabic Ah@@ w@@ azi will be removed from access to labour @-@ possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livel@@ ih@@ oods outside their home &quot; Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
there are people who had to change their suburbs and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi and to be challenged , as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must endure , suggest human rights activ@@ ists alarm , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not identify me with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide las@@ i and was originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . this article was subject matter of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought about scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ists * inside .
for example , women today still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to doing what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass blan@@ ket earlier or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex still draws across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well known .
I am convinced that I will be twice and triple beneath them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I speak on skin color , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q church , or on black women from the Diaspora . when I mention , on which way we have been physically , mentally , and verb@@ ally used , both in and outside the feminist movement , decide to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to up@@ lift their voices and to sing &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya to sing my lord , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alized form of racial and motiv@@ ational violence that we are exposed to black women on a two fold manner .
or on that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and herds places less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls often referred to school with a migration background more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all the men and all men of any skin colour the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot connect myself as black woman in whose center the white woman is ref@@ uses to consider un@@ righteous in their thinking , which relate to the gender and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will not fight for my membership in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which always rejected me and countless other black women and again and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained about 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also have reli@@ ant me to maintain a ideology in which black women is in a historical point of human@@ ized and margin@@ alized beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I consecr@@ ate myself to join me group@@ ings which also absor@@ bing our customs and customs to drive her ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to gain white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to keep the meaning of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give a home to women from different hostels and boundaries themselves from white femin@@ ism is still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prefer to releasing me from femin@@ ism and re@@ join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman who is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever that we define black women and we define ourselves according to our own ideas and enter into the sphere of being created by us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson River We@@ aving the author of the book Afri@@ cana perhaps : Rec@@ laim@@ ing Rec@@ eption ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in this way we can also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make the black woman shape .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are calling immediately separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in that paradigm I exist .
I will be recognized by my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is neither betrayed nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ ad@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations

in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution at his church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; tells Mus@@ a .

Paragu@@ ay@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of Article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # female ) which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the persons affected .
a police commander said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ partner who had become violent to her against violent .
since the end of her relationship had passed some time and the police said , their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not do .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena presented because of mis@@ action , useful also the acute adver@@ t of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing .
a few days later the second woman moved her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are given any display at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit , to be victims of violence , report to the prosecution authorities .
inhal@@ ation 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ seen abuse and a legal system that has nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ ed 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation of bats and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are actually distr@@ acted , My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez tells , researchers for gender issues in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , which , however , do not even accum@@ ulate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the available numbers are al@@ arm@@ ing .
in 2015 the District council had 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads found in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads dealing with domestic violence at the peace courts . also here 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads said 40 % of women found they physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic mis@@ conduct .
these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ an women &apos;s minister@@ ing in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these criminal off@@ ences are actually shown . &quot; on any woman who will not be re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic mis@@ action will come 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who will be re@@ funded because of physical distr@@ action , come two women who do not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared it at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s su@@ icide in Paraguay is not an own criminal law , the prosecution authorities may not document how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days dies a woman due to violence .

invisible abuse and a legal system that does not stop anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called his name to him all of her former friends .
in the beginning they didn &apos;t want it , but then after . this should always rep@@ ent them .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos . but for two years she bore psychological violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognis@@ able the most severe :
I never thought that I would become the victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that the only women are happening to be fool@@ ed because they decei@@ ve themselves by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name written , she wrote posts on fac@@ ebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks throughout their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to conc@@ ede that his behaviour has also been a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen out of Carlos for so long and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least one certain fellow to blame .
Victoria San@@ tos , which does not originate from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner she negoti@@ ates her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te C@@ RE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case all started with psychological abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince them that it was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vict@@ ori@@ as advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
it led a process against its former partners who developed into an in@@ consistent legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach , in@@ effective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a path full of re@@ pris@@ ings and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ec@@ n ( # FÃ¼r@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law considers before Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain to an independent criminal offen@@ se and to pun@@ ish like it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the law @-@ text was altered in some points in order to also win the parliament@@ arians for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are paved , which are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years in prison .
the original bill had been planned , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which have to present the victims of violence themselves , if they just want to report only the display and wish to receive a safe accommodation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; echo@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator has no adequate financial resources for it : &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Paraguay Mis@@ trading is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
a transformation will take place here , so that violence is no longer considered a bit of Nor@@ mal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever talks in view of these facts is guilty and contributes to the offen@@ ders of the offen@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must report such a long ad until Mis@@ trading is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . before , parts of the law had been altered . in other things , a passage was cancelled , which called partners in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the passage regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dispute of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered to be a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of Article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # female ) which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the persons affected .
independent media in Oman a year after bann@@ ing a newspaper continues to ban attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this site was blocked because of a description of the information minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is located on the homepage of the Forbidden Country Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking paper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corruption in the Sultan .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he wi@@ ped a prison sentence .
two other editor of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court , but came later again .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power since he had placed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur by a state coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important branches in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of sult@@ ans is marked by the persever@@ ing efforts of the security forces , particularly the domestic and human rights , including freedom of freedom , religious freedom , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists , to intimi@@ date and de@@ tained .
the authorities maintain peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent magazine , in which since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , who was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties of the judiciary , &quot; it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in a inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Board of Directors , was charged from the ISS before the special department and was arrested on his arrival by the security guards .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS participated in the deputy chief editor at You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acts as an editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
the paper was closed at un@@ specified time after the Minister of Foreign Minister had given the statement that &quot; publishing and spreading the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first hearing took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court condemned three journalists to prison guards and orda@@ ined the final closing of the paper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were judged both among others due to disorder of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ excav@@ ation of the press of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es at the level of each 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year professional ban on the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a prison sentence of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after having use &quot; an information grid to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a b@@ ail was set up at the altitude of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was already released on 22 August 2016 in the event of judgment .
the Court of Appe@@ al said to Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 imprisonment of his six @-@ month imprisonment sentence in mas@@ h . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to prison his prison sentence .
the Court of Appe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court to resume Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to be suspended even before attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received a statement by which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another statement , in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister asked himself another time against the decision of the Appe@@ al Court to permit the publication of the newspaper again .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman has been violated in recent times .
for further violations , such as closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
due to the prolonged closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the regulatory authorities are still not prepared to end the comprehensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2 . creating a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper in order to enable their journalists to follow their jobs ;
3 . to protect freedom of press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ dered their ri@@ ghtful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including geri@@ cht@@ ower ships .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ state organisation , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of opinion and association , and to protect themselves peacefully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understandings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with permission
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing segment , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site : for example , there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases like AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , while building own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the centr@@ alist in the Centre for research of Infectious Disease in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew in Lus@@ aka in the 1990s , especially as the AIDS Epide@@ mic &apos;s first serious impact on national health .
he left Sam@@ bia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he researched himself on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understandings of the media about this research .
( Disclaim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ er speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
furthermore , I have just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
A@@ GA : what do you think about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only set solutions that have been developed somewhere else .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being mine .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
A@@ GA : where does the financing and support come from ?
is she adequate ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to go back or come here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
A@@ GA : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
A@@ GA : how big do you think is the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is a need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer science , big data , research of outer space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
GV : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed of doing things , and the complicated access to scientific expertise that represent here challenges .
the system that magazines article make available only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producer change worldwide food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine , reports about solutions for environmental issues around the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton was born in the USA since the 1980s .
its enterprise offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant , cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was carried only by his own imagination and the question how many sal@@ ads were able to get boundaries .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he re@@ marked that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents are not only intended for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton or und@@ ulate leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more plants such as cereals or cart@@ els . because of these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security concerns the future of food production .
being a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breed salad , but he does not need any longer , since his work is continually increasing by ever more constraints .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like being in a river a rock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to keep the p@@ umped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far at Sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed any more of a new sal@@ ads , because all features already patented . &quot; he is thus doing as good as possible and tries to raise those characteristics that he wants .
however , it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
it is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Center ISS have bred red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there , it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector would originate and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was called into being to ensure that some plant species and anti@@ gens are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently available for plant breeders .
within the framework of the initiative , in short of Os@@ si , US @-@ breeders can commit themselves to others that others would be able to use seeds free of them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to cross their seed to breeding their seed , and it &apos;s not immediately out@@ fit - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dark prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ zed Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both for food security and environmental protection .
seeds play him a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would attempt to use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stressed that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified crops .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , the latest examples of the dis@@ appearing of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Monsanto and Bayer are announced that in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way it is cultivated on farms , should also know that the way that this vegetables is bred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dietary sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to tailor @-@ made seeds to other seeds . thus , its action is in contrast to patent @-@ good and plant @-@ features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed , since the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material , which thus always shr@@ inks .
Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in their doctoral thesis with genetically variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about one @-@ third of all Kart@@ ot@@ ten@@ features is protected as intellectual property , making it either not or only difficult for plant breeders .
for other plants there are still no such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass@@ aging plants like wheat is patented in a bigger scale as a salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are being cultivated so bred that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those , through which their taste or colour improved up to such due to which they maintain in particular environments and threats like p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder by becoming more and more patents . genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto @-@ Spe@@ cher@@ in C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to is that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial to mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four Gen@@ banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company stands for the preservation of genetic variety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that the intellectual property of other breeders &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ops innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent is up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
thus , such protection inhi@@ bits innovations , but promotes it , by providing the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees the other : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ired , it certainly does not support innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to be able to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and still should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor the money for such formations , and mon@@ e@@ at@@ ables are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mor@@ ton goes to the concept of pat@@ ently , plant features : &quot; we do not create the features themselves .
they form the plants themselves and as breeders , we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is still another important aspect of crop @-@ breeding : &quot; who ch@@ okes a variety , and also breed his own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large pan@@ ties and mono@@ cultures , which are needed for their cultivation in fashion jewellery , which breed in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just gent@@ am@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium sized enterprises ( such that are moving to international markets , but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding , or both is the case .
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton looks for his breed garden sal@@ ads .

Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ ent products would be innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than the enterprise .
I need constantly new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent you &apos;re protected from competition for 20 years , with what you think it &apos;s pretty simple . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading quickly and quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program works together with farmers , helping them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , present because of the Os@@ si obligation , not just one to become one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it contradic@@ ts itself against the current practice of the European Patent ts , the patents on conventional cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to put the patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems in Ethiopia , the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , that the organization currently comp@@ osing a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for the planned next year of the official launch .
a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group to ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a network of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - published a report , it represents that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , to exchange and improve seed policy , so ensure a stable supply of food products .
in the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes to see him soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to make people clear that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still , the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on weekends , the Egyptian Government st@@ acked the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world .
August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
that of the Network for Human Rights Information abi@@ des in spite of this attack and the removal of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities which should defend the law in this part of the world and to give victims a voice so it has never been so difficult to overcome these goals in order to overcome the block and not give up . we insist that our task will continue to fulfil .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites , such as b@@ lown the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar coming network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ H@@ RI there is no access to Egypt &apos;s blog and human rights research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissemination of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles that he does not write to availability websites and media in Egypt .
now , the blog , which he was built to circum@@ vent the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even target of an attack .
Blog@@ ger , which is native to the blog of the zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video like the police exer@@ ted physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced to the block by the government and reflected , what this means to him :
the , blogs to block is very old , but has given priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ ine@@ ae al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block of blogs might not be significant for the world , it is however for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has managed to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege of si@@ ege ; a arrest , a attempted murder , a attempted murder , sub@@ loading of the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web page , for which I worked .
2 ) They have proven that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have an effect , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I took advantage of it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or@@ ship .
now however , after having blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ te go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the block of providers , which was possible through the transformation of inter@@ networks and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how to offer the block of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice suggests the purpose of the government to block and filter content and filter access to the Egyptian users .
the situation in addition will be exac@@ erb@@ ated that the cens@@ ors decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed before the court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro at war ?
the inhabitants are dispute .

day after day newspapers reported in whole Brazil with ble@@ ak head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; Because of the second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro have been murdered , &quot; Die@@ be smo@@ ked pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the powers of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called for the United Nations to intervene .
reports such as these are common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
thus , for detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August , &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city now will be published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sex dis@@ ruption , etc . all , but what happens by the civil@@ ised standard and what happened in Rio is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as a journalist do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor &apos;s editor , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a military resting in a country that does not recognize war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that it provides information from the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war rate , if he is distor@@ ted , can also be used , atrocities the police which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to cover .
but we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than it uses ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil argued the journalist of Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra on the other hand , describing the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility in the police to account .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , clarification and historical and self @-@ confident neglect of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

in the beginning , this actually led to a withdrawal of violent deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP , however , has led to several reports of ra@@ ils and re@@ pres@@ sions against poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack .
on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not adopt the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also moves to serious consequences for the people .
for this calls upon the state to use means and ways that are typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; collagen damage . &quot;
war to or her , fact is that inhabitants of the Fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib , currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
it is particularly strongly affected by the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume it , based on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was practiced by Assad regime .
since 2013 they were under si@@ ege controlled areas outside of Damascus under si@@ ege , which led to them that inhabitants are dependent on local people or on tunnels and control points .
through the years of experience , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ party , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms does not belong to the conventional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare parts of the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the direct route of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said towards the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of fungi , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that already for three years has been fought for this project , and expressed his relief that it gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; famili@@ arity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families skills to planting fungi , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target from around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity in 80 % .
due to fuel @-@ scar@@ city locally , fuel agents are used in plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , they started with the &quot; production from the region mushroom &quot; before they check out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this was successful , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they have found mushrooms free everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break under si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new source of food on the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating the food @-@ remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21st in many districts of District cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that took place in the North of Portugal at the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died , and about 70 were injured due to the forest fires of the 15th and 16th October . this led to the fact that the government called out solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state period .
fires have also been registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ bur@@ sts that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
in June it occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured due to fires .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photographs , in 2017 , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned alone in Portugal - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter @-@ users shared pictures :

numerous videos spread over the net and show images that allow better insights into the project :
the predictable tragedy
the aim of the protests of the Saturday was the demand for better precau@@ tionary and burning measures by the State .
people asked themselves why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o Sover@@ al , from the federal government of Portugal , the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o , declared :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
on this Sunday they did this nowhere . there are d@@ utz@@ ander@@ thal reports of open streets , which were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would happen again as in June , as the streets were blocked very late . &quot;
furthermore , building permits in est@@ r@@ ties with high Bran@@ dr@@ isi@@ ko will be questioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a broad proposal for the re@@ vs which the government had brought up after severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the municipalities which saw new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a relaxation of the law , which provided the autonomy from case to self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; results JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article from the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us made aware that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of slightly fl@@ amm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of that kind .
regarding these problems , the site of the civil protection of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , as inhabitants sought or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers of JoÃ£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire@@ brig@@ ade and was so critical in the end of October that the server per@@ secuted the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who were watched the fires : thereby the site t@@ acked more than half a million gri@@ ps .

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to the successful entrepreneur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lasting pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan was turned into a country of terror and despair .
exactly at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati is a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Asia @-@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
at dawn , the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the chim@@ ney .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the ruling party E@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt rep@@ ain@@ less .
the Taliban ru@@ ined for her hatred towards the Haz@@ ara Taliban were getting closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a cohesion . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wages , and went in Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish s@@ acks with mor@@ tar , which were more difficult than he himself , to make his living .
back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remembered A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site , where we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we cleared n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we won &apos;t get refres@@ hed at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af gave his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ per 2002 came to Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food to the needy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers , but it is also true that the conditions , the asylum seekers in the country are des@@ astro@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ al Union for Europe is writing , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Italian law asylum seekers can only be allocated to an entrance centre if they officially set an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for a month after the registration of the asylum application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until then there are people who have no money for accommodation , rely on the hospitality of friends or must sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ adul@@ thood helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself out of these conditions soon .
after having done various work in the building industry several years , A@@ shar@@ af tasted his entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a Schn@@ ul@@ lim@@ b .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of the Afgh@@ ans companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience in Venice , where the wa@@ iter and the cup@@ board are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals range far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y and the retail , and aim back to the land which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ uro @-@ Report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and emerging trends in worldwide inter@@ ne@@ ties shows
the Egyptian Parliament has reviewed a draft law which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency .
users must use to take advantage of social networking within six months after successful legislation on the authority of the authority under specification of their full name as well as identification number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to six months of prison or the withdrawal of a sentence .
the law , which was advertised by sixty parliament@@ arians , is currently the legislative and constitutional committee in the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there .
may , another deputy proposal to be introduced in the harsh pen@@ alties for ins@@ ul@@ ting the president or a high officials would be introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law the ins@@ ults of the President as well as state institutions is already stra@@ ined . however , under the proposed proposal , such an action would be punished with pris@@ ons and fin@@ es , thus right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been at risk for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took photographs on 13 August 2013 , while he demonstrated violence against demonstrators , who demonstrated military coup against the President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just like more than 700 protest participants , who were arrested in the same incident , four years in prison on a court .
recently his hear@@ ed was postponed to 20 May , because the pris@@ ons of human rights groups had failed to bring the accused of the prison into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty on account of one , so many human rights groups agree , hypo@@ load of others arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case a pen@@ al court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , sam@@ hi Must@@ af@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisian activists through penetr@@ ated documents
Mai spent six hours with the hearing of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly listening to a penetr@@ ated action plan . his plan was explicitly supported by the President of the Republic , the business@@ man and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused Am@@ nesty , provided these all non @-@ legitimate money back .
the document released on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , casts a light on how the presidential term plans to support the legislation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the disclosure of his sources under specification of article 11 of the Tunisian press , which re@@ ensures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
will China comp@@ el the users of social media to submit your ID @-@ ID ?
according to new provisions of the Information Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that the registration will be required with the full real name .
the analy@@ st suspect that through the elimination of anonymous comments in enter@@ tain@@ ments within social networks shall be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities apply these rules .
Chinese European citizens have proposed resolutions in social media to enforce these regulations only in order to protect the bourgeois journ@@ alism and its independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
Mai sper@@ sed the state cens@@ or@@ ship of Russia access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or failed white @-@ chat to register with the state government as the &quot; organizer of the information @-@ proliferation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government is conducting a list of online services which will organise the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publication of the information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the law allows the government to be responsible for removal of content and to force them on request for suspension of user data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these web pages are currently on websites like V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ de@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and use of other services .
Turkish Court has spar@@ se Wikipe@@ di@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the block Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators were refused to clear two English @-@ speaking articles , the information , Turkey supported the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and Communication was closed , the site was closed because it works to &quot; a source of information that works with groups to adopt a political black@@ mailing campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey blocks the website completely . it is thus , besides China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can not stop beating heart@@ beat
following this week , the British Government is in the midst of targeted consultation with increased surveillance systems that would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install back@@ door programs to de@@ code the data encryption .
but the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
however , the consultation will still run until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the Interior Ministry .
