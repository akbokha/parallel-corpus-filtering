<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I also grew up with American films, I have danced to American music, American writers were read and made his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly made for an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14 years I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pellet letter, a terrible reporter who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura Students, the murderous conspiracy of a oil magnates who were the Supreme Court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free according to Method Man, "I was, as if it's the absolute truth, I forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only been reinforced.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then, Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as it goes with his narrow-minded approach.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his mind behind the mountain, as he says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "nevertheless people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes won in the republican elections, was the highest number ever achieved by the Party candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't bring Trump and his voters with people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism program, came up from around the world, a profound person to whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps worldview is not represented by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours trying to watch the "Phoenix" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr who struggles for her life on the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits in to the commitment of Kristi Kappes which helped me to get used to the complexity of American life with a lot of patience and grace.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there was Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those of them embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump was his way to nominate republican presidential candidate, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared its racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to describe the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange the people, "said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an incapacity to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Anm.).: as much as" "" "lifting of white against all other ethnicities," "" "wordplay from white in reference to the White and whiplash, which means so much like slingerie, as it was the great Van Jones, has just killed what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose to be his president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America that promises to say and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brood the multitude.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "do Latinos have a seat in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "have Afro Americans a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a consistent and sounding 'NEXT'!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, "said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played in both places, not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among the tourists -but worlds far from the nearby scenic ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a couple of years, the La Banda de Música (Musikbande) has now been playing a symphony symphony orchestra which has found their musical instruments to overcome poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English Newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and banden-violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But it changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, which started a musical project and the youth had thus offered a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, means the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, glgos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing a village, which is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay capital - on instruments that are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycler under the direction of Favio Chavez has started to transform parts of the crash into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, violins, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpet and percussion, which were all produced from the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguette and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local eco-ologist and musician instructor of the children of Cateura, reminiscent of the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them are not living together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a made from waste generation.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments made of playback material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tonnes of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest people - like the people of Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully combat the illegal fishing industry</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reported on international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication is done as part of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time it was known that this ship already had operated in lified waters of illegal fishing, before the other coast of Africa was looking for.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore disinclined and somewhat inclined to welcome a violating of this species on their shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they stayed in it, one of their ports and refused to give him a fisherman's own.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply put everything in it," "" "remember Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisherman. he is part of a team that was discovered and followed the ship at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, because of pillage the fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO Stop illegFishing (Illegal fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that then had the Premier of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand for each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending illegal Fishing. this project provides support for FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is defined by definition: what is caught, is hidden, present because of it is extremely difficult to split doors. thus, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Through the intentional disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecosystems which have a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing once were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snow-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are occurring today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There the individual countries can share or exchange lists of existing licenses for example, news on suspicious activities or details that you noticed during a port review.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in bottled areas - such as suspects transit routes, such as such, that suggests that a ship invites its captured fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the idealcase, such surveys can show whether the ships involved have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly, whether they have a criminal spirits.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports on the basis of such information, meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to avoid sanctions, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, leader director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a counselling company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The platform previously mentioned was created to regain 20 million USD in lost sales, which lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of the illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing villages, present for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. under these same illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">For their practices, including actions as the sailing on false flag, fake licpapers, indicating the fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fishing in reserves areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"they consistently use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an incomplete, organised control system," says Long. "earlier, a ship could become illegal fishing and a country could not say" You dared to run my harbour. "</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Comm to me" "". "" "" "and this legal slip hole is trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered crimes that had fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it volatile ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over high distances and preserved.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to instruct ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that will always be further developed, also helps to record the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and this is why we try to cross" "", "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be contracted by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps build a system that connects various information levels with each other. it is designed to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO New Truth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana, the platform Global Fishing Watch opened: a platform that can display satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of every single traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is where - this is simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but also scare deterred.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships used to be confiscated in the past without a license and have little to reckon with consequences now, they now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in the meantime a 33% increase in fishing services that have since buy fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia has helped to record Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board townets, whose use is forbidden.</seg>

<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also have other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars per year disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there are 2015 six countries together with so called West Africa Task Force." "" "they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "security is the goal to make even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions" "", "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent member state was able to report to its first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that went under false flag. and not only was the ship used without license and were used towing networks, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into bottled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of a interviews with Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinian message page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to join the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the meantime, he said Quijano in the context of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process that ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated, which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden, to carry the same name as his father to the brutal spears in the prison of La Perla, which he watched at the age of 15 he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">34 years he held the family of trade for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation back then I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated from his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realise that my father was a thief, Folterer and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmerieofficials. during the Argentinean Military Tribunal from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was in prison by 1976 until 1978 Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division 141 in La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archiving.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10-year child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quixos son, a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy in the course of the years, and who said before a federal tribunal against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the Sports Hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take care of the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had a young boy who made combat sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">"" "all called him" "" "Kent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo, and urged me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an Arshole, you have completed you with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they will not take you one day, and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - the revolutionist army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Labour Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he offered me to go back to the sports hall. some days later, he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would be a secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had brought me up.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy Papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, Propagandelids, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'as the prisoners are tortured there</seg>
<seg id="230">My dad took me a total of four times to La Perla with - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time, he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to get out. he led me to a bargain, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small into a blanket of pastry and commanded me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were thrown and signed me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">As the prisoners are tortured there, the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I pointed out and saw a couch, tortured on man.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attach it to one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the person's body that was just there.</seg>
<seg id="241">She rarely gets a man with handcuffs on the bed, poured them with water and said to him a load of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="243">The ridge there was in there was appalling... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately again and told me it became clear that the smell of a body in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself, how is it possible that a man can do with another so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i knew that these people were killed. '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated with handcuffs and were able to tie.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the process) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying with the face - they were all in hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the proximity of the entrance, people remain silent on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father remarked that I saw the prisoners, he said, "What do you do so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I answered, Why did you otherwise bring me? "</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were cast into a tomb and were killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La cuadra there were some rooms known as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero there had a man together and killed there.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to the survivors of the civil war Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla-Ribera process, the students Raúl Mateo Molina were sentenced to death).</seg>
<seg id="261">In the following video Emilio Fessia leads to the director of the memorial La Perla, through the former follicles chambers.</seg>
<seg id="262">The path that you came here is also the way in which the kidnapped came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">When you look on the map, see that they took about this way and then were tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were given a number assigned to the process of dehumanised.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that it should be relocated.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their corpses in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'Eye-mare'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father carried all sorts of stolen things at home.</seg>
<seg id="269">Back then at the age I had no idea what the "war-mare" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was in the military, I was in the gendarmerie - I realized that war-mare is a bayonet or perhaps military signs which one decreases an enemy that you have fought.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if one walks into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then this is not a war of war but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I have always wondered how my father, the leader of security forces, could participate in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer at gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and to steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my Father could do this.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal, and I said, and you who put cars on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded against anger, struck me and crying out:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and transfigured yourself.</seg>
<seg id="283">We need nobody else to do so!</seg>
<seg id="284">This was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no one good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo from that time when I was wearing a jacket and a scoundrel pullover. both my father had taken from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">Back then, the Defence accused me to have been with this crime. I resisted, no problem, they can lay myself to the burden what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I find remorse.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if you have children only, you recognize the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realize that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you have been exiled during the dictatorship of Man, but what the corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children take part?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with his mother, whose mother was killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have simply been able to put it into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I reckon it was simply decided to kill these people. but what their corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families to whom you could hand their mortal remnants?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abominable act that one can do to a human being.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was introduced again, they removed machines to eliminate the mortal remnants of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "they were smashed and somewhere deplete - no idea where." "" "you never find something," "" "said my father." ""</seg>
<seg id="306">But something of course still remains.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i have seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even with gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals, including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought to view my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I did not know him for all the atrocities that I had to experience at all times.</seg>
<seg id="313">"" "then he suddenly said," "" "I do not know. I have not killed anyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt wardly dead and asked me, why the whole exaggerated patriotism and the "Western and Christian sentiments," which they supposedly defended, were really good.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then, I called:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell a thing about me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">He resisted only "Na then put me on."</seg>
<seg id="320">That is exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I restore the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">Nobody can prescribe me that I am pretaken. I finally have said against my own father.</seg>

<seg id="350">Editing of the original photos of Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was the translator Julian Holmes, a local citizen of Kyotos. he was also who attentive the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>

<seg id="357">The police in Kyoto apologised for the translation errors. furthermore, they explained that the bug had already been included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation has not been tested on its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sorry that older people felt offended by the insufficient correction (the translation) in our part," said the Police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News was more executable with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terribly" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police there are the proportion of older motorists involved, who are involved in accidents, but quite cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents. this corresponds to a percentage of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">Thankfully, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native language. in general, the conviction that translators is in the target language - not in the source language - native language should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French mother language should translate as an example from English to French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue that could make translations into English. this may lack of lack of understanding, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who do not have foreign employees, let translations still be in company-internal. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best, for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and puzzling phrases that arise by machine translation, show that this technique cannot replace a long one human translator. this applies especially to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often used by T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or not understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may seem as jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city is hopefully to use a reputable source of its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7th, Venezuelan Internet users took no access to the online Sender Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presence of VPITV and El Capitolio TV is no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Also other online transmitter recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositionists groups who oppose the Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests were started at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court was dissolved, and the duties of the Parliament was transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was closed, and recommended the Users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinintro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by a block of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online stations. this also concerns the Internet site, where the National Assembly transfers their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research surveys by the Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had surrendered to use the local Internet provider to use DNS. this is a technique, through which the DNA-server requests of certain domains are faulty.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds or denied the request to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>

<seg id="409">Flores was knocked out, while he was in a police force.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went over again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government is reported to regulate the Internet connections: thus the Venezuelans will gain access to multi-media coverage over current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began working as a Criadita for the family. as Criadic, one calls in Paraguay up more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money handed out their inferior son or her underage daughter to another, plentiful family. in exchange the child receives food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">"" "" "" "however, what is not mentioned above is that children can do countless days of housework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a contract that cannot be lifted." ""</seg>
<seg id="425">These practices described as Criadazgo practice is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing their studies, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadita - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Crimean azgo - gathered testimonies, researched and pranged.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things in name because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated against the Criadita, is guaranteed to be silent in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double delusion," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "" "" "there is one hand the family that gave her daughter to faith that she could complete their training, improve their position in society and" "" "can make something out of themselves" "" "to another family." ""</seg>

<seg id="436">As Carolina Marín in Caaguazú came into hospital her body showed traces of violent strokes. in short, she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former Milás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as an official in the residence.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck together with a stick to Marín until they suffered deadly injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep-rooted practice of the Crimean azgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They signed the Crimean azgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest leaders and demanded that there should be no more Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay are more cows than children registered," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to hurt the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of adulterars and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a faster investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as labor force, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farming where her father worked, his course had to register and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all work and started to sell on the street or on the sweets market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>

<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six plots and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, which runs through the internet and used to communicate with other means of voice, videonachments and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities want to impose upon the registration of the Egyptian authorities and users who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media company.</seg>

<seg id="516">If I take them seriously then this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">How Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predators in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a large predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopards in the wild wild is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a big cat at the camera, Raza breaks in pure pleasure.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, documented in the northeastern Japan daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the past six years to re-establish the life of those who had been hit by the "Trinity catastrophe" of March 2011. a violent earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, situated in the Prefecture of Miyagi. prefecture of Miyagi was a etarted prefectures in Japan northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring towns of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuated, because the tsunami had all the coastal cities vanished from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">For this, the prefecture of Fukushima still lived a nuclear accident, already for that reason, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report from the Kahoku Shimpo reports from local perspective, which has been achieved after six years of age in order to re-establish the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese reconstruct as well as poll results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (of course, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures could deliver Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses while at Fukushima, with 70 per cent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, one still endeavours to continue to settle for six years after the disaster, evacuated of homes (s), casetitsu Juutaku) in final substitutes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 more and more than 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated coming from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in emergency shelters. over 75 per cent of the evacuated settlements, which were conquered by disaster in homes, were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo paper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by unhappiness, have opened their doors up to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">"" "" "" "six years later, the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures is much more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="562">During nearly 100 percent of the fishing industry in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation again, at Fukushima only 30 percent of fisheries have resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident, have moved into compassion in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Over 93 percent of its agricultural areas, Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear issue, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima lying in the "nuclear wave" zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism re-restarted again, but also here at Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are once again 90 percent on the same stand as in front of the disaster. however, Fukushima, however, can only be 75 per cent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it is harder to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine a total picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the native population and under the evacuated evacuated. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also how its feeling has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared for the future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has reinforced its attention to the position of the evacuated of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">In Fukushima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witnessing the worst, catastrophic, atomic accident, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuated evacuated from Fukushima nearly 63 000 people were moved out of areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, have been settled in permanent substitutes.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuated areas are most of the evacuated shelters, older than 50 years old. you must retire right away because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="627">The popular community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, who is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - irrespective of that there is no appreciable sugar-harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago, when the activities were put in the sugar mills.</seg>
<seg id="629">According to the decrees, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost gradually and according to its installations, until only the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent itself.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some are rarely the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resignified and commuters daily to the factories, which still grind.</seg>

<seg id="634">He heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar factories that are in operation after a long inactive time because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">It was something which he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls that exactly that in Mañas I would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise has not been held.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiencies, the poor management of administration and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">By 2016, the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for alarm for the country some decades, but the bad harvest is no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway stiff of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar-factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs led to such actions were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 until 2025, the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos must remain per pound according to the 2016 report" "" "agricultural" "" "of the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3,6 million tons), the raw export level would provide about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the lactation of a total of 98 sugar cane brands, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the beet factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked since 1967 in the factory.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as it is known as a soldier, is known about the closing of the factory, is the word he repeated most, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closure of the year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents that would only be removed in respect of the parts which would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ultimo Rosales del Toro, but the minister was able to approve any decision.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility was handed over and the letters were always more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the nursing factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money in operation for the sugar factories.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was opposed to his will at the lactation of the factory when building it helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, dismantled one of his 31 labor years.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with subjects that are important for them. they are doing so through Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour we have launched a workshop leader mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers, to teach youth groups of songwriting, recording, audio-, video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were headed by the Pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions about such as "cultural identity, language, discussion, love, self acceptance" or whatever comes up in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the territory of the trunk of the kite environment, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway for tears," a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen young women were usually vanished or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely ignored.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the conservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters are not always master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation received, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop Group, who gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan is at your disposal the Stanzhe in rewriting, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>

<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic courts before almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are being exhibited near the entrance shokuhin saniriu (this is where the plastic models of the dishes ") issued by any food, which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Great's district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small companies that produce just those plastic courts, which was documented by the German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even perceive them once more. however, a new trend is turned into showy cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published series of social media links and photos, which show this unusual twist with the shokuypuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic gerided mobile phones, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy objects, as in this case, cooling cabinet magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shoddy refrigerators for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a caisen-don (a popular travel bowl with seafood) was turned into a cell-edges.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone-stands.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also have made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that records your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to see like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the funny.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon-oestrogen uses, a popular game that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there any one who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can use my mobile with salmon-rogens?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I believe, I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts can also accept a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile phone-edges has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and Handytapes from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic dishes can be viewed under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # are the ones in the board included.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of foreign and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the mistrusts and transmissions regularly dive only in statistics. however, these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy which brings this battle with itself at all.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of Sinaloa Kartell, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourn, or on the congregations that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind any fracture in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories payable parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">"" "this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político" "" "Aprela Vivir Con El Narco" "" "(German:" "" "with drug trading experiences," "" ") to give these victims a voice and telling stories of people who, in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels." ""</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug traffickers and all churches have to ride many kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear lives changed") tells precisely these stories.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco," explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid. we have to show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state management.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be seen as normal, regardless of what shape they are occurring:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with illness and sensation of journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I'm passing every day at newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with images, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from the acquisition of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it acts like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider it normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-year-old cousin thinks that he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me that is, as if they strained those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are to mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the insomnia of people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbor could be justified, that they were" "" "receptionist" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to talk about that they will remain spared from such tragedies when they are not stir and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico-Stadt wrote the contribution of "four months blackmailing in the main town." in this she describes how armed criminals take money from their business, until they end up not only the business, but also their family had been torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you got lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain above never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes back high when you're alone.</seg>

<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the post" "" "forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence known." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a commodity and he tells that he himself had to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water, sugar and dairy powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant as compared to the pain in his eyes - Unspeakable for a boy for whom all life of violence exists and that had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez saw this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Juárez in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murder according to the State of Civil Rights and the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Prosecutor tried 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 Morde per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of thousands who leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of always new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we may not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," the data journalism project called Narcodata, whose objective is to raise the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed back to count corpses," "" "said a citizen to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>

<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the following-time images could be exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unexplained, but the army-based point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to attract Boko Haram, country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture came back from the Democratic Republic of Congo, when it was presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>

<seg id="851">In all of these cases the image was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments, such as this example, confessed the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange came in touch with the deadly persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that move these Posts. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence regarding the silence of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the slogan of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second froaming uses the image to discuss how a African life is underrated as a comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth examining how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question however is what happens when readers do not have any longer belief in these pictures.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are poor people who have unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest this mood of the mis- and false information that actual atrocity did untrue and flusks it the real atrophy of what actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that returning from images of refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, concern that violent images and viewers are desensitise and give them the ability to feel empathy (for example this study, investigating how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some talk about violent representations in the news media, fact, fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment, because with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News," you'll have to thoroughly think about situation in which a picture is sugary, which actually does not actually be used from the context or on completely miscellaneous species.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (eg. unreplaceable) makes every effort to offer language avid a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are words in each language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these insurmountable words are already well known today (such as the famous Portuguese suck) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all withstand stubbornly at any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a slightly different context is needed to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the VAT language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Bemüh you about your parents in recognition of how you have been trying to meet you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil how:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or sloth that you feel after you are tightened around cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They compensate other cultures, revealing other thought and wake up our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site would like to publish more of these "insurmountable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Redner the "Treasure Languages" which is highly appreciated by Untranslatable are invited to upload their favourite songs here.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They sanctize me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are around 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion different.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify with it to be Muslim but to different species but somehow we all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Storytellers, by Flickr users Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the telling of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the Unsuperable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not written on the spoken word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite such small languages are not passed on to the children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The project is valid for the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality in the world can be avoided when we create cities which accept diacces - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be listened to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening is often linked to understand" "" "for these events instead" "" "the listening to estimate, feel" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers present their story first in their own language and then translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storytellers, their devotion and the presentation lead to that the audiences can be pushed forward.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions that the language would no longer be a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video illustrates for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou were also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative for their land typical of the narrative of the narrative.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the tale of the rabbit and the Pavian in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">Having explained the importance of his tale, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide grins he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">You were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to date, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand it. all that are inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which lasted for 72 million US dollars, participated in the past 3 April 2017, various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass rally; the march started at the puertorian Capitol, the Government building of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de Colón in the old city of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrisch-Palestinian webdeveloper Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missed since more than one year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has made for an open grid.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on the digital culture, which is organized in Berlin, devoted to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühner, manager of Book Sprints, a publishing house carried out by so-called 'Book Sprints' made books within three to five days, lasen excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquets (The costs of freedom: a collective postresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that has been published last year and has been available for license, contains a number of sets that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to bait and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked side by side to look over the fog who surrounds our Newsfeeds and to create some sense out of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the Ydra prison directory in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information on his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title of collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that urge for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us can start thinking about their own destiny, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned with extreme convictions in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web development for open source and digital activist has been in prison for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, transferred to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer of Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel was based on a" strictly secret "command of the Military Tribunal of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as insider of the Assad government and took notice of a alleged death row against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Its length of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively participated in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project founded in Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the Bassels cultural prototypes are prescient as the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cruiser of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture-types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would all put on it, this architecture, which embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a period of time that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel was not able to complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life with it, of freedom to dream and bait taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has shared his knowledge with any he asked; he has taught other incarcerated teaching English to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without having in fact held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi also is the author of Waiting (Wait), a rehearsal which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They smuggled the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them from the Arab to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is license-free available.</seg>

<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind in the moment we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers does not matter,</seg>

<seg id="1239">To take back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I overwhelmed myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bassel wrote Ghazi:</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) has disappeared more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime, were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International has died in custody for at least 17.723 Syrians since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many more people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we reiterate our call for hope that we must do so for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: due to corruption defendant director after ports of prison returned to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique responded with anger to a corrupt fall, where a government member returned home after half his sentence in the state apparatus at which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants (about 800 000 Euro) for 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately demanded his re-recruitment into the company, which was then in April 19 then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the General Public Prosecutor of the Republic, who expelled the request, there would be no barriers to Cambaza again to refer to his old post since the company had no discipline proceedings after his custody.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people did not do the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Center for Public Health (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution that advocates the public transparency in an interview with the Deutsche Welle making the decision of the company to restore the director.</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of is that also the company should have a discipline proceedings against the violinist.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparent, however, prompted no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behaviour also and considers the case as "contradictory":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them have fallen.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold well-paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and record his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to become reintegrated into the company that he helped cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of policy science in Brazil says the director had no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he insulted him I can't believe that someone was rewarded by someone that is so massive with the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morals to return and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it has served itself only by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a handful of money source and the state itself became weary of this man who was charged and eventually condemned to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mosambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel, not only to be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp, intersecting and - incidentally - prophetic redundant.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network recorded their posts from the net, because they presented the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to human-Indian origin, or generally used as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or where the word" "" "Kalar" "" "may be used as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma into the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of a nationalist-nationalist motions of the word has given an extremely abnormal connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word which is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on his platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may still be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts in which they have reviewed the use of the word or have doubts to be expressed in the purpose of their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burmesical words with the different meanings, which have the same letters as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written at Burmically also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters, as well as other words such as' Kalar PAE '(verb),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' kalaraar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookused Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they knew how he could soothe his back pain by making a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "curing" (ku) + the frail (la) at Burmically - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hes is the opinion that she also lessen the language of hate speech, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytical before all posts defaults in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyse the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar PAE" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists are spreading the hate speech, receiving a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "" "" "now it is time to curb their nationalism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat demonstrated that the censorship of keywords often become a catz- and mouse game, whereby the users social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts as he only wanted to share his friends saying that the word 'Kalar' from the social network is banished:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends, that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "ironically, my post by Facebook was removed and I was forbidden to share the light, post and parts of content for 24 hours because the Post" "" "Facebook Community standards did not fail." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to demonstrate their opinions against hate-hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are poor.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook would have more to do before the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hate within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "moreover, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and so words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pesencurry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the counterfeit Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefit of them, which complained to them a great turnover, would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided for a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make use of Facebook funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook posts that have no hate language, but still removed:</seg>

<seg id="1336">In the last five years extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious fundamentalists are increasing to the social networks to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks play the violence in Myanmar, in addition to heating, especially in Rakhine where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure, criticised the liberating hate speech on his Burmese sides under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of arguing the word 'Kalar', it would be better to focus more on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1393">For over a month the Turkey has been spersed the popular and crowdsourcing principle of the Encyclopedia of Encyclopedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day is more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful information as well as reliable information and share.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are fighting against the block.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many advanced Internet users have used it, reuse tools for blocking websites (an up-to-date articles from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been unlocked in 2008 by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the internet has been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain closed, now several Mirror pages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlan File System), as the platform placed all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (so calculator machines) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is retrievable despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogger post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">Having heard the news (about the block of Wikipedia), we set all of it to dislocate Snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This may help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also mentioned that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklocky, an open source project, that everyone can use to host similar mirrorate sites, when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>

<seg id="1410">One click on a different URL that is not the original one. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself then when this is locked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he looked around around, never satisfied. they were blurry with poorly positioned motives and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated itself has a camera to bear in itself and try to understand the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was a kid.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar is trying to bring itself to the international scene as a wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which direct the attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, as it helps him this first-class position in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately began to knit pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to achieve global recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding of the fact that wild animals are not as fearful as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he was already standing on his face to face.</seg>
<seg id="1430">One tiger is not bothered by the opinion of the sheep not in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was at home because of darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the Buffer appeared. he immediately begins to see ourselves and he restled me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar is placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I clicked for the environment) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepas nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived mostly in a tent to make in the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds that live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid having the greatest care to speak the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect that she should respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should misrespect the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned by the Indian state of Odisha by a skilance and rejected by her family and the village community, having responded to a close relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of wives also does not name their wives, is also circulated among men. however, they have far less accessibility to fear, if at all, they should not return to this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, joined nine women, including health professionals, as well as housewives, a unique club and became quick to the main table of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Being one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal that is operated by the community Video Volunteers and advocates the mining of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the exposure of practices, such as child labour up to the exiation of HIV- and AIDS Indians, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs are created for a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them both ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini presented in its panel, acted by women who do not name their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to talk the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Speaking the name of their husbands is not loud utterance, a Brit is also capable of perpetusive and never put it into question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition shows that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this, is seen as a rear, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini, who had never named her husband by name, tried to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband stalks long after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should name him from now on with his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini started her first discussion board.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some felt that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the videoprojection, the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini, each participant asked the name of her husband with different feelings to say - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they asked all, "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they may call us how they want it means that they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women are married for 30 years, and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," Rohini Pawas from the village of Walh in Maharashtra via the Break of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women may never speak their husbands' name.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she had kicked her during the whole exercise only before him; another chose to let the whole squandering frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenalin rush about it, having an ancient Brings broke out, the women decided that they were actually trying at home to call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into his head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it during dinner prior to the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-in-law she was frightened, she got afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said, I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding, and the situation arisen in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred spot on the forehead, which indicates the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnoberred point if he also took it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs only and I listened to him to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped working completely, but think they are in a better position, even to choose not to bear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion board is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we will take a trip at each discussion board." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to worry about women who could hear what to hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in her life she celebrated his own birthday with cakes; they danced and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">For so many years now, I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have made some things, for example like our identities on our husbands, have never been said to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things noisy, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only coffin since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salmon-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes-choice, morality associated with the Saris and much more, Smuggelte Rohini their own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a panel, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry jeans and Rohini, it is certain that they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it even, but only when they are alone and are not other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands. only one or two women bear them at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women at the discussionist know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the wedge for more freedom of movement or their own clothes choice - at the end of a hard to navigating the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home in the club and reported other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The fall of the detained Chinese Dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital because of liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (sovereign debt) after he took part in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that took part in democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Lius case as "an internal matter" and a spokesman told he did it as "not required to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>

<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon, since 2010 exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Once the news had been disseminated that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel-committee brought up his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up its price in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his detainement, he was unable to counterrise his price.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish since Singapore is recognized as an independent state in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered to be a city in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at a meeting of the International Bureau of the Chamber of Commerce in New York, the Minister that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared in Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore was considered to be a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "rotate the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrificing to create this valuable land, you can say that we are not a country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory breaking.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, eat land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shandiscursed reasons were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the issue of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from authoritarian Machines to be the present democrats, leaving the revolved logic since it adapts better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, during the last week of Shanmugam the answers to his American guests were given to our press, our Judictative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarded such questions with non-answers of rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanshgam to make his opinion clear since it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werter K Shangrgam would take the effort to clarify this point, if he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By discussing his comment on the blog, he points out regarding the reviews that one should begin to read the entire co-ordinance of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shangrgam, according to which Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the co-ordinance.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "as he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He worked in Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "as he said, Singapore" "" "be no country," "" "he obviously has not meant it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanshgam, which makes a leader of a growing generation, which makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am over what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, which I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanshgam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is really, and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review breaks the weaknesses of Shanghams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr Shandisgam" "" "affirms a mistake" "" "or was it a" "" "Freudian" "" "speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, to which country walk the sovereign rights of the city in Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government of the government, the statements of Mr Shandisgam are of severe importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do they defend their military service, only do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay bills to invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink payroll?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">If the journal Journey of a Decade to the Bejahung, Singapore is and always was a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This phrase seems to have angry a lot of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We always were a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "the defense of the country," "" "etc." "", "but that is not quite true." ""</seg>

<seg id="1745">Then, on my clarinet, the standard answer is followed: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature." many Canadians cook maybe inwardly against anger, if they are held for Americans, but don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1768">First, being referred to as "nice" means to be more efficient - like the good-natured, gentle, but portable insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has a very Canadian coler).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really were a nation of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, meaning unobtrusive and uninteresting and no attention to earn.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This may be something good if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, away from the things happening around one around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, a major achievement of Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness that I join with my American friends.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, inspecial about how it behaves with the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at the videos of the video that relates to some of the political issues that have been pursuing in Thailand for the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" possibly relate to the drafted section 44 of the provisional constitution, which grant an absolute decision-making by the commander-in-Chief of the Healer Convention on important national issues.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup in the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts have warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video even shown how people are thrown into a black case before they put them into an interval camp, another problem case.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way to the migrants that cross Europe or Latin America, some places for their hospitality are known.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, he is on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is headed by a 59- year-old Mexica, a small woman with a corals-pink glint and gold-colored earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born there in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians that are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with rams, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the court there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - still hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept out on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It wants to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick, they buy them drugs that they can not pay, they massaged them with a balm that extracted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mum Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, which has a yoghurche) posed with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make normal their first stop in South America and move towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a famous name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitian and Africans often travel alongside the circuit and that, Africans are already talking on Whatsapp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his waymarks, Michelet lived in Brazil previously and worked as building workers on building the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the ticket ticket after Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "" "answers he smiles." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells that their guests often send their text messages to greet her or to report her over the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the impulse of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa but their guests have brought her both chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps here very well known, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead-end street leads to Jesús Valencia.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valencia and his family were invited to their families in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets will be sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he tells." "" "I experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tape comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he had flown out in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to prescribe money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for a accommodation and a Unknown, a single-hand side, offered him the roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the traveler reviews their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgically, because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother they fed them in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There's one of her daughter with African hair care that her has made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she would like her briefly.</seg>

<seg id="1962">On July 10th, the mobile users received a cell notification in the Tianshan District of the City of Urumqi, in which she points the District government to install a monitoring app, called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>

<seg id="1966">"" "in the communication of the police that the app could determine the sources and distribution of terrorists, together with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "" "including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwane's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockages of pornographically websites, from online fraud, Trojan and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>

<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports of digital censorship in China is mostly concentrated on the experience of users in the larger cities of the East and South, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, oppressive ethnic minorities like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To rest unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and monitoring measures as well as routinous Internet isolation.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"" "the media outlets" images from "" "" images from the China "" "" (on the one of the similar ones in China published, showed photos of a checkpoint where the police indiscriminate the residents at optional, whether they have installed the monitoring app. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian are certain that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint using a device without this software, they could be detained by up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances needed for older people.</seg>

<seg id="1984">"images from the area of China" (on the basis of the one of this one) published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the mechanical requirement of a Windows operating system and gives full access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become an electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang are potentially a reaction to the directives of the city party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and associated facilities including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordani Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of the LGBTQ + Community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken from Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends much of his time indoors; sometimes he strolling to his canvas, even to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What you can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine lips to discover.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel had fulfilled his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had to flee from their village to Palestine in which they had lived as felicyees (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and have questioned their well-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deal with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only find in his hometown Amman Relative, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his mind by borders, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he is not open to the US, he grants a special aversion against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones to do anything with his identity as the Palestinian fledged of the second generation - so he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and never before in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own living circumstances so" stressed Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I am saying," "" "I am a man" "" "while he poured into two cups in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is foreseen for Muslims from dawn to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanic law also states that the public intake of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sensing called Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the doping coffee and the Schwaden of Kent-cigarette in the nose is primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"" "" "" "sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when looking into neighboring countries." ""</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is avoidable to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled one appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the jordani branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontshop Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press review in the Islamic coalition of DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was "precisely" because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many employers also say the involvement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism that question the established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila the Jamaican people considered" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "", "which continues to stand" "" "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is likely to not simply be silky rhetoric but actually a clear crystallizing reality in Jordan that appears in Hdaibs's work to seem clear.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards to be Leibe by reformed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre-ital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently crushed unfamiliar woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years Jordan has increased the number of 'honorary posts' - the unofficial exterior left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">In 2016, human Rights Watch recognized its climax. however, the number of Honorary Consulate reached its zenith in 2016; however, Jordan is still lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who tried to rode the victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the crime counterinsurgency in 1954 women who are exposed to risk-familial violence, "to be held at indefinitely time in prison," and for her release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee by the family necessary that the woman will have nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, even to shy away from topics, which in his country long as tabu gold.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib takes out that his work is political, however, is that he is his music, which is full of explicit onslaught on sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">To me politics was dragged, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed, Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs which are in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled" "" "Santandano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and any other is it too." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get what you want "- whether belief or non-belief, heterosexuality or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly any one speaks in Jordan regarding the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been sharply censored up until in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Burordani Onlineprogram Roya to later notice that his comments were razed from the context, rebranded and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was loaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires open to the Arab LGBTQ + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals are not talking to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuit, a poet of the eighth century, who is still in mind today thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: when Abu Nuove, who was to work later on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century openly could write about homosexuality, why can Jordan ians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks the freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Israeli intelligence service took several former government-government and members of the Department of Lecturer, with the rationale, they had expressed criticism in social media critical about the problems linked with deep-rooted corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given that the concert of Hdaibs thinks only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan ians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has drilled Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it is Hdaib - consists of slow, depressive and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the jordani society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreams not only dreams of bringing his work up to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "experience them" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will engage with the help of music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading unitions, and in artificial kind. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib will continue on and consequently also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the neuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">We suspected that there is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory implies that the festivities, the drums and the dancing over more than one thousand years have been handed over and from a time, in the armies from the West Japan to marched in the northeast, to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi into the knees.</seg>

<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more normaly in the experienced hands of hairdressers that can make these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the paper" "" "love message" "", "which has published the international online magazine" "" "Tea After Twelve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here in the framework of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who have the chance to offer, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the foundation of Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the foundation of Bogota por la Republicliación (letters to reconciliation) that young people have taught letters to write letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently her country was a place of a historic event, and they wanted to make their part in it: after years of talks, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces Columbian), which forms the slump of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signatories of the peace agreement as such that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombian, there is a long way to speak of a real reconciliation, and of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warfare, which have lived for many years in illegal camps, have been exposed to rhetoric rhetoric and carried their arms around the clock, have now to be integrated into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred against guerriers, has to record them in their ranks and assist them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians have joined together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love message to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back into the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerilla of guerilla - which should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for letters to reconciliation was created in the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian was the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi that was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people who love to write on Valentine's Day for thousands of love letters, but those who need to forget it much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told on to share his love with people this year, which in the most urgent way.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse from a war history to a common history of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far the campaign was collected in more than 2000 letters.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i have never thought that someone would forgive me. '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogota traveled in the camp to give letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC, as they had done before, to countering the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive precepts, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings can go through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between," told the political knowledge of Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a employee of the Governors of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrillas.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the 'Cambuches' (a kind of hut, in which the guerilla live), I saw a guerilla that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to take part, because next to him on the bed, there was a MGL-pomegrance, a deadly weapon in the rimp flaccid.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I spoke it nevertheless and asked," "" "hello, what do they just make?" "" "he answered," "" "I reply to a letter I wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so nice, so I reply to it. "then I suddenly walked the tears about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegrance.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, I was sorry to be all the years of fidelity of this fighter and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of hunger. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there that waits with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Up to now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">The prelude came students and some leaders of the FARC to a panel discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students grew up all over as already war and the FARC had already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leader of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and provided insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how the social injustice of the State on the whole Colombian people have experienced, we can contribute to shaping our society more equitable.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a target of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard heard and had no voting right now, and to realize that people whom I often saw as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings were caused by their life circumstances and their environment, was very painful to me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the land lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage, can teach us a little and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesy that after disarmament peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as it gives inequality, hunger and a lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack the weapons and to protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we are now putting the FARC to the peace, to a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong to - all who rise from a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring victims, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are actually distracted, Myrian González tells, researchers for gender issues in Paraguay. "there are various indications and reports, which, however, do not even accumulate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the available numbers are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 the District council had 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads found in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads dealing with domestic violence at the peace courts. also here 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads said 40% of women found they physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychic misconduct.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguan women's ministering in Ana Baiardi, only a few of these criminal offences are actually shown. "on any woman who will not be refunded in Paraguay because of psychic misaction will come 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "every woman who will be refunded because of physical distraction, come two women who do not," "" "declared it at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not an own criminal law, the prosecution authorities may not document how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days dies a woman due to violence.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a legal system that does not stop anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name to him all of her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning they didn't want it, but then after. this should always repent them.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos. but for two years she bore psychological violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognisable the most severe:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would become the victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that the only women are happening to be fooled because they deceive themselves by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name written, she wrote posts on facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks throughout their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to concede that his behaviour has also been a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen out of Carlos for so long and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least one certain fellow to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which does not originate from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner she negotiates her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo te CREO (" "" "I think" "" ") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case all started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner even managed to convince them that it was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against its former partners who developed into an inconsistent legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2532">Thus, the law-text was altered in some points in order to also win the parliamentarians for the law that feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions are paved, which are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had been planned, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which have to present the victims of violence themselves, if they just want to report only the display and wish to receive a safe accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the omanic authorities have closed the independent Arab-speaking paper Azamn because of its coverage of corruption in the Sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison, where he wiped a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editor of Azamn, Ibrahim al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed in court, but came later again.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power since he had placed his father, Said ibn Taimur by a state coup.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important branches in the country: Prime Minister, Defence Minister, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rule of sultans is marked by the persevering efforts of the security forces, particularly the domestic and human rights, including freedom of freedom, religious freedom, bloggers and other activists, to intimidate and detained.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities maintain peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and prevent citizens, also activists, to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the Azamn newspaper, its closure and detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent magazine, in which since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, who was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016, published an article entitled "high-ranking parties of the judiciary," it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high-level officials in judicial decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, Member of the Board of Directors, was charged from the ISS before the special department and was arrested on his arrival by the security guards.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS participated in the deputy chief editor at Yousef Al-Haj who acts as an editor-in-chief.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was closed at unspecified time after the Minister of Foreign Minister had given the statement that "publishing and spreading the newspaper on any way, including online, from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016 the first hearing took place in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court condemned three journalists to prison guards and ordained the final closing of the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were judged both among others due to disorder of public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "underexcavation of the press of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was also found guilty of violation of a ban and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines at the level of each 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year professional ban on the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a prison sentence of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after having use "an information grid to spread material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a bail was set up at the altitude of 5000 omanic Rial (13 000 US dollars) and he was already released on 22 August 2016 in the event of judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Court of Appeal said to Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, condemned Al-Haj a year and Al-Maamari to six months imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 imprisonment of his six-month imprisonment sentence in mash. al-Haj continues to prison his prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Court of Appeals also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information, the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the court to resume Azamn, the newspaper continues to be suspended even before attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information received a statement by which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed another statement, in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister asked himself another time against the decision of the Appeal Court to permit the publication of the newspaper again.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman has been violated in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For further violations, such as closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the prolonged closing of Azamn and the imprisonment of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the regulatory authorities are still not prepared to end the comprehensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj promptly and unconditionally free;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with permission</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing segment, which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research on site: for example, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists, while building own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrior is Director of the centralist in the Centre for research of Infectious Disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew in Lusaka in the 1990s, especially as the AIDS Epidemic's first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Sambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he researched himself on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as an individual).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrior RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samic national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Furthermore, I have just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">AGA: what do you think about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only set solutions that have been developed somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being mine.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">AGA: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is she adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to go back or come here, because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">AGA: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">AGA: how big do you think is the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is a need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer science, big data, research of outer space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed of doing things, and the complicated access to scientific expertise that represent here challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines article make available only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producer change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine, reports about solutions for environmental issues around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton was born in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its enterprise offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant, cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was carried only by his own imagination and the question how many salads were able to get boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he remarked that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only intended for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green ton or undulate leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more plants such as cereals or cartels. because of these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security concerns the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">Being a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still breed salad, but he does not need any longer, since his work is continually increasing by ever more constraints.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is like being in a river a rock" "" "rock" "" "to keep the pumped." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go too far at Salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before judgment, no one can breed any more of a new salads, because all features already patented. "he is thus doing as good as possible and tries to raise those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Center ISS have bred red Römersalat of the variety Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there, it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector would originate and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "" "Open-Source" "" ") is inspired by the movement for free" "" "open source" "" "software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into being to ensure that some plant species and antigens are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently available for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative, in short of Ossi, US-breeders can commit themselves to others that others would be able to use seeds free of them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others to cross their seed to breeding their seed, and it's not immediately outfit - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerized Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member, Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play him a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stressed that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, the latest examples of the disappearing of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer are announced that in August and September 2016, should also know that the way it is cultivated on farms, should also know that the way that this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "dietary sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to tailor-made seeds to other seeds. thus, its action is in contrast to patent-good and plant-features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supply is jeopardised, since the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material, which thus always shrinks.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in their doctoral thesis with genetically variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about one-third of all Kartottenfeatures is protected as intellectual property, making it either not or only difficult for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are still no such estimates, but experts like Luby suspect that massaging plants like wheat is patented in a bigger scale as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are being cultivated so bred that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those, through which their taste or colour improved up to such due to which they maintain in particular environments and threats like pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder by becoming more and more patents. genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Specherin Carly Scaduto is that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial to monsantos activities. with a total of four Genbanks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company stands for the preservation of genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that the intellectual property of other breeders" "", "as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varietops innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent is up." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection inhibits innovations, but promotes it, by providing the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait until a patent expired, it certainly does not support innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to be able to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and still should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor the money for such formations, and moneatables are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton goes to the concept of patently, plant features: "we do not create the features themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form the plants themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is still another important aspect of crop-breeding: "who chokes a variety, and also breed his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large panties and monocultures, which are needed for their cultivation in fashion jewellery, which breed in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just gentamable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium sized enterprises (such that are moving to international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding, or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton looks for his breed garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder by the Avoid of plant patent products would be innovative: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than the enterprise.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still, the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On weekends, the Egyptian Government stacked the website of the Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step sharply criticized and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">That of the Network for Human Rights Information abides in spite of this attack and the removal of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities which should defend the law in this part of the world and to give victims a voice so it has never been so difficult to overcome these goals in order to overcome the block and not give up. we insist that our task will continue to fulfil.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites, such as blown the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking edition of Huffington Post and that from Qatar coming network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web pages to the victims like. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic, https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI there is no access to Egypt's blog and human rights research, Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columnists and articles that he does not write to availability websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, which he was built to circumvent the censored apparatus of the Egyptian government, even target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, which is native to the blog of the ziadas blog, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video like the police exerted physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada voiced to the block by the government and reflected, what this means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to block is very old, but has given priority in the era of Abdelineae al-Sisi; and even if the block of blogs might not be significant for the world, it is however for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has managed to give me the feeling of a siege of siege; a arrest, a attempted murder, a attempted murder, subloading of the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I was not in vain. in other words, my words have an effect, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I took advantage of it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now however, after having blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mute go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the block of providers, which was possible through the transformation of internetworks and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how to offer the block of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice suggests the purpose of the government to block and filter content and filter access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation in addition will be exacerbated that the censors decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed before the court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro at war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers reported in whole Brazil with bleak headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old in school," Because of the second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro have been murdered, "Diebe smoked pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Marine and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the powers of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice called for the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these are commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">Thus, for detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on 16 August, "This is not normal" in which they announced, a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city now will be published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex disruption, etc. all, but what happens by the civilised standard and what happened in Rio is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as a journalist do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor's editor, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a military resting in a country that does not recognize war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that it provides information from the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war rate, if he is distorted, can also be used, atrocities the police which only shoots and then ask questions to cover.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police, whose objective is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist of Cecília Oliveira on the other hand, describing the violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility in the police to account.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, clarification and historical and self-confident neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the Mordrates per federal state, Rio on No. 16," "" "writes them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company of South America that emphasizes such as Cecília, repeated the safety policy of the state for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security measures also belonged to the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the federal state of the country in 2003 by using a massive police officers to conquer a Favela and to make a unit permanently there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a withdrawal of violent deaths. for several years, the UPP, however, has led to several reports of rails and repressions against poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under attack.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux from one of his articles from the year 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not adopt the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">Besides legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also moves to serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls upon the state to use means and ways that are typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civil is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for "collagen damage."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War to or her, fact is that inhabitants of the Favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week ago it is now that the police overlends the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit-seller died as a result of shots who had donated the police out of a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume it, based on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre was practiced by Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013 they were under siege controlled areas outside of Damascus under siege, which led to them that inhabitants are dependent on local people or on tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of experience, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counterparty, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own mushrooms as "life-saving food source."</seg>

<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died, and about 70 were injured due to the forest fires of the 15th and 16th October. this led to the fact that the government called out solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state period.</seg>

<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 firebursts that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages.</seg>

<seg id="2875">Exactly at this time, Asharaf Barati is a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Asia-istan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say it at that time, she knew that she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn, the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the chimney.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban ruined for her hatred towards the Hazara Taliban were getting closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a couple of years in a cohesion. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wages, and went in Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and sluggish sacks with mortar, which were more difficult than he himself, to make his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "I remembered Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the jobsite, where we worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we cleared nylon in front of the open windows, so that we won't get refreshed at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf gave his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "" "" "after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application, Asharper 2002 came to Italy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food to the needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers, but it is also true that the conditions, the asylum seekers in the country are desastrous." ""</seg>

<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unadulthood helped Asharaf to liberate himself out of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having done various work in the building industry several years, Asharaf tasted his entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>

<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of the Afghans companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>

<seg id="2920">But Asharafs goals range far beyond the Italian Gastronomy and the retail, and aim back to the land which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Neuro-Report is an international snapshot, the challenges, victories and emerging trends in worldwide interneties shows</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian Parliament has reviewed a draft law which foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must use to take advantage of social networking within six months after successful legislation on the authority of the authority under specification of their full name as well as identification number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed this step could be sentenced to six months of prison or the withdrawal of a sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by sixty parliamentarians, is currently the legislative and constitutional committee in the Parliament, and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">May, another deputy proposal to be introduced in the harsh penalties for insulting the president or a high officials would be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="2937">"" "" "" "under Egyptian law the insults of the President as well as state institutions is already strained. however, under the proposed proposal, such an action would be punished with prisons and fines, thus right-wing of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "furthermore, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been at risk for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who took photographs on 13 August 2013, while he demonstrated violence against demonstrators, who demonstrated military coup against the President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, just like more than 700 protest participants, who were arrested in the same incident, four years in prison on a court.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently his heared was postponed to 20 May, because the prisons of human rights groups had failed to bring the accused of the prison into the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty on account of one, so many human rights groups agree, hypoload of others arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case a penal court in Giza spoke the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage on pro-Morsi seat block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya place in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the penalties of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="2949">The document released on 21 April on the website of Nawaat, casts a light on how the presidential term plans to support the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the disclosure of his sources under specification of article 11 of the Tunisian press, which reensures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he entered the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China compel the users of social media to submit your ID-ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new provisions of the Information Council of the People's Republic of China, users need social media in China to write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that the registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">The analyst suspect that through the elimination of anonymous comments in entertainments within social networks shall be achieved. it is still unclear how the authorities apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese European citizens have proposed resolutions in social media to enforce these regulations only in order to protect the bourgeois journalism and its independence.</seg>

<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey blocks the website completely. it is thus, besides China, one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>

<seg id="2968">Following this week, the British Government is in the midst of targeted consultation with increased surveillance systems that would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install backdoor programs to decode the data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But the government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies on the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
