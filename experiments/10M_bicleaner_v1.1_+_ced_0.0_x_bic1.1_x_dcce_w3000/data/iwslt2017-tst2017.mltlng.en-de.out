this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone had heard of Edward Snowden , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA had illeg@@ ally heard illeg@@ ally from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this , he describes a catastrop@@ hic US intelligence surgery , where the CIA has literally dra@@ fted dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if this sounds crazy you can read it .
it is an incredible history .
but do you know who the chapter failed ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has been established against R@@ isen and asked him to call its innate sources .
in this turn he became a symbol for the patterns of the government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to judge and to defeat journalists .
according to the first constitutional claim , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ te they give .
so when the government was anch@@ oring in R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something happened something exceptional .
suddenly , although they had for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in time electronic monitoring the re@@ porter and the sources can be hidden more and less .
instead of failing to fail and withdraw the statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and in this way , the investig@@ ator shall be concerned , without his consent , his phone @-@ wise secret ,
just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his loan appointment , and even travel documents with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence which they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and Ris@@ ens said source .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised at his turn to protect wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much conscious of their work than secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we set up the press work that is to be protected by the first constitutional record because the government has more and more opportunities to pick up all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the technology of the government allows to byp@@ ass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed they are able to contact us from the moment they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in evidence .
today , there is a communication software which has not yet been written when R@@ isen wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today released by the Freedom of the Press Foundation at which I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only the relevant Agency has access .
so the government cannot proc@@ ure any more information , and many of the information they request would not be available in advance .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are becoming ever new sp@@ y technologies that thre@@ aten us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is up to us to ensure that not only technology operators such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the talk about abnorm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers wants to report and be reported by crowded hospitals . or the next environmental mit@@ worker , the alarm proposes to contaminated water from f@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ In@@ sider that warns us from the next financial crisis .
nevertheless , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the greatest data le@@ ck of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rei@@ chs and he@@ ark@@ ing &#91; is &#93; hidden in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness to mention a statement . &#93; this week we were published by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents located in Panama &apos;s law firm Mos@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents will give you a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we really see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister is res@@ igned .
also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad Brief@@ k@@ ast@@ en@@ Companies in Tax hav@@ ens .
it is claimed to have a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend from children &apos;s plant@@ ations , a famous cell@@ ists .
now , there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people outside there , who are waiting for the next release , and for the next contained documents .
now it sounds like the P@@ lot of an agency &apos;s or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we take care of what ?
but the truth is , if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all paying their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations have been phenomenal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens to be used by some few of them to hide and vei@@ ling -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people appearing this whole world very confusing , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine it as a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who behind those bones .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far , which occurred in these revelations , that sc@@ andal .
well , it is not that there are no wealthy Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but by principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has fewer American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US states less information needs to specify less information to create a firm than to get a reference guide .
this type of in@@ consistency in the US has allowed employees to cover school teachers , school children .
it has frau@@ d@@ sters to f@@ lick particularly an@@ esthe@@ tic investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it work ?
so we sent a co@@ vert investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 An@@ wal@@ ts@@ companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself a African Minister , who wanted to bring down money to the United States in order to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ vel it really that all until a lawyer by our investig@@ ator made suggestions about how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre @-@ meetings . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course anyone has been handed over to him . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
this is not about a single lawyer , who has made our secret investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single leader , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a secure optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot has started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years we have seen preliminary impulses for greater transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron in the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has grown in central reg@@ isters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliament@@ arians , but it does not make progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the business to stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more transparency is not good for the business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit themselves to end this kind of in@@ consistency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally end the in@@ consistency , which now still allows this type of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
that is the story , as I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted almost once and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made straight a road@@ trip all the land . afterwards , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , Mann !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him . he says that he would go to the peace Cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to land the trunk of a ma@@ iden !
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself saying , &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uh , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was then in bed , I gaz@@ ing at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I do here ?
a game of wild in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sh@@ out on toe toes at the door , and my dormit@@ ory door closed .
but he was not mad .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he had bought from me , today depends in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood than strangers , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to lodge people on my air mattress , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate is drawn up and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it , anxiety in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I forgot how we could earn anything . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air rat@@ chet and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et@@ ts tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest and the door went to the castle , star@@ red Brian and I remember .
did we just discover that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into rolls .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make such a business concept .
so we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website where people can post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , the kind of rooms , their doors you pass when you visit .
on the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business which allows strangers to sleep in the apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children all have learned that foreigners are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you think about the things you can do well . we could be designed .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create through design immense confidence , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a tasting , which degree of confidence we were doing .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ locked cell phone of your left seat .
this quietly an@@ flug of panic that you are now feeling -- -- is exactly what hosts sense when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the remote cell phone of a foreig@@ ner in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason can our company exist .
only once , who has actually Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you announce the Office of the President on Twitter ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbour would have imagined only once with his name ; if he had told where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 ratings . all of them say : &quot; he can really hold very well vers@@ ed mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conceived feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative assessments .
ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest have given their evaluations before we created them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probable it is that men trust each other depending on how similar they are to age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less trust we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ disp@@ arity .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by means of jud@@ gements .
if one has less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation sti@@ cking similarities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
moreover , we drove that trust is dependent on how much you expect from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if one tells too little , like for example &quot; hi ! , &quot; one gets rather no answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell us a lot , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to produce this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects you should write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with what we had not reck@@ oned was the large amount of people who were more than willing to cover these prejudices .
here you can see how many people are eligible for our offer .
you can see three things .
first , incredibly good luck .
second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been covered before .
for us the business is just very good .
of course , there are also times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have been un@@ authorised parties or dwell@@ ers .
hosts have no guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it hur@@ ts if I just think of it .
the disappointment that one hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
fortunately , the total of the 123 million @-@ medi@@ ated nights had only a fraction the problem .
because people trusted each other rightly .
when trust works , it can be wonderful .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host continued to go to hospital .
he even don@@ ate blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to be fil@@ tered due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real Guardian Angel standing in one &apos;s life although they do not know at all .
you drive your own car into the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a bite ass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay runs .
but these relations behind the Pure Love campaign are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled about this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money @-@ transactions together ?
it is a business trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now just a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing does not do justice to justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade , human relations promises .
people place a part of it open and that changes everything .
when you travel today it is compatible with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
what if travels would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you have visited , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and to show a pub @-@ pent@@ ine district by which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to make apartments of the ground for sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would share the thought of sharing ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that the government belonged ,
were residents offered . students who were in search of a lead ,
were given to people whose children were moved . there have been incub@@ ator programs ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreig@@ ner or even host .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was attached to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was there even before .
there were already similar websites .
so why did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome profound prejudices .
I find that amaz@@ ingly ,
quite overwhelming .
I must contem@@ plate each time a red Maz@@ da on me continues .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design for soon .
thanks .
what do you think if you are watching me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or sup@@ pressed , subjected to bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ist ?
or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think , most of them would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslims : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee owner -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I have decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ting myself .
no , not as a homo@@ sexual man , like some of my friends , but as mus@@ li@@ in . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear .
my feminist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why are you oppressed you ? &quot;
the som@@ ber was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and with the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have rest@@ led with the Koran .
I read it , thought upon , challenged in question , doub@@ ted and believed in finally .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Koran .
the beauty of Rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to tears .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone percei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow I love ?
it feels that way .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian dream . &quot;
then came this terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had my breakfast , looked back on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ il@@ feedback &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes in buildings , people split from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my Sho@@ ck turned into revol@@ t quickly .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; T@@ bom@@ bed Mecca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
not only my country has been attacked , but in the N@@ u related me the acts of others by a civil society in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and start studying .
I remember as we went to silence -- so deep it went out into my seat , and I feared for the first time to be recognized as mus@@ li@@ in .
we pulled this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vigil@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead to well lighted areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fal@@ si@@ ls you not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims get together to pray .
and again the warnings : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque might be a goal . &quot;
I saw an extensive reporting .
the feelings were , understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who have kept outdoors for Muslims , and sm@@ ashed away .
there really was Bran@@ dan@@ es on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have swe@@ pt the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually listen to people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it says Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the United States .
there is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor can be seen as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our one only holds under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but an important organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , er@@ sth@@ and and Olympi@@ ad .
will the closing of mos@@ ques America make more secure ?
there may be perhaps a few parking spaces free but not the terror stop .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith of tolerant and larger civil participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington D.C. , DC recently told : people are indeed not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , one has determined that he begins online . as a first , the person can make a brain @-@ washing , even by their family to make the person believes that the person is , the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ind their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor , or of faith .
if we want to prevent radicals , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group such as the IS explains their brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to her imagination , if you recognize them as representatives of 1,@@ 6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups claiming their ideology reasons in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if you have a look at them , they do not drives them what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets you read these things in the scriptures .
a outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought to the silence and said to her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , she would only bring them into trouble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing inspired and something that gave sense to her anger , she was a prime goal for the instrument@@ alisation through extremis@@ ts that ple@@ dged to a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Ima@@ m once again set the connection to God and her church .
instead of accused them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
it was an impression of how the Islam@@ ophobia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , of our thoughts of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , pass at least three things .
we do not accept an authorit@@ arian government system , con@@ formance and prejudices .
a study reveals : if people pres@@ cribes messages , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they voted against Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you &apos;re looking when the mood against Muslims go upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two constitu@@ encies .
so , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public in order to allevi@@ ate the foundations of a free society , which has rational and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early warning .
we might sense it as the first but the toxic air of fear gives us all .
in assignment of collective blame , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was at the dental Department , tal@@ kers , much promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is out of my age , such a se@@ ated young man has become ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne with her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just as is the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an which was in the afternoon when he posted expressions of statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he flew eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so go back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or were we staying safe at home ?
we said it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove in silence , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes came out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thanks himself and was welcome to our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who were come to attack us , but to assist us .
in this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ced .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number sure ?
or you will join the ones that mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a ner@@ v .
but I ask myself , what do you say those who perhaps claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker in with deep holes , work in a cl@@ assy bra@@ in@@ factory , so an exception rather than the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , fool you not . I am perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it allows .
when one looks at Muslims around the world , and I did it with the greatest ever performed study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for cra@@ fting , is near to become a billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats .
before air @-@ parcel registration into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France was built live in front of an audience a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
through connec@@ t@@ ying , air devices reach high speed and acceleration in the nar@@ ro@@ wer room .
they can also build up @-@ to @-@ day resili@@ ent structures .
you have learned to bear the bur@@ dens to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to aut@@ on@@ om , it must be collec@@ tiv@@ ating where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a members of our lab@@ s .
there are no external cameras .
each flight has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , comp@@ ut@@ ations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are on the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
one airplane that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
as other Star@@ r@@ whis@@ ers it is efficient in for@@ wards flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most Star@@ r@@ ists it can float , and has a large benefit at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a downside .
a restriction of ta@@ tre@@ mor is that they respond sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often introduce basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter .
for example , one such question would be : what is the smaller number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are about as machines with a thousand movable parts known to hurt you .
several decades ago , pilot @-@ controlled aircraft could fly away , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
unfortunately we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the mon@@ o @-@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest TV @-@ device . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ als , no further actu@@ ator or inspec@@ tors , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens inside the inner life a lot , so that it can be stable and can move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm for the ta@@ d star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right correctly .
the chance to throw it right when all of me is low , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ o is an exercise in mer@@ ging , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symm@@ etrical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his orientation .
thus he receives the au@@ gment @-@ bearing ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is directed or even how it rotating .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ers .
some is conceivable in models , the rest will be learned directly at flies .
let &apos;s see this on .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ru@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a bit wrong -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls off , electronics or a cordless -- can fly the machine even if limited .
we will now demonstrate that we do a half of air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took dressed Micro Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alisation and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine as it wants to become a flying lamp at Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the salary is in the development and the creation of creation .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures allowing them to form a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
just 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galaxy , two black holes are becoming more and faster , they turned their mass three prob@@ es in a tenth of a tenth of pure energy in pure energy .
this short moment hur@@ ried her bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they do not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into the space @-@ time Ge@@ der itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
then we arrange the events initially tim@@ ed .
1,3 billion years ago , there was a multi @-@ cell life on earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ ces , people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group decided particularly courageous -- R@@ ai We@@ iss of MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- a giant laser det@@ ector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people realized them as a crazy genius , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser inter@@ fer@@ ometer - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of LIG@@ O could considerably increase the efficiency performance enormously improved .
therefore , it is called Advanced LIG@@ O .
early September 2015 LIG@@ O was started for a last test run to clarify some smaller , persistent issues .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes through the earth .
you went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the par@@ ting from my To@@ d@@ ill father .
basically , it was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their by observ@@ atories as LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ aching in the texture of space and time .
while passing the wave , the space and its entire contents are stretched into one direction , and into the other hand .
to illustrate , lec@@ tur@@ ers lead in courses for rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a true al@@ ber@@ ing dance .
&quot; stretching and storage , stretching and bar@@ rage . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was expan@@ sive at the end of the waves and over@@ looks . the stretching of an average human was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means that 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 , one explained the LIG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre long laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about grav@@ itation
abra@@ sion Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are sin@@ ful and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott claimed , LIG@@ O is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial extracts , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite handy . because in this way you can create an image or a map of things by taking the light around you from multiple points .
in pots the other is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean to you very much :
the face of your child is approximately .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as sound and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now just Alice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob put it down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ sty Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can do with them no simple pictures of objects in space .
but by taking on changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wav@@ e@@ pattern in she@@ ds , we can hear the All literally .
the gravity of a loud one can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
S@@ H : two black , non @-@ h@@ ful holes , sounds easy : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circulation system with an additional key change . this sounds like a Wu @-@ Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu !
it is a kind of movement , engra@@ ved into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIG@@ O that : &#91; Sur@@ render of the noise &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows what to hear , this recognizes as a sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ f@@ acher sun mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your bl@@ ender .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , orbit each other one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces in front of them .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
therein lies the constant significance of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the space and the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not visible .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ tion stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes occur however at the core , which lies behind thousand kilometers of iron , carbon and silic@@ on .
we will never pass through , since these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it would explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the urine is vei@@ led through his own lights .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I &apos;m optimistic that there are all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we don &apos;t have any idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact LIG@@ O found equal in the first attempt things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this issue : Me : the kind of stars , which bring black holes , like LIG@@ O , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our arche@@ ological work .
LIG@@ O makes us a completely different perspective on events in space , at the origin of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now consists of being as bold as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ N , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the ro@@ ar and circle of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
because what could be more beautiful than the Ur@@ b@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say too &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before which I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it did me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared that I feared my fear .
my fear , talk to keep my social anxiety -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes which my life changed , on an un@@ expect@@ edly . it began with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; estimate , &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my beak @-@ ass . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the leap . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to play always with them whenever you call me for it . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say hello -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I felt very much .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has an intrigu@@ ing side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ Sa@@ gen for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a true dream job .
I am author . I think things off , you can get to live .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ire Television . I generate television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible to spread 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each show has hundreds of jobs that did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a TV broadcast@@ er may lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days of four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , three hours TV , three programmes , which are simultaneously in production , four episodes : know To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series run on each other on Thursday night .
all over the world my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so yet ob@@ last clean . I have to find time , really sty , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that around the world burn .
do you know who is still doing it ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I do not want to impress you with it .
I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say to you , so that all of you who work so hard , have a business or a classroom , take me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work so you understand that I don &apos;t just talk about computer and imagin@@ ative , and it is true when I say : I understand that there is no dre@@ aming in a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I get into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land from nothing .
it is like I set troops as if I put troops on a canvas .
as a result , you have a high sound , lying a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the buzz .
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
a buzz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums like a busy road , I could drive forever on her .
many people take when I declare them the buzz that I am writing to it , that writing was prepared for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the buzz -- when I began working with television production , when I began working and work and to work , build up and work , I discovered this thing , this buzz , this energy .
the buzz is more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the buzz is one drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a sums , you cannot strive for any other size than size .
the feeling that cannot be different than to seek size , no matter what price .
this is what you call the buzz .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is called genius .
maybe it is the ego .
maybe it is a fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the buzz .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not ask it to question .
to make a clear one : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more advanced boundaries , the more things are , the more things simultaneously , the more I write history , the more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land , which I was created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the high sound , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz .
I like this sums . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the sums .
am I only this buzz ?
and then the sums stopped .
revised , over@@ laid , exaggerated , burned .
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single work@@ tan .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mother will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; guess , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the children of a title .
you are baby @-@ titles .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the money was heard .
the sums of the engine is pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I did not love my job any more . the engine was off .
the buzz did not come back .
my money was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , penetr@@ ated weekends , no re@@ mor@@ als , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps , does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no money .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz , and the buzz was me .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
I know some may think : &quot; Heu@@ l You aus , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know you are doing what you work , one loves you to be a teacher , a banker , a mother , Bill Gates , one loves simply another and that gives one the buzz , when you knew the buzz , when the sums stops , who is it ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; was asking me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out to the outside , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mom that you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no saying no more than two things are aware of :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; estimate . &quot;
it calls no one else &quot; estimate . &quot;
when is this happened ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my cab@@ al , and here everything is changing my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we play and show their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and lack of sw@@ inging , I cannot do anything except to adjust .
I am focused .
I am quietly .
the land , which I was created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they do not exist anymore .
everything that exists is sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ xing and the song , in which it &apos;s going to get rid of , or whatever the girl wants to release in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and a energy balance comes in .
and not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sums come slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is soft , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the tot@@ als , but a buzz .
and now I feel like I &apos;d know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the buzz , the working @-@ room , the titan@@ ium @-@ sum@@ ables , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I &apos;m describing through programmes and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums is .
the sums are not strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the pleasure .
the real sums of money depends on love .
the buzz is the electricity that comes from lust .
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums ignor@@ es the pressure of the story , the over@@ estim@@ ating tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sums is simple and original .
the real sums of God is the voice in my ear , but perhaps he whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , a lot more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I am doing this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play is not enough to play as , as you work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer working at work as at home .
this approach is painful , because what a man prefer to be as being home ?
well yes , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them .
we go around in the garden , in front of and back , and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we fr@@ y silk bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always take a look after my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children tell me how to live and the buzz of the universe fills me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever ceased with the Games ?
you can also say it ! just say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amt .
you have probably right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they show up they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes I will replace a Mari@@ ak@@ et@@ le or K@@ eks .
and that my teenage daughter speak all 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everyone can take 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes by piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children ready to finish .
but 15 minutes are available !
my children are my wellbeing , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to have the money to have a place for the peace of mind .
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ,
about &quot; Games &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it out .
I am not perfect in it . I stick and I love . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more .
15 minutes a bit , why not get a total 15 minutes away ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the buzz came back in my spare time . the buzz seems to return if I do not work .
working not without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . she leads me to new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the buzz , but I do not love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the money , the money is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my buzz .
the buzz of life .
the sums of love .
the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful .
it is my s@@ nu@@ b that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the land , which I drive , the marathon , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz of life .
the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , be@@ ying , naked and new life @-@ feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things I bet you to live .
that belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks lovely .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke , or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustrating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very small ability for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgical surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
surely they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; woo@@ fers &quot; stimulation . thereby , one im@@ pl@@ ank an electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease , suffered from severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and heavy pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was guiding Ober@@ physician and worked day and night in the emergency .
often , I gave patients with sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that in sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mata the brain is floating and the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure increases .
in order to save life , one has to l@@ essen the sk@@ ull resistance .
but sometimes you have to remove a part of the infl@@ ated brain mass .
instead of throwing the infl@@ ated brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue to grow is comparable to very small children that are extracted from your families .
one has to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to flour@@ ish .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts he managed Jean @-@ François .
that looked at it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
maybe you still know from Bi@@ ologi@@ an lessons , that stem cells are in@@ mature cells , which can turn into any cell ty@@ p of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small neck of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we took a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells stopped differently .
they got slowly and after a few weeks they died even .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but did otherwise hold .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our large hir@@ n@@ rin@@ der@@ mis cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fo@@ etus they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but that is not so certain .
one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source , which enables brain healing .
this was what we had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to find a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingual area , and then the cells can cultivate exactly how it was Jean @-@ François
and they subsequently mark them to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step we r@@ hy@@ med them at the disposal of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ation transp@@ l@@ ant - Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we r@@ hy@@ m@@ ite these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we r@@ hy@@ m@@ ite the same cells in the sul@@ ated brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario r@@ hy@@ med up the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after several weeks she had completely disappeared , as if they were taken back home , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they disappear there .
in the second scenario we put an injury to and r@@ hy@@ med up the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells , which were r@@ hy@@ med .
the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we colored in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ?
so we set monkeys with a manual skill task .
you had to take food pel@@ lets from a tray .
they made them very well .
when they reached a stable weight level , we injured in the mot@@ orized cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen to people , they recovered spontane@@ ously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover by means of sculp@@ tural bra@@ in@@ isms . they are rec@@ u@@ perate to a certain degree , just as the monkey .
when we were sure the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side they see the monkey who reco@@ vering spontane@@ ously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not as accurate and not so fast .
now see , when we r@@ hy@@ med the cells r@@ hy@@ med up : the same monkey , two months after the im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can make them freezing and later use .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for instance with Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate them in humans .
I really hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal themselves .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can &apos;t need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms , in order to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : take a look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
first , it depends on the authorisation of the clinical trial .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it &apos;s useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
one must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment for everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality , but as the inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable ant@@ ness .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as Finance Minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that have been implemented in Greece .
in that moment , I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rising friends who would be repeated to me that democracy would change if anything would change anything .
in this place I would like to introduce an economic model for true democracy .
I ask you , along with me , to believe in believing that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save ourselves democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and defen@@ cel@@ tic democracy .
because without democracy our societies become dark , our future ble@@ ak and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently under threat to our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin summit paradox@@ es . &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the debt mountain ,
but only a few recognize his Twin @-@ Gem@@ ini .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is , however , to be anxious to invest there , where it could contribute to productive and income in which one could contribute to the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , there were invested 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars in the U.S. , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , jam , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars will sound like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars that at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the bor@@ row and pres@@ cribe the property prices .
in this way , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which are not reflected by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 yrs old in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low demand that feared that they don &apos;t invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who is out of fear , the prophecy of the arch could be true that his son would kill him when he grows ,
invol@@ un@@ tary the circumstances cause it to lead , that o@@ di@@ ans k@@ ills him .
this is my case with capitalism --
his extremely wor@@ wi@@ per art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and to finance all of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the earth .
so democracy is the solution ?
but before we continue . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the social form in which the open and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included naturally too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to this degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that they were the working arms and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they att@@ un@@ ed to them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vo@@ icing in questions of the state of government .
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long --
like a candle , which shines very bright , it is also quickly burned down .
however , our present @-@ liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens .
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was del@@ ine@@ ated on policy while the economy - the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our present democracies has been occurring since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two instead , by gradually emig@@ rated to politics and depri@@ ved them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like in the past ?
it is not about the de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because that one cannot be in the government today and still not in power , because the power from politics to the economy is dis@@ ed and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ ils with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which sustain@@ ably has the animals , of which it fe@@ eds , under@@ mined that they star@@ ve at the end .
it is similar to the economy that the politics has so far more can@@ cer@@ ated by the self @-@ causing economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated , the inequality rises , the overall economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are to be scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful the capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; go out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labor power and prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; will retain control so as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t really good .
the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and wast@@ age .
but there is a solution : the working arms create !
capitalism does it by replacing ni@@ ckel @-@ cat@@ chy by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation will be higher the twin , the wast@@ age and social conflicts deeper , just as I think -- coming in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to re @-@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democratic in an abnormal surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that makes the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth , will survive --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve the people and the people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it look like , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; of similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples soon .
in the area of companies : ask for a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a work place to the next , and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all incomes come from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no exchange of labour between investment and labour , no big gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no up@@ swing twin summit .
in the field of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference was proposed in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , particularly against the background of a unified policy and economy .
the world I describe you is at the same time liber@@ alism , in which they fav@@ ored privileged people , and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ally , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ ally .
but above all there is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar di@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we can decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said , Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry sw@@ mers as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies but also countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and so I am also completely un@@ ra@@ vel .
BG : in fact , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if one is not wir@@ t , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your lecture mentioned you Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you said very clearly what you can hold from the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the status of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most is playing , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic free zone .
in a sense if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles that of the England of the 19th century .
for -- don &apos;t remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development concerned .
what we can observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now prefer@@ able to do what the West has done in the 19th century , it smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance from the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I ah@@ ed that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to start with the euro area a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to adopt us from the com@@ plac@@ ency , and the persistent denial made that a massive ampli@@ fier line is going through the eurozone and continues to be driven by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity to be based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is correct to do . unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European group , continues to be the denial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system which is not viable , through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism into life , one may perhaps be able to delay a while , but when change happens , he happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as a Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he claims , he made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course , I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme in late February .
I believed there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions caused by the Eurozone .
they did not want to conc@@ ede that they had been a catastrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; neither from the Troika of creditors that imposed us this policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : in spite of all this , and despite the aggressive purpose of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro area comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , they will be demon@@ ic and destroying the European Union .
this will not be disastrous alone for Europe but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the way of a post @-@ modern 1930@@ s , which appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ arable for the future of Europeans , as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thanks a lot that you were at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ ocr@@ e minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy did hit three years ago .
Roy Price is a leader at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production facility of Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an id@@ ol@@ ish and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , tactics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very tough restruc@@ ture industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this curve .
this curve is the assessment of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and height shows how many shows will get this review .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows , the addic@@ tive , where after you saw a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not cause to fall on the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to under@@ offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
he makes more thoughts on the mean ou@@ ting , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon so doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk Roy Price .
he wants to make successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he is holding a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where everyone can watch everyone for free .
and if Amazon got something out for free , you have to feel right ?
millions of viewers see these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed when watching this shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you detect when to start the show when one p@@ auses , which parts you would be ski@@ pped or over@@ looks .
you collect millions of data to choose which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process this and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com for four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alpha House , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that many cannot remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- something beyond average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always searching for finding a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give to shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had together all the parts , they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the question is : what is happening here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed .
they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic decides that it should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years in statistics as back @-@ up .
you can optimize it by very powerful computer .
the Mind@@ est thing you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is somewhat terri@@ fying because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does someone here know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever be in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison in the United States and ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , will be decided whether one person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , in spite of the many data ,
not always the best results produced . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data sealed are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
2009 gave Google known that they can be predicted by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , predic@@ ts -- by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderfully well was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly no longer worked ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all of these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- on the workplace , in legal situation , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people un@@ thin@@ kable many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be circul@@ ated .
if you prefer to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
as a first , you specify this problem in its parts , so you can analyze the items ; as a broad set you put together the items to write a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help solve a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to comp@@ ose the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to sit down again , even if the information is incomplete , to then touch a good condition -- especially when it is a brain &apos;s brain .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else they would not have been capable of . but the decision how to put all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first as they we@@ t@@ ted to TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball , &quot; it is amazing . for decisions with a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- just here at this moment .
I will be able to leave it later with a technical demo .
so far I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them by something much cre@@ ased , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in this way , perhaps the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as being very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks to which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thanks lovely .
