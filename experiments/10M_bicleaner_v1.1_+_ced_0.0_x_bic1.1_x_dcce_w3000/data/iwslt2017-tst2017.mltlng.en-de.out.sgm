<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA had illegally heard illegally from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence surgery, where the CIA has literally drafted drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible history.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter failed?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been established against Risen and asked him to call its innate sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol for the patterns of the government, whistleblowers to judge and to defeat journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional claim, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mute they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was anchoring in Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 Risen lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something happened something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had for years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time electronic monitoring the reporter and the sources can be hidden more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing to fail and withdraw the statements, it could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And in this way, the investigator shall be concerned, without his consent, his phone-wise secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his loan appointment, and even travel documents with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence which they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and Risens said source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised at his turn to protect whistleblowers. but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much conscious of their work than secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblowers to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we set up the press work that is to be protected by the first constitutional record because the government has more and more opportunities to pick up all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed they are able to contact us from the moment they contact, rather than in the afterward, in evidence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there is a communication software which has not yet been written when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swartz, and is today released by the Freedom of the Press Foundation at which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only the relevant Agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot procure any more information, and many of the information they request would not be available in advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are becoming ever new spy technologies that threaten us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is up to us to ensure that not only technology operators such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The talk about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers wants to report and be reported by crowded hospitals. or the next environmental mitworker, the alarm proposes to contaminated water from flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider that warns us from the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the greatest data leck of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that Reichs and hearking [is] hidden in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer from Global Witness to mention a statement.] this week we were published by news about a leak of 11 million documents located in Panama's law firm Mosseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents will give you a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Moselle Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We really see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad BriefkastenCompanies in Tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed to have a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend from children's plantations, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now, there will be a lot of richer people outside there, who are waiting for the next release, and for the next contained documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of an agency's or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we take care of what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all paying their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations have been phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens to be used by some few of them to hide and veiling -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appearing this whole world very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it as a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who behind those bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far, which occurred in these revelations, that scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not that there are no wealthy Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states less information needs to specify less information to create a firm than to get a reference guide.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of inconsistency in the US has allowed employees to cover school teachers, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has fraudsters to flick particularly anesthetic investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 Anwaltscompanies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself a African Minister, who wanted to bring down money to the United States in order to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shovel it really that all until a lawyer by our investigator made suggestions about how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pre-meetings. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course anyone has been handed over to him. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">This is not about a single lawyer, who has made our secret investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leader, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a secure optimist, I see quite a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the past few years we have seen preliminary impulses for greater transparency, which concerns the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron in the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has grown in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentarians, but it does not make progress we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headfirms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the business to stand up and say:" "" "more transparency is not good for the business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit themselves to end this kind of inconsistency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end the inconsistency, which now still allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">That is the story, as I almost abducted almost once and in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made straight a roadtrip all the land. afterwards, he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I do not know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, Mann!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him. he says that he would go to the peace Corps, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to land the trunk of a maiden!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying, "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was then in bed, I gazing at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I do here?</seg>
<seg id="114">A game of wild in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, shout on toe toes at the door, and my dormitory door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me, today depends in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood than strangers, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To lodge people on my air mattress, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate is drawn up and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it, anxiety in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I forgot how we could earn anything. our apartment will stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air ratchet and Breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-Omeletts tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest and the door went to the castle, starred Brian and I remember.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discover that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make such a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented our Investors: "we want to create a website where people can post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, the kind of rooms, their doors you pass when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very consolation would invest in a business which allows strangers to sleep in the apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all have learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you think about the things you can do well. we could be designed.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create through design immense confidence, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a tasting, which degree of confidence we were doing.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocked cell phone of your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly anflug of panic that you are now feeling -- -- is exactly what hosts sense when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the remote cell phone of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once, who has actually Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce the Office of the President on Twitter?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour would have imagined only once with his name; if he had told where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 ratings. all of them say: "he can really hold very well versed mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest have given their evaluations before we created them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that men trust each other depending on how similar they are to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social predisparity.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by means of judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation sticking similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we drove that trust is dependent on how much you expect from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells too little, like for example "hi!," one gets rather no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell us a lot, such as:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- "--" -- "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle artworks in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we had not reckoned was the large amount of people who were more than willing to cover these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people are eligible for our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are also times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been unauthorised parties or dwellers.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have no guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it hurts if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the total of the 123 million-mediated nights had only a fraction the problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it can be wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host continued to go to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donate blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to be filtered due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real Guardian Angel standing in one's life although they do not know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive your own car into the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bite ass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay runs.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the Pure Love campaign are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled about this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money-transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a business trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now just a" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing does not do justice to justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, human relations promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of it open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today it is compatible with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travels would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you have visited, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and to show a pub-pentine district by which you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments of the ground for sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would share the thought of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that the government belonged,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were residents offered. students who were in search of a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were moved. there have been incubator programs,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreigner or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was attached to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was there even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Quite overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I must contemplate each time a red Mazda on me continues.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design for soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you are watching me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, subjected to brainwashing, a terrorist ist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think, most of them would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslims: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee owner -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-fanatics in,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to outing myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as musliin. I decided to wear the hijab, my headgear.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why are you oppressed you?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The somber was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and with the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have restled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought upon, challenged in question, doubted and believed in finally.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of Rhythmik sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow I love?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels that way.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came this terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I sat in my kitchen, had my breakfast, looked back on the screen and saw the word" "" "Eilfeedback" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes in buildings, people split from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My Shock turned into revolt quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I changed the TV channel and heard:" "" "Muslim terrorists" ""... "..." ""... "in the name of Islam" ""... "..." ""... "..." ""... "..." ""... "Tbombed Mecca!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only my country has been attacked, but in the Nu related me the acts of others by a civil society in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and start studying.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember as we went to silence -- so deep it went out into my seat, and I feared for the first time to be recognized as musliin.</seg>
<seg id="304">We pulled this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" "" "be vigilant" "", "" "" "lead to well lighted areas," "" "falsils you not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims get together to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "not on this first Friday, the mosque might be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw an extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were, understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who have kept outdoors for Muslims, and smashed away.</seg>
<seg id="311">There really was Brandanes on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>

<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "today we can actually listen to people:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it says Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">There is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor can be seen as a whole and a benign tumour one only holds under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the USA, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, ersthand and Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques America make more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be perhaps a few parking spaces free but not the terror stop.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith of tolerant and larger civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington D.C., DC recently told: people are indeed not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, one has determined that he begins online. as a first, the person can make a brain-washing, even by their family to make the person believes that the person is, the true Muslims, and anyone who abhind their behavior and ideology is a traitor, or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicals, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group such as the IS explains their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to her imagination, if you recognize them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claiming their ideology reasons in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you have a look at them, they do not drives them what they read in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets you read these things in the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought to the silence and said to her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, she would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">"" "" "" "nothing inspired and something that gave sense to her anger, she was a prime goal for the instrumentalisation through extremists that pledged to a solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam once again set the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accused them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an impression of how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, of our thoughts of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We do not accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals: if people prescribes messages, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they voted against Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you're looking when the mood against Muslims go upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public in order to alleviate the foundations of a free society, which has rational and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might sense it as the first but the toxic air of fear gives us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In assignment of collective blame, it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental Department, talkers, much promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is out of my age, such a seated young man has become?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as is the sister of Yusor, Razan which was in the afternoon when he posted expressions of statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He flew eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So go back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or were we staying safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We said it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove in silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes came out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanks himself and was welcome to our guests, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who were come to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudiced.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will join the ones that mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself, what do you say those who perhaps claim that you are a TEDTalk, a thinker in with deep holes, work in a classy brainfactory, so an exception rather than the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, fool you not. I am perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it allows.</seg>
<seg id="402">When one looks at Muslims around the world, and I did it with the greatest ever performed study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for crafting, is near to become a billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-parcel registration into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France was built live in front of an audience a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through connectying, air devices reach high speed and acceleration in the narrower room.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build up-to-day resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to bear the burdens to deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to autonom, it must be collectivating where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a members of our labs.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, computations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are on the highest level. for example," "" "Start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">One airplane that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">As other Starrwhisers it is efficient in forwards flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most Starrists it can float, and has a large benefit at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of tatremor is that they respond sensitive to turbulence like wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the device doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often introduce basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">For example, one such question would be: what is the smaller number of mobile parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are about as machines with a thousand movable parts known to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Several decades ago, pilot-controlled aircraft could fly away, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unfortunately we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the mono-inner, the mechanically easiest TV-device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No clapping, hinges and cross-ruals, no further actuator or inspectors, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, happens inside the inner life a lot, so that it can be stable and can move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm for the tad starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The chance to throw it right when all of me is low, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the mono is an exercise in merging, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the augment-bearing ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is directed or even how it rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is conceivable in models, the rest will be learned directly at flies.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see this on.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they act like a high-performance quadrucopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a bit wrong -- a engine or propeller falls off, electronics or a cordless -- can fly the machine even if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we do a half of airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took dressed Micro Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localisation and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine as it wants to become a flying lamp at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the salary is in the development and the creation of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures allowing them to form a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">Just 1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are becoming more and faster, they turned their mass three probes in a tenth of a tenth of pure energy in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment hurried her brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they do not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into the space-time Geder itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Then we arrange the events initially timed.</seg>
<seg id="476">1,3 billion years ago, there was a multi-cell life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, sauces, people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group decided particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a giant laser detector to look for gravitational-waves, which arise through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized them as a crazy genius, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser interferometer - gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could considerably increase the efficiency performance enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">Early September 2015 LIGO was started for a last test run to clarify some smaller, persistent issues.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collious black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting from my Todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied for 23 years of gravitational-waves from black holes and their by observatories as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a croaching in the texture of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">While passing the wave, the space and its entire contents are stretched into one direction, and into the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers lead in courses for relativity-theory often a true albering dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and storage, stretching and barrage."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was expansive at the end of the waves and overlooks. the stretching of an average human was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means that 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1, one explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Abrasion Kip Thorne, a co-founder, hunting for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are sinful and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claimed, LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial extracts, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because in this way you can create an image or a map of things by taking the light around you from multiple points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In pots the other is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean to you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as sound and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob put it down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dusty Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them no simple pictures of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by taking on changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least are the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wavepattern in sheds, we can hear the All literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity of a loud one can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-hful holes, sounds easy: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circulation system with an additional key change. this sounds like a Wu-Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement, engraved into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO that: [Surrender of the noise] Jemand, who knows what to hear, this recognizes as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-facher sun mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your blender.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the diest body in all, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 sones, orbit each other one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces in front of them.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the constant significance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a whole new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massertion stars in super-novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur however at the core, which lies behind thousand kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through, since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the urine is veiled through his own lights.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I'm optimistic that there are all things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we don't have any idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO found equal in the first attempt things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this issue: Me: the kind of stars, which bring black holes, like LIGO, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, age-old bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the Saurierknochen for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO makes us a completely different perspective on events in space, at the origin of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of being as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGN, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the roar and circle of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">Because what could be more beautiful than the Urbang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say too" "" "Yes!" "" "before which I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it did me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared that I feared my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, talk to keep my social anxiety -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes, my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes which my life changed, on an unexpectedly. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for inexplicable reasons all "estimate,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimate, I need milk for my beak-ass."</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the leap. and I said," "" "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I swear to play always with them whenever you call me for it. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say hello -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I felt very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side effect: only recently I understood that the "Yes" -Sagen for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a true dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things off, you can get to live.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creire Television. I generate television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible to spread 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show has hundreds of jobs that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV broadcaster may lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days of four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, three hours TV, three programmes, which are simultaneously in production, four episodes: know To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series run on each other on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so yet oblast clean. I have to find time, really sty, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that around the world burn.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you, so that all of you who work so hard, have a business or a classroom, take me seriously if I'm talking about work so you understand that I don't just talk about computer and imaginative, and it is true when I say: I understand that there is no dreaming in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work hard, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I get into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is like I set troops as if I put troops on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a result, you have a high sound, lying a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums like a busy road, I could drive forever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take when I declare them the buzz that I am writing to it, that writing was prepared for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began working with television production, when I began working and work and to work, build up and work, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the buzz is one drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you cannot strive for any other size than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that cannot be different than to seek size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what you call the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is a fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not ask it to question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear one: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more advanced boundaries, the more things are, the more things simultaneously, the more I write history, the more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I was created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overlaid, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single worktan.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mother will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "guess, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a title.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-titles.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the money was heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine is petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My money was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, penetrated weekends, no remorals, nothing delegating, a Titan sleeps, does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz, and the buzz was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know some may think: "Heul You aus, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you are doing what you work, one loves you to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, Bill Gates, one loves simply another and that gives one the buzz, when you knew the buzz, when the sums stops, who is it?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern state waitress" was asking me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out to the outside, and she says," "" "mom that you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no saying no more than two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not "estimate."</seg>
<seg id="675">It calls no one else "estimate."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my cabal, and here everything is changing my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and show their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and lack of swinging, I cannot do anything except to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quietly.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I was created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they do not exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists is sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, waxing and the song, in which it's going to get rid of, or whatever the girl wants to release in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and a energy balance comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is soft, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the totals, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I'd know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the working-room, the titanium-sumables, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I'm describing through programmes and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums of money depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the electricity that comes from lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of the story, the overestimating tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums of God is the voice in my ear, but perhaps he whispered to God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, a lot more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play is not enough to play as, as you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This approach is painful, because what a man prefer to be as being home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We go around in the garden, in front of and back, and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We fry silk bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take a look after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children tell me how to live and the buzz of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we ever ceased with the Games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! just say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naive, for a daydreamt.</seg>
<seg id="742">You have probably right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they show up they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I will replace a Mariaketle or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And that my teenage daughter speak all 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can take 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes by piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children ready to finish.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are available!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellbeing, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to have the money to have a place for the peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">About "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I stick and I love. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a bit, why not get a total 15 minutes away?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working not without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. she leads me to new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I do not love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the money, the money is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is my snub that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land, which I drive, the marathon, the canvases, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, beying, naked and new life-feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things I bet you to live.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks lovely.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very small ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgical surgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard of one of the most prominent, the "woofers" stimulation. thereby, one implank an electrode deep in the brain, in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffered from severe trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was guiding Oberphysician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often, I gave patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in skull-Hirn-traumata the brain is floating and the skull-pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, one has to lessen the skull resistance.</seg>
<seg id="816">But sometimes you have to remove a part of the inflated brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the inflated brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue to grow is comparable to very small children that are extracted from your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">One has to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts he managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">That looked at it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you still know from Biologian lessons, that stem cells are inmature cells, which can turn into any cell typ of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small neck of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We took a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They got slowly and after a few weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but did otherwise hold.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our large hirnrindermis cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the foetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source, which enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This was what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to find a piece of brain mass from the non-lingual area, and then the cells can cultivate exactly how it was Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently mark them to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we rhymed them at the disposal of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologation transplant - Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we rhymite these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we rhymite the same cells in the sulated brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario rhymed up the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after several weeks she had completely disappeared, as if they were taken back home, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they disappear there.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we put an injury to and rhymed up the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells, which were rhymed.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we colored in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we set monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable weight level, we injured in the motorized cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover by means of sculptural brainisms. they are recuperate to a certain degree, just as the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkey who recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see, when we rhymed the cells rhymed up: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can make them freezing and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for instance with Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal themselves.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can't need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms, in order to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the authorisation of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it's useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable antness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy is dwindling with us in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as Finance Minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that have been implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In that moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rising friends who would be repeated to me that democracy would change if anything would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">In this place I would like to introduce an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, along with me, to believe in believing that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save ourselves democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenceltic democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy our societies become dark, our future bleak and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradoxes."</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his Twin-Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is, however, to be anxious to invest there, where it could contribute to productive and income in which one could contribute to the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, there were invested 3.4 trillion dollars in the U.S., in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, jam, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion dollars will sound like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion dollars that at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the borrow and prescribe the property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">In this way, debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which are not reflected by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 yrs old in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low demand that feared that they don't invest. just like Ödipus father, who is out of fear, the prophecy of the arch could be true that his son would kill him when he grows,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntary the circumstances cause it to lead, that odians kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my case with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely worwiper art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and to finance all of the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the open and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy included naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to minate the significance of the athic democracy due to this degrees." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenical democracy was and is that they were the working arms and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they attuned to them the right to political co-determination with the same voicing in questions of the state of government.</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenian democracy has not kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also quickly burned down.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens.</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was delineated on policy while the economy - the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our present democracies has been occurring since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two instead, by gradually emigrated to politics and deprived them." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like in the past?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about the degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because that one cannot be in the government today and still not in power, because the power from politics to the economy is dised and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hails with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores, which sustainably has the animals, of which it feeds, undermined that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that the politics has so far more cancerated by the self-causing economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devaluated, the inequality rises, the overall economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are to be scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful the capitalism distributes the "demos" [the people] go out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labor power and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" will retain control so as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't really good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and wastage.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working arms create!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing nickel-catchy by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation will be higher the twin, the wastage and social conflicts deeper, just as I think -- coming in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so we have to re-shape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratic in an abnormal surveillance hyperautocracy that makes the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Star Trek," in which machines serve the people and the people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like, how could it look like this "Star Trek" like utopia rather than the "matrix" of similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples soon.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: ask for a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a work place to the next, and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all incomes come from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no exchange of labour between investment and labour, no big gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no upswing twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries].</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies" "", "especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes in the Bretton Woods conference was proposed in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, particularly against the background of a unified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe you is at the same time liberalism, in which they favored privileged people, and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynesially, globally keynesially.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all there is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar diystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we can decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "the reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand, which is called Larry swmers as a" "" "long-term stagnation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "by transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is accurate, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, therefore I am a libertary Marxist, and like Keynes, and so I am also completely unravel.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if one is not wirt, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your lecture mentioned you Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner you said very clearly what you can hold from the West's view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the status of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most is playing, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense if I may say that provocative, China resembles that of the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- don't remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about the democratic development concerned.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now preferable to do what the West has done in the 19th century, it smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance from the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I ahed that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start with the euro area a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely, to adopt us from the complacency, and the persistent denial made that a massive amplifier line is going through the eurozone and continues to be driven by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">"" "" "" "we had the opportunity to be based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is correct to do. unfortunately, the powers within the euro zone, within the European group, continues to be the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain an economic system which is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism into life, one may perhaps be able to delay a while, but when change happens, he happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any mistakes in your time as a Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister who, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he claims, he made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course, I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme in late February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions caused by the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "neither from the Troika of creditors that imposed us this policy," "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: in spite of all this, and despite the aggressive purpose of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the euro area comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, they will be demonic and destroying the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous alone for Europe but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the way of a post-modern 1930s, which appears to me, it will also be unbearable for the future of Europeans, as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thanks a lot that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy did hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leader at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production facility of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an idolish and describes on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technology, tactics." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very tough restructure industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment of over 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and height shows how many shows will get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" "" "Game of Thrones" "", "" "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows, the addictive, where after you saw a season, your brain asks:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left hand side, here at this end, are shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you what is going on at that end of the curve. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not cause to fall on the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to underoffer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts on the mean outing, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon so doing something, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk Roy Price.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to make successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he is holding a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where everyone can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon got something out for free, you have to feel right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers see these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed when watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You detect when to start the show when one pauses, which parts you would be skipped or overlooks.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to choose which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process this and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom for four Republican U.S. senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "alpha House," "", "but it seems that many cannot remember this show because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">There is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- something beyond average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always searching for finding a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give to shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix has a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic decides that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years in statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You can optimize it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The Mindest thing you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is somewhat terrifying because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever be in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, will be decided whether one person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, in spite of the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data sealed are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009 gave Google known that they can be predicted by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way, predicts -- by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly no longer worked,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- on the workplace, in legal situation, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people unthinkable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be circulated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you prefer to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first, you specify this problem in its parts, so you can analyze the items; as a broad set you put together the items to write a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help solve a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to compose the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to sit down again, even if the information is incomplete, to then touch a good condition -- especially when it is a brain's brain.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else they would not have been capable of. but the decision how to put all these parts, put together again and make a show like "House of Cards" which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices, first as they wetted to TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "we say the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball," it is amazing. for decisions with a Ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- just here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will be able to leave it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them by something much creased, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In this way, perhaps the ball becomes wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as being very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks to which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks lovely.</seg>
