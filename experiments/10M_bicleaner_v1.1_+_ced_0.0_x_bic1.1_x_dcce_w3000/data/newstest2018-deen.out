Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards , which change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a pit lane , where now is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small res@@ ser cultiv@@ ating the sti@@ cking reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to spend days .
it anno@@ ys if land maps are not current .
this knows everyone who had to go upright , because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place in a green meadow instead of a byp@@ assing road .
the historic maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - yet very informative .
especially if you compare them with current on @-@ line cards .
it is clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a sp@@ lat@@ ch@@ work which one recognizes as such .
into the great postcard @-@ card , for cities and communities were more detailed cards , so @-@ called ur@@ prints , incorporated .
these were formed according to the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Ver@@ mess@@ aging management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and un@@ jump the first Ver@@ messung Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ er with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ographic record of Bay@@ erns on behalf - naturally for military purposes .
even though the French troops went off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbors , which cra@@ fted the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV made the project progres@@ sing , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional blatt for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the Internet site of the Bay@@ er@@ isches Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of the morning / Today the state capital is most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
Send@@ ner was founded in 21 years after the map , so 1877 , as a Mün@@ chner district inv@@ aded .
today sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ missions focus on 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after 1878 Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of Bav@@ arian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in addition , a smaller @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written number@@ ing consists of the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ gent &quot; from which the tax tax was derived .
small par@@ c@@ els do not occupy longer than farmers today - but small res@@ ser of the plant &quot; land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 place of the October fes@@ to , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete form .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar there is an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional leaf , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , it reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the ascent &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , we once again close people with madness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created in the Au@@ er ventilation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard joined the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought to King Ludwig &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ank@@ hing of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
he also allowed the staff to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first place was first place , later on 500 places was expanded .
sometime , this capacity also did not leave any more - the reason for the construction of the circular prison in hair 1905 .
there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ r@@ ists in Germany .
on the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ es@@ an@@ ium .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth @-@ home with training .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east residential @-@ houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in architectural approach to the origin of the ir@@ ren@@ ame , was destroyed during the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was by 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head place &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the shopping street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought about the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
one big remained to this day - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a tren@@ ch chapel from the Middle Ages were once occupied by the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking for the second S @-@ Bahn conference .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole on the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil rights published travel plans for Mis@@ souri
the National Far@@ mers &apos; promotion has issued a warning for color of coloured people who are traveling to Mis@@ souri due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P travel Advisory for the federal state Mis@@ souri , which will bring special attention until 28 August 2017 , while travelling through the state , bring special attention and express the first caution because a number of frag@@ mented , ru@@ bs @-@ based alleg@@ ations occur in recent times throughout the state and here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes people harder to gain dis@@ crimin@@ alisation , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportion@@ ately on minorities , prompted the group to release the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of the citizen &apos;s rights , the people are happening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ souri ( NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear discomfort in such an incidence we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited cases like rac@@ ist ver@@ ge against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ essee .
he died at the beginning of the year , after having no gasoline anymore during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ souri in custody without a crime .
the Council also points out to a recent report by the Office of the General Assembly of Mis@@ souri in which black drivers in the state will hold 75 per cent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and about their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ souri &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring if it &apos;s Cau@@ tion money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri recorded 100 hate speech in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate speech reporting program of the F@@ BI , which puts the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri Law that would make it more difficult , a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ al Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states to ple@@ dge immigration laws , to betra@@ y people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further margins in view of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries but lately the measure has been used as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
consecr@@ ated project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ sp@@ n @-@ Project is a success project and continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag , Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have created a picture on site .
at the disposal of the family of Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stood first insights into his operations , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows and also many young animals and in five apartments are served in the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
the Black Forest &quot; milk is for him of alternative mark@@ eters for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este only comes to region@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also called BL@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot act on such steep surface profitable .
the green spaces for a lot of work , much must be worked with the motorbike .
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stressed .
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he do not lead a bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the significance of the Wei@@ ler project and is happy about the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers would have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per h@@ ect@@ are .
I hope that the for@@ estation of the surface could be drawn up for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure that we have is , are people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism due to funding
a total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants in 2013 .
the open air surface area is 40 hectares , which must not be affor@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
the total of the total population of 71 500 Euro was promoted by the total population of 71 500 euros , a quarter was carried by the Municip@@ ality of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus the farmers lost 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ de@@ fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and house@@ wives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter We@@ ather@@ proof : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape of Land@@ scape ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of Wei@@ de@@ ten@@ tious .
the goal is the manifestation of the Black Forest .
requirement is the presence of one of the L@@ PR recorded funding schemes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the ten@@ uous area must not be swe@@ pper@@ y ( Hang@@ out about 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by for@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the fisher@@ man &apos;s hamlet Project 2018 , the application of eight participants is running with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build just 16 kilometres of fence .
the open space corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking off the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic session with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N about the proposals of President for dr@@ astic restrictions on legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller attacked not the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have wr@@ acked it if he did it .
but it attacked their significance , and in particular the meaning that you have been attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus , 17 years after completion of the monument , its base was added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a full thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem which you refer to which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he himself form@@ ulate himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contem@@ por@@ aneous resonance of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your poor , your poor , / your afflic@@ ted masses , who are longing for free to breathe , / the el@@ ting waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable trash &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller was not involved in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s US .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural argument : it is in fact a conflict with the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who put themselves to place their words on the base after their death - did very well that they had accomplished a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an un@@ used classical image .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its poem , the female figure is no longer abstract , it has received a voice .
and she gives himself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change this long time from the right wing .
the large scre@@ am rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was anyone inv@@ aded not , but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ on that bring the American flame into the um@@ ented world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going forward .
it is intended to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh found here on something razor .
the significance of the statue is entirely and certainly a question of the point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they saw from the creative , miserable , but hope@@ ful men after long and often terrible journeys on the Dec@@ ks of ships was seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people , seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome , which they must hear .
and of course this is not the perspective , the Miller and Tru@@ mp will ever wish to recognise .
her tor@@ ch shall not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ aves Scottish members of the team from Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle reminded itself of a time when only two car@@ rots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the Un@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland somewhat special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athlete think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the stre@@ amer .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to team place .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
their surrender was amazing , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were sh@@ ot@@ tish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie was quite natural , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth of silver medal , who will compete in their fifth World Championship at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; incredible , &quot; that 16 car@@ rots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s greatest total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which have been reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ dog Mu@@ ir is leading on this road and last year contributed five British and two European vine markets last year .
it is going to participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m running , is another Scot@@ sman looking for a great season , which included the victory in the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Do@@ yle remembered her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain tells us that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immense &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team but in some cases also with the medals and at the Fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special about team captain will be that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and have chosen to make it very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that are part of the team .
it shows only how far we have come .
and they are here as an established athlete , athletes , who want to climb to po@@ diums .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put this home support and profit from it , that we are at the Olympiastadion again .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking critics about Facebook : take you not to a public office if you can not tolerate the hal@@ ting of voters
the father of our country knew something of the poor press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers took him because of everything , from domestic policy to its political principles .
he swe@@ pt in criticism , certainly .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we will be guided like the sheep for the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland at Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ go@@ ers employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people and have vo@@ iced their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ al Union compl@@ ained about it at the beginning of this week .
the cry of the Govern@@ ors allowed the law@@ suit was fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like ho@@ gan@@ ese .
this is a Republi@@ can Governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest priority of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary trend .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with its voters and to debate his hair @-@ loose head following chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of people who come to the Govern@@ ors side - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by co @-@ workers who are paid with public tax dollar - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan Ch@@ ecker defended the acts of Govern@@ ors and argued that the comments of the comments were nothing more than a moderation .
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ las@@ hing people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , a entrepreneur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profound .
the pastor took the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans of Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked about hate speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I heard that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and gave other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them in the commentary box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people are standing on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employee of the Govern@@ ors were referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
there is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that staff have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical words and to burn demonstrators and silence .
but this is precisely what is happening on digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official that is critici@@ zed for it that he imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter fe@@ eds .
one of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County have last the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they held a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Be@@ in ( R ) received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of its use by Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be that hard .
at the time Washington &apos;s time the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ ing s@@ cribes for his guidance .
and at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; y@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , which made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation with Great Britain , over@@ power his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not have them sil@@ enced .
freedom of speech , views of different nature and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for his comfort during the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led next year next year to the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the end @-@ up unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new au@@ ti@@ ring site and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he reaches his fame with this event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he lay down this place .
he is a di@@ ligent suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was in the year after I won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from the past year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came back to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to an action on land .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; says Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well but you also feel that extra pressure .

less lung @-@ b@@ lown through passive exposure
in the past two decades , fewer people have died because of the passive exposure to lung cancer .
at this results , scientists of the university hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after our estimates a year 16@@ 7 lung cancer is attributable to passive tobacco smoke &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said senior manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when compared he moved his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time there are still 400 lung cancer cases of lung cancer due to the pas@@ sports per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
Haus@@ ant@@ ries prove to be very complex
construction works in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and lie so much in time , &quot; said the director of the Bau@@ und Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the property , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is plenty of ic@@ eber@@ gs in the under@@ lies , which was not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which is constantly hin@@ dered by construction works for the rup@@ rup@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p is a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists against red amp@@ ou@@ les and desc@@ end is already huge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was closed and only the buses are eligible for the ride .

poverty and death in Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cooks the dinner , they use no coo@@ ker .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai volcano in the Un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally puts a sweet potato bar - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the res@@ trained bu@@ d is carried out with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ seas@@ oned hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the arm@@ chairs - she has no furniture - where they also produce their daily work , e.g. clothes with dec@@ ep@@ le water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ ch .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband have been assigned to her no fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is custom@@ ary here .
of course , too late can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony which was recorded in 1969 according to a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.@@ 0@@ 26 el@@ dest had to vote in front of the occupation forces before the occupation forces .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up the independence against the Dutch rule , turned fast to the government of Jak@@ arta , which manages control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or jurisdictions .
in 2003 the province was formally divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent section of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so remote as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital city of T@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo stems , and out of cor@@ ru@@ bs boxes that have been converted through r@@ ust in various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , hur@@ ried because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , adore Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans sent a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , handmade tur@@ ban , its dark shirt and its bright rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indones@@ ian province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst pr@@ ero@@ tism and liter@@ acy rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , grass @-@ mountain , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ old in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Free@@ port has declined in value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources worth estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are however a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensures that Indonesia of powerful military preser@@ ves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port has paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ ans calls for greater autonomy , thre@@ aten this golden g@@ ans and become mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess .
according to the activists , more than 500,000 pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military , tor@@ tured and de@@ tained .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal u@@ pland in 1970 @-@ 20 years were investigated according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region , Indones@@ ian police were de@@ tained in more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters in the last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a report of the Archbishop Brisbane taken from the year 2016 , in which reports of atrocities and torture - rape and electro@@ pl@@ ings are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , because every week incidents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researchers for Human Rights Watch .
the bol@@ ts have reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economies of the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ anu@@ ts .

&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who moved to work in the provincial capital city of An@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - its market costs . &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ mar , and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to the inequalities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign .
the former Zimmer@@ mann had 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua , little changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai does not exp@@ ire only two months after the Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children out there and sang Christ@@ mas@@ lie@@ der before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers quartered on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the scar@@ ed children told them they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers grew up at their tone and later came back to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had dr@@ unken , and swal@@ lowed the group with their defen@@ ders , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to hit that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government Commission was placed on fire and the things escal@@ ated next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football field in front of the local police station and the military commander in order to demand justice .
they bore the cerem@@ onial hunting and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle constantly and a bird @-@ sc@@ ant im@@ it@@ ant - of Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstrators started to drag stones at police and military post .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; when the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it was not released in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not approved by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat of danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he told TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .
kay@@ ak still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered together .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ ots was .
&quot; I ran@@ ged to him and searched his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indones@@ ian only a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the chief spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted their station only &quot; back , &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill ourselves , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prot@@ esters were killed and many others have been injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came only at the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he declared sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and v@@ owed to address the historical abnorm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved right away , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security ministers T@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he establishes a extra@@ judicial mechanism for violation of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the pron@@ unciation began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred quite a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he made a withdrawal when he talked with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said he did not set any plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , who accused the UN because of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua had already been killed , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were opposed such claims with leg@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was interviewed during the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am we@@ ary . &quot;
he says he was still alive in fear later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , scar@@ ed to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the village residents and the manager of a building company that refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , died a person and 17 others have been injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unken , when he was caught in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
captured villagers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the villagers came to officers , who re@@ acted upon them by hum@@ ming War@@ n@@ oses .
but natives say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and a k@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness , as the previous one has been delivered here quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the di@@ os@@ ai parliament called to account the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ gated board for Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sensible development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal Me@@ e , mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , which live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by adju@@ sting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to it , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in the last few years , under the pretext of safeguarding national sovereignty . &quot;
some will never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : above all Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to be able to deal with four or five fields of Sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in greater numbers has arrived .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to carry out their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
furthermore , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of inadequate co @-@ ordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they gave them the rare permission to the film .
according to P@@ hel@@ per K@@ ins , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaigns , the limitations of reporting to up@@ lift transparency and development are not realized .
&quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia to an un@@ troubled province of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua , saying , Visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dismis@@ sed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human right @-@ ambassador , Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar who visited their silence and op@@ pressive him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia received another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua will say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai archipelago , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that it is under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military living in poor education and healthcare services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , see her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; you do not need any money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intimi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sc@@ ams had a last symbolic act of the Trot@@ ter : the cor@@ pse of an sacrifice was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with soci@@ alized head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai in his book and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt in just two years by the high @-@ building , which is known to the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el @-@ tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries had not been reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire @-@ alarm and the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a residents who had his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dub@@ ai &apos;s civil guards spoke that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cleared .
the government said she works on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident may have questions about safety of materials used in foreign areas of skyscrapers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the disgu@@ ise , the outdoor cover to decoration or isolation .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for isol@@ ating and disgu@@ ise in the London Gren@@ fell @-@ Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a surge in which approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is consistent with his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single is not only supported on two pay@@ outs , Waf@@ er @-@ thin did not support the necessary two @-@ third majority .
the often very long , but also very much estimated five @-@ set @-@ classics remain the Traditional value .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states vote for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore , was only mis@@ understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the sector .
not only for the vote had already been the proposal before the proposal to hold the Final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : that &apos;s how the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will continue to have the hosts in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs of the promot@@ ers , the requirements are reli@@ eved , etc . , and the players will have to be completed in front of the Davis Cup less official media appointments .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bringing bot@@ t@@ len@@ ed items into the plane , find a survey
a survey carried out under air passengers that accounts for more than 20 percent or unconscious articles on the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , below , including at least 6 per cent , which occurred the plane while they acci@@ dentally deleted blades or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed them , they would have discovered that they may be irrit@@ ated with fl@@ us@@ weapons , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - that was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ter Inc . , was also determined that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
by the respon@@ dents , the donations that they did not know@@ ingly have tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were visi@@ bly subject to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave to inqu@@ iring articles carried by blades by the safety control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they have not visi@@ bly brought bot@@ tled drugs into the plane .
the company said it has interviewed travelers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally smug@@ gling mal@@ ware due to the airport security would have brought and how many things could have been deliberately done .
it &apos;s no surprise that the people , the most important smug@@ gl@@ ers - do not know@@ ingly or un@@ solic@@ ingly - by safety wear ones who were most frequent .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure which liquids they may take them or how much of them .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of liquids in T@@ SA are conf@@ is@@ cated items from the T@@ SA .
for a time , people thought the T@@ SA could look at books as smug@@ gling ware .
fluids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la &apos;s customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; elec@@ tro @-@ jack El@@ on Mus@@ k will be happy to present a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , he has signed up so far that some of the customers have withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the continually triumph@@ ant figures regarding sales extensions and still gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k will betra@@ y another , less gl@@ it@@ ant number : the final cancellations made in the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months Mus@@ k was frequently applied with the more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is beginning .
now Mus@@ k one : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have been withdrawn since 6@@ 3,000 .
critics always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
at a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 euros ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are posted , belts Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
that the cancellation of so far around twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge among the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
the Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 vehicles delivered last year .
by 2018 , it should be - all models brought together - 500,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k currently there are 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who today ordered a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; must be expected at the earliest during the second half of 2018 , if Tes@@ la creates it , his brand @-@ new , never tested in practice without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it comes to major delays , then the un@@ binding reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then , the company cannot prevent any satisfied customers to run away in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ itt , due to the hes@@ it@@ ant of the rules of the Obama @-@ Era , to reduce emissions back
one day after having been compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smoking @-@ causing air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities to respond faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which was raised against his prior position in a federal government .
it is a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tled Oz@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere with local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , long ago was a reliable opponent of severe environmental regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeated over it to block or delay the regulatory industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ction Reg@@ ulators Roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal State Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority than he tried to undertake the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane uni@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that its turn@@ around with o@@ zone standards simply proposed the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards .
&quot; under previous administration , the EPA has often met the deadlines for carrying out and then waited for set up by activ@@ ist@@ groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementing , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained for more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives it to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt at some point will take advantage of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legal enforcement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on solid politics and the best available information are based . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a broader new collection of o@@ zone rules .
a law approved for the last month will delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York @-@ General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric tail@@ ors , led by the coalition of the States who had contracted the EPA in this week , said the Group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our kil@@ os - is an important profit to the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the about 115 million Americans who are directly flowing from the smo@@ g in their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ o@@ zone occurs when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil sp@@ in@@ eries , chemical systems and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the escap@@ es smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and can contribute to thousands of premature death cases every year .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists rejoice over P@@ ru@@ des surprising course change .
&quot; it is dist@@ res@@ sing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of air that we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to oppose environment poll@@ uting and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to the old cemetery @-@ no@@ real in turmoil on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 pm on a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius @-@ site a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth benefit @-@ Seren@@ ade can ench@@ ant itself from this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stressed : &quot; it is a unique rural hamlet . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württemberg &apos;s Ur@@ gent book : Earl Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain by clicking on Mag@@ ister E@@ ber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and to his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the document according to the certificate , standing on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the ein@@ sti@@ cal parish church also a glori@@ fied courtyard , to which the church or the Pat@@ ron@@ age was right and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the village of Tum@@ bes are still visible , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glori@@ fication of the village .
ancient maps from the period around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ age was created from the early Middle Ages .
a Lord , who built a church , har@@ dened and occupied with a priest , remained loyal to this church and was able to bequ@@ e@@ ze this self @-@ church .
this was the right to use a pastor or propos@@ ing the Bishop a new pastor .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two cru@@ mb@@ s at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bells were then first 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the wind@@ ow@@ s@@ acks were inserted and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ close .
17@@ 96 lag@@ ged French troops near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as a fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ aire @-@ cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ers .
18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was broken .
only the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m was allowed to stand .
in the New Year of the New Year in 18@@ 34 a storm ra@@ ged the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and the half stor@@ med .
to prevent an evil , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the Tur@@ m@@ t@@ wer@@ g today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em is the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organis@@ ers invite friends and promot@@ ers of tum@@ ours on Sunday , 16 July , at the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel .
designed by the comb@@ o of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium asi@@ ums Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with word @-@ contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ te@@ is .
Local Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program begins at 16.@@ 30 pm .
admission is starting from 15.@@ 30 pm .
for the long @-@ length of the Seren@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with its wide view over meadows up to forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers offer the fantastic view out .
the Seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to obtain the historical St. Hil@@ arius @-@ plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and hear@@ ers .
the friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours feel especially committed to the home care , such as Seren@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini .
society wants to test permission from Wind@@ wheels
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned towards the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been asked to increase its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen only have existed on the border to swal@@ m@@ tal a wind power zone .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time the concentration zone also causes exclusion of wind use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all kinds of zones should avoid an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city Vier@@ sen had decided a few days earlier by a change of space @-@ use plan , a second wind @-@ con@@ centric zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but who had not approved the District government of Düsseldorf because of a form of form@@ ities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the lack of planning legal conditions , the shared per@@ missible authorization is still un@@ lawful , and therefore also decreasing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ g , President of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council entered again the wind @-@ centric zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette in front of the summer break ; a permission of the District Government is still standing out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines plan@@ ing legally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been made since last week at the district Vier@@ sen , &quot; said a spokes@@ man .
the circle takes them to the occasion to test the matter again .
they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to speak on Thursday with the argum@@ entation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NE@@ W re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , construction of four to 200 meters high wind wheels .
already last year , the company , at which the town is quad@@ ro@@ uted , pop@@ lar agreements concluded with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of great terrain .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand from around 11 400 households is to be covered - that represents around one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ legged households .
the NE@@ W Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there was Vier@@ sen City &apos;s green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ abs together : Ms. dies at an accident
one terrible traffic accident has occurred on Friday afternoon against 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ Wal@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn cable ) .
a woman was wounded there .
two more people were easily violated .
the Landes@@ straße remained more than hours closed .
after police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch came out with their car in the course of the accompanying passenger with her 53 @-@ year mother as a companion to the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and retailers plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to be re@@ discovered in the city center in September .
the romantic trial and the city management want to use the weekend at the end of September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the inhabitants for the shopping bum@@ ble@@ bee .
as Chairman of the profession , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend is intended to raise customers for it , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
there is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the market market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city are to be invited to the &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ rains shop . &quot;
the action takes place not only on inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an Internet video and printed bag containing the Ak@@ tions @-@ weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and ren@@ ditions are cooperating with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce .
with this , the ren@@ ditions go one and the city to another stage of the &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City &quot; project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest together with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brief@@ ing Sunday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the zi@@ cht on Park@@ charges on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential are to be re@@ developed again or again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also have lost the city center when they get out of .
at the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city center - to landlords , the plants of the whole city and one .
it landed in overcoming a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that partly spread out , the king had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with the fact that the first third &quot; home shopping &quot; took part in Germany , for the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and St@@ ago@@ da .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day shall be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote value for the value of local trade and make its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership under the spring leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also make clear that each citizen can influence its direct surroundings with its purchase behavior .

Tru@@ mp passed down by calls @-@ to @-@ sighted trans@@ criptions of telep@@ hon@@ y Mexico under pressure due to paying the border wall
trans@@ cription by phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leader of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tru@@ mp called for Tru@@ mp in a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the U.S. President inv@@ aded him because he denoun@@ ced the wall openly . he said to him , &quot; This cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and schw@@ or , Mexico to pay for the project .
trans@@ cription of his first appeal with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridicul@@ ously , &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; fool@@ ish &quot; and that the existence of the Obama has been given to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p , &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; This is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driven by a group of spectators in rural mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ ink on the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block its way .
the captain of the mo@@ bs - a man of middle age in a needle @-@ strip , took a long train to its ci@@ gar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
indo@@ ors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brood the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams torn down the silence , when a young black man was torn away from the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene has been played , which was played on 22 July , only a post@@ pon@@ ement .
but if a loop is thrown around the neck by &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all in the audience looked very real si@@ gh .
since 2005 citizens have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey , by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organisation of retro@@ fit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a smile on a story but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Congress of Congress of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him , the post@@ ure serves as a dram@@ atic call for action and represents an annual memory of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that wron@@ gs never been corrected .
&quot; we aim for prosecution ; we want to end up , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a qualified physician lays out a beg@@ gar@@ ment of the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files that were received by the N@@ BC news , more than 50 men were de@@ ported from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding Graf@@ sions in the mo@@ ist process .
but nobody ever was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain at the open foot for decades , civil righteous , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the first time in Georgia for the first time to prevent their voice in the pre @-@ struggle in the summer .
about at the same time as the choice , according to details of the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ t Roger Mal@@ com , a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supposedly due to a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed from the prison , and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b cir@@ cl@@ ed the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , &quot; closing it from a F@@ BI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence of evidence of the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks made it even more concise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; when you register and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot;
for almost a decade , C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene presi@@ ded the annual desc@@ endant of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is illustr@@ ative , touching and is grounded in a kind of profound racism , many believe that he does not exist in America anymore .
it is hard to watch , and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are then confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the bl@@ acks - in a room and lu@@ sion@@ ed when Gre@@ ene launched a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ case Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief Executive Officer for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room tested the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the nests , and printed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- , disappeared from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ mus@@ er@@ wi@@ den the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs am lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos;@@ n --- &apos; said &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet , &quot; wit@@ zel@@ te of one of the other black actors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy trying to get this properly , not just because of the game , but also because of memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , if Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with hind@@ foot .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there is fri@@ ght , shots and then silence .
a woman , clo@@ th@@ ed with a funer@@ al dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and guides Billi@@ e Holidays Lob@@ sing@@ ly &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks out every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators is caught per@@ spir@@ ation and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost uni@@ form@@ ly between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down only the road .
they have seen all nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as moisture when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the grav@@ estones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mur@@ ders has stayed a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you place on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de takes place , the air feels great .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and insp@@ ected the cor@@ pse .
children ho@@ cken at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , as if he wanted to remember this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes thanks Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sil@@ l and wi@@ pe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ ised Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the pe@@ el that played the C@@ lan@@ ton .
Nick Ras@@ mus@@ embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sets off with the actors for dinner together .
at a table chat@@ ting a white pair from Atlanta , excited about the post@@ pon@@ ement with a black couple that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words that has left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you themselves and do what they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the mo@@ ist still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the only police shot is called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks keep on his table he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he began to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ ure is inspir@@ ational in a way because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not know his own story , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the three Rhine @-@ wise - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ieren as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderfully .

Stephen M@@ illing sings the majestic fi@@ ber@@ ant Ha@@ gen , which surrounds the au@@ ra of a wei@@ ght@@ fold .
brutal the scene , when he was shot Sieg@@ fried .
later there must also be Gun@@ ther ( Markus Ei@@ che ) .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .
Sav@@ ings are celebrated between Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who complic@@ ates himself modest and hands on Merkel &apos;s smoking .
great applause are available for the festival orchestra which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual wear .
with tension was expected the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his regional team .
in 2013 he had still a ri@@ f@@ ading pillar to go over , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the &quot; bu@@ h &quot; went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the public has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in some way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of that view has grown .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work equally in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I am helping here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I was already working on the school in an open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , therefore a late volunteer volunteer .
how does that come ?
quantity : I have done Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a civil engineering , let &apos;s say successfully interrupted .
I have known for me , that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
take a social year , since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point , perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will launch my studies in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , do probably take place in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social work education and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not uncommon during volunteers to have several different locations ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always happens always to be where one makes his FS@@ J .
you can make it from aging to youth work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social labor .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in after@@ care support .
for me it was the right thing that has mat@@ ured to me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
different from the construction of the civil engineering ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ ati@@ sts .
there are always other people who have a different story behind each other .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been r@@ alled from the family - you must always go on making it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also some negative moments , but so that life is just .
Pear@@ son shor@@ tens another 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut additional 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure with which the company is facing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gra@@ de@@ mining , the Director @-@ General , John Fall@@ on , predominantly in late 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where more than 4,000 jobs were lost .
Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction programme to further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business which was made by quick step to digital learning .
the company , which had expressed his involvement in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House in the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged , after it achieved a growth of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ voy attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in su@@ icide attack
a su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ aker attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier of Nato and several other injured , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been violated , divided a statement by Nato .
confirmed local reports , according to the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , died also three civilians .
the bombing is the last violence perpetr@@ ated by Afghanistan for this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a su@@ icide bom@@ ber had killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of Nato , it is to happen the explosion on Thursday night when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ per army &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state can be treated and treated at the U.S. military hospital at the Air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , there were at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July a su@@ icide car@@ ap@@ point killed at least 30 people in a mainly chic district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on May 31st , a giant bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city had more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 the Taliban ru@@ ined by the power .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since US President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering the number of US troops to increase military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide attacks in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af G@@ han@@ i .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by law@@ suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama Administration , after which the states are obligated to include the smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this took place a day after 15 states def@@ endants the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and they show the commitment of the agency to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and remind us that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA in June that should be measured in a part of the country of pollut@@ ant emissions in which to adhere to inc@@ isions to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to release a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , held on Tuesday law@@ suit and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to drive a wide range of environmental issues which former President Barack Obama has imposed , as a part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp .
however , the efforts have triggered the impact of the Democrats and reserves groups who are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; lung function &quot; and can reinforce the respiratory symptoms . &quot; such as asthma .
vul@@ der@@ ate wants common space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two objects , the council of flu@@ orn comp@@ lies the establishment of a common space in the future retirement homes .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing property is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
although it is still going to take time until now the church community belonging to the church is owned , but there is now no planning of planning for the project by a private investor to st@@ em@@ powering project .
there is a discussion regarding a common area .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the municipality .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with an overall 70 square meters area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the church are so@@ ars to see such a common room just as a meeting place for residents of sen@@ i@@ xed living things , but openly in the community .
as an example , the word made from &quot; Stri@@ pe café &quot; round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be decided that by providing support for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction lies in the refurb@@ ishment area .
the establishment of a common space would be , as reported T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
the proposed proposal is seen to signal the investor to show him in this respect no bil@@ lets between the legs , the conclusion that both the en@@ closures - which lowers the ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the tr@@ ap@@ ron and the construction of economic power - would be possible .
unnecessary , so does not only mean Wil@@ fred sole , be this addi@@ tive .
if &quot; s helps : unanim@@ ously happens to the body .
not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which you can &apos;t move so right now for that you stand now in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ ve absolutely speaks for the communal space - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it does not see behind it a hidden sub@@ stitution in any case of high power or even foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you give no grant , but then get a real , in doubt counter@@ part , is the counter@@ speech .
stadium request , proposed by the proposed proposal , takes three advocates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counterparts in the original program that Stefan H@@ er summ@@ arising so together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we summ@@ arize the decision , we make a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in the first official mandatory register of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense play &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the res@@ z of Stern to Stern
in Har@@ z Germany is supposed to be the first &quot; star path . &quot;
this is planning the Club observatory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ pf@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes towards the information of many Har@@ z@@ ers , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and sporting power .
members want to set up the table along the planned route and inform about stars and star images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good achiev@@ able installations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ vention of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ ater and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be comple@@ mented by the Internet .
that &apos;s why you play a good mobile network for a good mobile network .
accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ ring train should be expanded by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the spect@@ uses a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star grows stronger lumin@@ aire than another , even though it is much further away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will also be given , to which constellation can be found out of selected star and when it is best to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been operating since 2014 in the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observatory in Northern Germany .
the location in the heart of the Har@@ z National Park , according to data protection , is one of the six most dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andromed@@ a galaxy are clearly visible with naked eye .
in the university city since 2003 on the initiative of the carrier , Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen is something similar to the planned star@@ ch - the planet &apos;s planet .
starting in front of the h@@ ull hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet passes along with its st@@ mp@@ s up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observatory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community equ@@ als ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the ri@@ mp@@ s with the individual planets - inclusive of the bo@@ d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ing Plu@@ to at the termin@@ us - are exactly at distance and measure of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink so on a bul@@ let of 6.5 mm diameter , while the sun is at least 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres in height .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light is needed from the sun to the Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pedest@@ rians need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestrian are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ star but would still last half a year .

&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to go down to light @-@ weight .
and he must move on Lei@@ cht@@ wei@@ ler &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .

climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to make a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their athle@@ tic championship battle in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked after him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and expressed themselves openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , he treasures Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous warri@@ or , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trinity Champion from River@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to be co @-@ Aus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

both said , they might feel the Mom@@ entum in his own battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters and this is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Ver@@ last after tire Plat@@ zer
in an accident on the A7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira from 16,@@ 30 am shortly before the connector Market was probably after a tyre bur@@ sting control over his vehicle .
the truck went to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he was over@@ hau@@ led and then lying on the roof in the green ro@@ am .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
during the initial supply of the last through the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic could be subject to the left @-@ down strip to the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that brings the optimization of the defensive formation into Au@@ e points .
with the first end of the season , Andre Hoffmann was content , with the result also , since they were not the two oppos@@ ites at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ers too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tr@@ ap@@ ette is also to be further optimised .
and a gate after a fre@@ ist@@ o@@ ß would also no longer want to catch any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) puts on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experiences in the preparation with the triple , than with four qu@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we can act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach of Fried@@ m Funk@@ y , but Hoffmann is confident of his cause , &quot; because we have just finished in the tri@@ ples on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann player who can build up well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a prerequisite , however , that we would like to harmon@@ ise even better and we are not able to carry so many play@@ mates in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
naturally also , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak after a mis@@ chosen start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance might be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after six to eight seasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fried@@ m Funk@@ y , who did not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken off because of an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ y and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e could possibly be some fresh , as they don &apos;t have he@@ avier and complete game like Fort@@ una would have gone against an ascension out in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhine as a lighter Favor@@ ite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we left them away , just because we claim to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ y , whose record is at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one has to hit from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Che@@ f@@ coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ y will not want to experience its players on Sunday in any case .
new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of those tested were older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( puzzles ) has started conducting tests last year .
they should be more precise during the asylum process after the age of asylum after the Swedish migration authority ( migr@@ ations ) has been critici@@ zed because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were inf@@ erior .
until today , migr@@ ations en@@ ched 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the time from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed , that the person was perhaps 18 years old or older .
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistently stable in the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said The Local News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has been lied over his age .
in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the person examined 18 years or older .
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 published results , she realized that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of the medical imaging assessment , in the X @-@ rays of white @-@ teeth and MR@@ I recordings of g@@ imm@@ ing , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ olin@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people , to see if they entered sooner or later than pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had the reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
if we cannot say it for sure , we should not do it as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency however defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is un@@ correct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy emphasis was placed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ ly , builder on the road @-@ being and traffic in the governing council of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work began simultaneously on all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
construction is planned for October and it is safe that the timing is maintained .
the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ mod@@ elled .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance to the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has on the mid@@ day tomorrow on the north side , a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so called fr@@ aming cap .
this is a random , which is also used as a factory .
at the southern part of the bridge a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge should be used on Friday .
on this then the pedestrian road was going to be gone .
the special thing is that it is a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented fr@@ ing@@ arm .
special finger@@ tips made the set of lines through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass op@@ tic cables connected to which many companies are connected .
the inhabitants were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cr@@ abs had to be cut off .
for the bridges between the Bau@@ hof@@ building and the collection in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for construction work at the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is closed .
the costs of the three bro@@ kers will amount to 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ d in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties move to a rope but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , what else is difficult to put under a hat .
the constitu@@ ent parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows in this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Hall Ron@@ dell to the loud poster &quot; large election campaign &quot; invites .
and known names at the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leaders of the Bundestag for the Bundest@@ ags election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman of Stor@@ ch of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on @-@ site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the African @-@ haw@@ kers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel stays colorful . &quot;
originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain site , but is now taking place on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ro@@ wer event in the Stadthalle .
a colourful image that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , head of the forum One World and one of the authorit@@ ative organizers , really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great as many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ancient potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him with him .
the police has be@@ amed many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it also displays presence in particular at the station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how did the Af@@ ak have actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes tells of the Af@@ ei@@ dal vul@@ ture , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a pre@@ diction , because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us cherry not enough parking spaces available .
so , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking to the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the right right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : against 20 o &apos;clock on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ et@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ president Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners who are waiting for the leaders of the Bundestag for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch will hold their speeches .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ o @-@ event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is appro@@ achable after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can with@@ stand - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a reunion with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ists Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Kloster@@ kirche .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he is a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have won sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European leaders .
thus , Pet@@ kov sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter with the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a soldier of the SW@@ R Symph@@ on@@ ie@@ or@@ chester .
both unite the desire to not only cross the boundaries of their instruments but also to merge the limits of different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach at the two like in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music , &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ S@@ op@@ re@@ istr@@ gers N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mix classics , jazz and the free play to a fascinating work artwork .
this center@@ piece of the program was first listed in Freiburg this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it for both musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with its special acou@@ sti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kr@@ isten Stewart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kr@@ isten Stewart quite openly about their bis@@ exu@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I am once in gri@@ lled cheese , I think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes as next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ ph@@ stars was the one to her &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson &apos;s which eventually deal bitter .
despite all of this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin compared to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously fallen in each one I posted .
or does it believe that , I could have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kr@@ isten gave them that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I have never confused me or hin@@ dered .
I just liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially of these suffered it loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at school time , when she rather dressed as a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a bug .
I felt really attacked , fri@@ ghtened and damaged .
now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public doesn &apos;t like to declare her love life : &quot; people expect you to deal in a certain way and the anno@@ yed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps I call me some to be honest , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you a lot of prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic Governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for re@@ public@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp announced previously a major announcement in the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice provided not the Democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice who according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state has been elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes establishes that he possesses coal mining in five countries , and inherited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night gave a statement on Thursday night , in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would work more than it would work to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , soci@@ able message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e lo@@ aves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world leader of Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday what he described as an open ple@@ dge from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal but he reiter@@ ated it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ umed in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ i said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics World Championship that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping .
he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes , those at competitions gold and silver medals were cut off . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban adopted in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) has found evidence of stat@@ ely sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised itself in itself that it has experienced quite a few times and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been achieved , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athlete from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ ety Russian athletes are started at the athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dru@@ gent@@ ri@@ tests were still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funer@@ al act for in Mali
in a funer@@ al party in North @-@ ess@@ isches Frit@@ z@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two were thought by a helicopter in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
in the un@@ clarified dis@@ agreements , Defence Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two transform@@ ers , but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their expert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we dissoci@@ ate ourselves from this highest sacrifice , which they acted in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen were born on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and was accompanied by a total @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er cathedral Saint Peter .
at mid@@ day they first took only the bere@@ av@@ ed at the church farewell .
then the funer@@ al party started in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
underneath were also Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
grape @-@ branches laid down ro@@ ses , the members of the arm stood by arm to the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense by Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bom@@ bed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rod @-@ cat@@ er@@ mann have been the air @-@ operation of the martial art tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar with up and be one of the first six @-@ trained tiger @-@ pilots of his Regim@@ ent .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the Regim@@ ent , to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , it would not have been ver@@ mo@@ ist . &quot;
doubt about the UN &apos;s mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen not showed that the application is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funer@@ al party , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr did not cause any information .
prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by his wife .
the shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
traditionally , the Danish temple of ro@@ ar is buried in the cathedral Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , it was further in the message .
where prince Hen@@ rik will bury , be unclear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
prince Hen@@ rik never had a secret to make sure he was not happy with his title .
after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ die in 1972 he would like to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he went into retirement and also sets the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prin@@ cipl@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he sees himself not as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene b@@ b@@ by , the Che@@ f@@ speaker at the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ year will be still unclear .
but he is not the intention of being buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for over the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristocr@@ acy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Thames at the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew away , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 years of reg@@ isters at the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , soap st@@ umps instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I ro@@ b instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation to be , the brand social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for for@@ esi@@ ght .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before the possible majority in Lower Saxony
however , precip@@ itation Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green governance for a swift re@@ election of the day , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Gre@@ ens from its Land@@ tag in Lower Saxony was pl@@ ung@@ ed by the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Land@@ tag , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover therefore lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets set up their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( deser@@ ts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future at the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained them on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his group to take them up .
that could have CD@@ U and F@@ DP together 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on country , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new landing tag will be elected regulatory on 14 January .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they are in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l does however , however , considers that the country tag quickly decides its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on how to proceed .
the state of affairs also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s parliament votes the confidence and chooses his successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally controlled and tested &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in silence if they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the Tw@@ enty step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy itself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it was referred to as a pend@@ ant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the dism@@ iss@@ ary MPs to return their country house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she has received their country house , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared met@@ a Jan@@ s@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner shared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presidents of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we de@@ pl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ enormously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have deliberately decided not to lead a debate in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no sub@@ stan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condemned the over@@ head of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ als to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) decision to re @-@ release the country &apos;s day quickly .
the outlet at the expense will cost red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the policy of policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last van@@ ity and in their frustration their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty inter@@ lu@@ de and attempts to strike out of it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
precip@@ itation CD@@ U Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its MEPs to include El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ als to the CD@@ U .
the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , cast the jack@@ ets to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the day @-@ election in 2013 .
the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD strong power , SPD and Green , but in the country &apos;s day , however , a hau@@ ghty majority of one voice .
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed over contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is speaking to the interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protection from toxic eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumer consumers to look at exactly the eggs in your refrigerator and review the stress pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery @-@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ ge .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di is taking the best crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the insurrection of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food Sur@@ veillance is the mission of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and has since become acquainted with Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the information and risk assessment are available to consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trade has the same as the manufacturers to make sure that the sold @-@ selling products are traffic @-@ capable and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able .
if there are eggs of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are non @-@ restricted .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the companies are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the highest level of knowledge the manufacturing companies meets no immediate blame .
rather , they must be expected because of mut@@ in@@ ably illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is too little control in the crop .
is it only lacking in the personnel or the in@@ conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
but it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
but the truth also does matter that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 per cent .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the pro@@ secut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences may be of decisive importance .
I have repeatedly said many times that I expect an incomplete information from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alar@@ mis@@ m at food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and traffic @-@ efficient foods .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide in the food sector is used , consumers and consumers are rightly outra@@ ged .
due to the ge@@ pan , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ produced animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be consistently worked on every level and with high pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect all the competent authorities that the fact that the fact is swift and incomplete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial regulate of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European soccer deposits , become N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G needs to point out at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can make sure that N@@ ey@@ mar sub@@ mits it to N@@ ey@@ mar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team through the rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to get a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to be controlled with legitimate use of revenue , which enable them to reach the Crus@@ ak point inside their on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election at the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken tremendous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ki@@ cked to ruin , if banks or owners returned their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P moved from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the amendment meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested heavily in building up the crew and build a global brand - to a tougher matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , Clubs may take losses in the amount of € 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidency in the un@@ gn@@ ade , its UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in remains to be deter@@ red by excessive expenses .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will re @-@ step up the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , towards The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out @-@ clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year deal , so that the solution for the next five years can be exp@@ ired in the amount of € 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine penalty of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is in search of clubs that could try to list its financial supervision by holding their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could transp@@ ose the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing the standard market rates would exceed , the UEF@@ A would do not have this as legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA &apos;s value was b@@ lown by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2006 could come in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar WM &apos;s amb@@ ass@@ adors will be able to find out and one such man@@ oeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the existing sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to take care of the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.2 million euros .
accounts for the last fiscal year must be published further .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ pping purchases .
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s departure by saying that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership in PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose society is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financing Fair@@ play , because you have different ways or if you have different interests , if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board has made chocolate for Swiss Life .
now the firm &apos;s collaboration with a possible conclusion : the airline is writing the order anew .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ akers in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency SD@@ A , a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; on Friday .
according to current planning , the Air@@ line will open a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
some 17 million small red @-@ white Scho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ els are distributing 14 grams per year the flight companion from landing to the passengers .
Swiss Life does not want to make any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; branch in@@ sider value the order volume in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ wes@@ tern@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros daughter made an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , more important is the advertising effect : for a shock manufacturer , it is a prestigious order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as many applicants on the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in question only Swiss producers come .
according to the newspaper &apos;s report Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018 .
for the SD@@ A the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate boards have been distributed in Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss a contract concluded with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was supplied in collaboration with Hu@@ gs the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo was Swiss a half and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers .
for long @-@ haul flights the customers of the First Class with delicacies prepared by the Con@@ fis@@ erie jumps , in the Business Class n@@ um passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
in the short track Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia is going into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show old die Sk@@ et@@ ch com@@ edy for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before its stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an embodiment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as a franchise , it feels like the time was short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of its absurd lob@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a speaking D@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by turning to the core of the G@@ ags - actors have been vacc@@ inated children , which will grow up - they nevertheless have the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years later , &quot; with his adults , who are now adults playing is less emotional and his par@@ o@@ dy continues to become more emotional , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker &apos;s films of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sm@@ iles the cradle &quot; ) .
a character by an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now Roman@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant pin , involved in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show old ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the ex@@ ams are the best part of the franchise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ os sub@@ li@@ ppen@@ che of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it is the moments random madness , that could make this franchise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years &apos; , whose last scene will show the gang on how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminded of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : at the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ battle @-@ I@@ kon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created Com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , fighting for truth , athe@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main tro@@ duction - a hard @-@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic i@@ sef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be syn@@ ced in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags about watching ( the police spends the time playing chess on TV as Americans might do it with football ) .
and the list of famous speaker - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game of finding out the voice .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved very much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a du@@ bi@@ ous propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it is often like a single one .
in six long episodes it moves there , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; which has been re@@ arranged on a smaller length could provide its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re better , since Gregor and Io@@ ó@@ z@@ sef visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ ouring a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the un@@ trained communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for fo@@ dder .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on the mid@@ day tomorrow , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart were per@@ secuted numerous objects as the pro@@ secutor of the Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 alleg@@ ations were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 and already en@@ umer@@ ated arrest warran@@ t against them .
in addition , the officials made greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , guns and several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there was German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .
the action was part of Italian and Bav@@ arian investigations .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the ma@@ fia will be organised crime criminal , heavy violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mailing .
already since summer 2016 , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office will be established against organised drug trafficking in the South @-@ German region .
between the pro@@ secut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
so the great use on the Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the sight of the investigations , primarily Italian national , related to the Italian ma@@ fia .
an incident took place on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , in which early morning several shots were fired into a restaurant , which might go to the bank account .
mod@@ elled large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report the foreig@@ ner tab has significant shortcomings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
the respon@@ dence for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen way , has made a report of a media report to large gaps in the country @-@ country register .
defects in the recorded data could result in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; to partially gra@@ vi@@ ous mis@@ decisions , &quot; warned that in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the reg@@ isters , there are estimated ten million people with foreign nation@@ alists , including 5.@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU states .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts so far did not have been good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in some cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data entry can significantly slow down the reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it continues to the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on EU citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; those EU citizens must not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such a false accus@@ ation resulted in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel agency &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the federal government has apparently begun to res@@ hip refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they entered from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is out of an internal paper of the Bundes@@ am@@ ts for Migration and refugees ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper there is therefore , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - except for infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper offers a reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , the state can res@@ c@@ ind it to the countries of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the grounds , the ministry now write : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave the request for recording and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) consider these commitments for adequate .
other EU states would also res@@ ign refugees in the framework of the Dublin agreement .
the spi@@ der political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten to thre@@ aten the shortcomings of the Italian asylum system of human rights and a haz@@ ard to the child of human rights . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold the interest rates of 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation led spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain in the midst of interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and for 2018 to 1,@@ 6 % and warned that pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue , whereby the inflation in fall is expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but it sign@@ aled that in the years ahead of interest rates would be necessary to grow from the Bre@@ xit more heated inflation and it said that the credit cost might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members agreed to withdraw a portion of the m@@ wood recovery package that was issued prior to a year after Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for investment plan to provide inexpensive financial resources for banks with the next February that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the bank : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central prognosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the real income of households continued to use the consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interest rates repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain imp@@ unity of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be required than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets predicted the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphasized that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ ast@@ ed growth forecasts for this and next year are projected to be predicted by 1.9 % in May and by 1.7 % in May .
she has maintained its growth forecasts to 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.2 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent disap@@ point growth will have absorbed the rising expectations of a rising increase and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the latest In@@ fl@@ ation@@ Report had little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by a rising inflation and low temperatures , since the ag@@ gra@@ vation is first worse before it gets better .
she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; prevent income from income , &quot; but she added that wages will rise at the end of their three @-@ year forec@@ ast@@ ed . &quot;
the economy is also corro@@ bor@@ ated by rising demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumption expendi@@ tures .
the decision is coming to a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which brought the sin@@ king of the sound @-@ causing .
the Bank is estimated that it will likely take four years until this will be fully achieved .
prior to the last judgement of the Bank on the interest rates , the call for a Zin@@ c increase has increased as the inflation led pressure on hard @-@ op@@ ed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July called a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation has declined in the last month of 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that over@@ taking part in relation to their goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in the s@@ wap bodies , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive , since the credi@@ tor vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ci@@ fer@@ ential to shops and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks especially good for those who run the existing de@@ als and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health service ) is supposed to pres@@ cribe HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transforming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV infection treatment after a fight against the financing of the medicine in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ approved prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) that may reduce the infection risk of around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ al Court issued a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess magazine announced by N@@ HS England Chef Simon Stev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to make the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be launched in whole of England in April 2018 .
presentation prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations to be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP is significantly reduced the HIV transmission to infection groups .
EP before intercourse should take that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are questioned for treatment in question belong gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals appropriate participants will identify that the study agree , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a nurse , can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating dental clinic .
the program will submit £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply medicines this week after an international competitive acquisition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of the EP in which clinical trials are collected , how it is applied and implemented in a large scale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ haul the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
vice @-@ EP when it is targeted towards needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiating with a partner which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ ing has been described , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Schatten health Minister said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after monthly delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation through the government and over@@ due .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is done as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society one step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big life live : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , res@@ umed 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I love me in her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet large apartment was completely obsol@@ ete .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a wel@@ ded layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and one me@@ zz@@ anine to best use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted to high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she asked the architecture and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi made of Notting Hill to make the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an me@@ zz@@ anine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative to solve the reproduction .
&quot; the steel plant is rather complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stran@@ ded by each other without we had to sn@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform but to lay the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or at the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled it Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with lots of extra Drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ anine a classic cop@@ ic window of re@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold @-@ furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illum@@ ination set the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding the theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make him longer work .
the kitchen feels the mirror as a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all the tri@@ angles and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a gar@@ an@@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of Engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so it is when you slide the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basic space - or how your property will be appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate bro@@ ker will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the surface area and at the same time use high quality materials , which offers the space its luxurious benefit .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore help create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love yourself in the electrical socket in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can turn out through good design and increased square footage of some standard into something quite ast@@ ounding .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in an analysis due to one of the largest property of the Vict@@ ori@@ as , worth over 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he led him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw himself from the family run since 2014 , but a sharp argument about the separation takes place at the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers met 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
she founded West@@ co Je@@ an and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis covers offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her died father , Col@@ in - was described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s power and Paul about one third .
a judicial system stating that Col@@ in Property has the value of 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul valued at 17@@ 6 million dollars .
for Paul , the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those proposed by Col@@ in proposed ratings have left him with what I kept for the best items , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday he took place after several failed agents , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - from which col@@ in , how Paul claimed to be excluded .
col@@ in argued that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul before to manage some possessions .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to teach the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were the Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ acy shops from the late 1950 @-@ er and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , in which col@@ in the first je@@ ans opened the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , they hoped their property to pass on to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to end the brothers in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid 10 million dollars in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very backward , although he was a former AF@@ L pre @-@ board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad , very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to acc@@ ent me and to draw our family name by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have knew that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new staff leader is planning to restrict the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly could actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tru@@ mp - including reports of the news media - in the hope to hold the boss on a more equal course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new staff leader of the White House , took place at his first working day with man@@ ag@@ erial staff , he presents a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House which he wants to repair : poor information that came into the hands of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ing - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media freedom .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV still is still strong .
&quot; if Candi@@ date was anno@@ yed because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to hold Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election officials therein , to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise price . &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter @-@ habit has ever been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is ridiculous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these fight officials know something we do not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets could not contain even more ig@@ ni@@ ties without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that the Tru@@ mp has not sent .
if his employees had made it several times to keep away from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has consistently prevented it , that Tru@@ mp Contro@@ ls out .
part of the problem is that people together in a white house that puts out of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors to lead the president for strategic reasons beyond doubt .
this was an example , described by porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp like a Vol@@ cano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks and that he will find out how these stem from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened in late February when someone had mali@@ cious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ alist Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy rod of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was ban@@ ished because of ra@@ kan@@ en permanently from Twitter or that he did not provide any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them from the past .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then staff leader Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ amp@@ ed criminals get post by Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the assistance of the people will pray and hoped for .
the police are sent across Europe this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of the sought heav@@ iness naturally not known , notes from the population are hoped and praying .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday by the action , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Adv@@ oc@@ ation of the Winter .
the experiences have shown that many volati@@ le of holiday destinations are hidden , it meant by Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online applications sought so far could be arrested , at least eleven thereof due to references after the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aires &apos; series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on the war , which have negotiated by the municipality of drawn dit@@ ch to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travelers have parked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosperous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aires &quot; series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after they were ki@@ cked out only in May , without being scr@@ ap@@ ed by one from the Council of excav@@ ated dit@@ ch to prevent their failures .
the tactical group found a gap in the defense lines and expressed their cars through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; devast@@ ated residents have afflic@@ ted the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous residents said , &quot; They are at the Mont@@ ag@@ evening where they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones at the pas@@ sers .
the Council must be forced into action by shame , since he was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are back again .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the advice of Birmingham knows how to handle it by keeping long sub@@ missions to protect their parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common@@ place , if the Council cannot stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a inhabitants who did not want to be called , said , &quot; It is ridiculous that we just saw the last round of this trav@@ eller just to lo@@ oted from another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers at this time increases and one has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can proceed as soon as possible .
to support our motives , it is very important that as many residents call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we come to our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof it will be the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on March 1st next year .
these are good news for the city .
after the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof through the then ambience operating company mbH and 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenues from the city tax .
in fall 2014 , in the face of dramatically rising numbers of refugees who arrived in the county , the hotel building of the Land@@ mark Office , as collective accommodation , was offered for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the presence of an development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was at that time in the community at that time un@@ disputed .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois @-@ Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of more serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group of Lu@@ isen@@ hof with business@@ man Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in bad mountain@@ eering , and one in Bad Men &apos;s .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof already stand for long time construction containers in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works will be carried out .
the so@@ ils have been ej@@ ected , blankets to the part built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms are removed .
the entire building building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to be done .
&quot; it is actually a lovely hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the black style .
the rooms are equipped with large be@@ ck@@ able showers , the entrance area is converted , there are new windows built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer can be expressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one wants to position itself not at the high level of the hotel in foli@@ age @-@ bath , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms seems to set itself wide , explains Sch@@ eler .
both individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are co@@ verings with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment was asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
also the outdoor facilities are brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard a large terrace comes from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ affair : us @-@ Special Rap@@ porteur on the Grand Jury
in the Russia affair for US President Donald Tru@@ mp , he is said to have appointed Robert Mu@@ eller after a report called Grand Jury .
the committee recorded the work in the last few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to familiar persons .
the newspaper reported the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded his investigation and intensified .
the sender of CN@@ N reported it already the first for@@ ti@@ ation of the Gre@@ mi@@ ties associated with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
US intelligence agencies accused the Krem@@ lin since prolonged , specifically in the presidential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s electoral campaign and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are aimed at acting in an election campaign as advisor of the re@@ public@@ ers .
according to that , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s priv@@ ates and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special Tru@@ mp Tru@@ mp has moved personally into the center and under@@ mine the accus@@ ation if the president has ham@@ per@@ ed the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand j@@ uries is to examine and decide the evidence in possible breakdown and decide whether charge is required .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called dock .
mostly they are turned on when it deals with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always closed behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the Pro@@ secutor to invite people to dis@@ integrate under E@@ id .
according to the Sender CN@@ N , preliminary entries have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a statement called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. there were also Tru@@ mp@@ s advis@@ er and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ an election manager Paul Man@@ afort .
right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts said on Thursday night in US television that show that Mu@@ eller will not let him sh@@ ook in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
however , the sub@@ stitution of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in research and a new reason to concern President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue give the democrats a way to feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he knew nothing about the introduction of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in secret , he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ated any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent to &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey said three times that he will not be determined against the president .
one has no reason to suppose that something changed in it , it meant that it was in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller was first deployed after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ro@@ oting , the accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were loud , he im@@ pe@@ de the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee made of Tru@@ mp , Tru@@ mp has asked him for an adjustment of investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure because of the examination .
on the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special prot@@ esters and its employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rede@@ emed spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release Mu@@ eller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unlike an independent special feature of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , about the President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller created a position in which he could theoretically be f@@ aded on D@@ ur@@ gen of the President of Justice Department .
several &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bow to such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators stood on Thursday to be dischar@@ ged on Thursday , after which the wai@@ ver could no longer be released so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in the Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg was solved by the scar@@ ce size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
the shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for polar and marine research on Wednesday .
the over one tri@@ l@@ lion &apos;s tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large pist@@ on driving now to the north and will probably take two , three years until it is mel@@ ted .
it has been registered with 175 kilometres length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ic@@ eberg that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger for man is not going out of him .
how much climate change has played a role in the collapse of the ic@@ eberg , according to research information is unclear .
however , there has been a series of unusual collapse in the region for around 30 years , and the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) writes in an equivalent ground .
according to many researchers this could be connected with the heating of heating .
the un@@ broken collagen was so far from the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow even further into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this deck @-@ circle was the balance of wa@@ xing and vom@@ iting a few years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is was cru@@ mb@@ led there , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the edge channel has never withdrawn as far as presently .
in addition , the ov@@ ar stands under tension and can dis@@ integrate , if at a key@@ point a piece of dro@@ p@@ down .
the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , because they swim in the water and bo@@ ils the ice as much water as it shu@@ ts after the mel@@ ting itself .
however , the loss of the ver@@ tex leads to that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
that could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the low degree , the British research project at the observation of the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to AW@@ I information with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth most popul@@ ate is the Antar@@ ctic .
at the passage from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the edge towards the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and is not aware of a direct connection to climate change , the Eis@@ schild is now in a dangerous place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most convenient retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists dispute that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will now grow again or in the long run , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researchers did not go back to climate change the demo@@ lition of this giant ic@@ eberg , in recent decades , many ice @-@ imp@@ el@@ ves of the Antar@@ ctic @-@ Antar@@ ctic are torn down in the past few decades .
this long ch@@ ap of the Antar@@ c@@ tica is spreading in the direction of South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the decline has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been around three degrees in the past 50 years and t@@ amed with it in the areas where the temperature is at the fastest .
CD@@ U wants bon@@ net with staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free spots , the CD@@ U calls to step out of the employer @-@ association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the Krem@@ lin gave 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the Kreis@@ administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees have yet left their first working day .
the cur@@ riculum of the circle are obviously very popular .
approximately 6@@ 20 applicants were available for the places this year .
nevertheless , the circle will continue to be able to deal with the increasing requirements and tasks .
currently , there are currently 50 vac@@ ant positions in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers and the forces of general administration are being sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative in the Krem@@ lin with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and will oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
the management should work out a concept for recruitment and recruitment , according to the desire of the parties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demands on specialists , but future @-@ oriented of the application scar@@ city means it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall concept should be oriented inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an educational background , asking CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this already sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has it to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is given by a ver@@ itable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contest of the public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ related services resulting from the service .
so the highest time to act so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ ters , Leader of the CD@@ U , continues with his party beyond the common request .
he was already making a revol@@ t for a lazy surprise when he was publicly challenged the human resources and the remaining parties were astonished .
peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed to have an exit from the municipal employer association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not coming to a satisfactory solution here , the Kreis@@ administration with trade unions - perhaps too close co @-@ operation with the members of the county , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials , when it actually sees the collective service for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , elev@@ ations or more money there is only when you change to a higher level that is oriented to career years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up in which employees are concerned with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes .
last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , Thomas Hend@@ ri@@ ers and Kreis@@ dire@@ ktor Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy ti@@ ghtened up the tone for NGO migrants
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue , if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German b@@ ail@@ organisation &apos; youth ret@@ ches &apos; conf@@ is@@ cated because their crew worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which is in operation only for one year , refused to express themselves into detailed Vor@@ es of the Italian Public Pro@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our top priority for us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate within the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all alleg@@ ations that are currently raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had over@@ head the boat of &apos; youth Ret@@ es &apos; that supervis@@ es I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is assumed that its occupation ri@@ gh@@ y migrants are on board , which can be delivered directly by men &apos;s hands , and that smug@@ gl@@ ers can cycle , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place just 1,3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Pro@@ secutor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is de@@ pu@@ zz@@ ling about the authority of the Italian coast @-@ guard , which supervis@@ es rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motiv@@ ations .
under the code of conduct , boats and the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not get any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ out actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ iti meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after li@@ f@@ ebo@@ arding measures , has declined in recent weeks , leading efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and co @-@ operation with the local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ ad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine past@@ ors Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz , to enjoy four days long Tri@@ als and attractions .
there were three be@@ held guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est by Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ capit@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there are view@@ points , some on towers , one could see far beyond the Pf@@ alz forest and the prevalent planes .
in between there was always a longer period of ant@@ ages , for the long tri@@ f@@ ences .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , to the Sal@@ ine and the popular saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again view point at the view point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wi@@ gs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days many altitude metres were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ stit@@ ches brought welcome packages .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ me@@ tered the bi@@ kers in the fre@@ ek @-@ inhal@@ ing Sole .
also new city has been joined .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres , the group had seen the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best site - sporty and cultural - met .
console instead of tur@@ f - Bundesliga are ge@@ aring for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in the future sit down in the future computer consoles instead of fighting with wind and weather over the stadium ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high G@@ ages inclusive .
this also recognised the first federal ga@@ dier form that are increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning made 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a E @-@ Sport section in the middle of July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to get completely new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board of Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that on this turn , he will rise several clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next weekend , the soccer world association was organized in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ oom looks great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football must deal in particular with the 14 to 30 years old that young people also go into the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract you could be far more often present on these markets than once a year to send the federal lig@@ am@@ ity to Asia .
what is all about that ?
in the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football @-@ simulation FIFA on competition level .
long ago , as in the normal sport also , Li@@ gen is established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in Asia @-@ 2006 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all a real sport ?
for many , the concept is certainly unusual .
even In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bery has long been dealing with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because he is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions that you can find also in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress levels , hormonal changes .
in addition , there are cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train on the console , but also train their body and respect your diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bery also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are hard @-@ managed in online play , and in the scene they l@@ acked the structures of the classic sports .
positive results highlights the scientists the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the way international , this is like a great global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly concerning advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
sales in three years is expected to increase sales at 130 million .
against the barely 2,@@ 4 billion euros in the Bundesliga .
however , the e @-@ sport is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez , participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ provider Uni@@ cr@@ n .
also in Europe does a lot .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport had been introduced as a class , F@@ rob@@ bery says .
in the Netherlands and in France the soccer league of first @-@ owned associations are meanwhile obligated to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison devoted to Germany , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ board Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only to fall in nostal@@ gia and clearing the old times is no longer sufficient .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time in the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ oom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can not stick to it that only when football remains all the way it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the texts , the Conrad Roy did push for su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend to su@@ icide and calls him su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind G@@ it@@ ters and five years were exposed to local currency .
Carter was sentenced in June for the vi@@ cious killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is unexpected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
she had been faced with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered on a mental illness .
dressed in red pants and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ oriented eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; your actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; said the pro@@ secutor of the court .
&quot; she ended his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has no responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ er &apos;s lawyer said it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is totally regre@@ t@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or tyre wheel or even their cl@@ ergy are a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day in which I mour@@ n the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I am going with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity , to be there for his sisters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they were per@@ secuted by the realization &quot; that they will never be taking part in the wedding of her brother , or be a aunt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this single person with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep on me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit another , su@@ icide , and commit su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy did not have found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxid@@ ation in one vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ter &apos;s text reports revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hands on , Spring of a building , you know yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the moments before his su@@ icide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to turn the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought to attention by the death of Roy , and orda@@ ined that it should benefit by any press from the event .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few , the Carter def@@ endants , Amanda Kno@@ x , was condemned in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before it was acqu@@ itted of two years ago .
MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as captain , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern makes up a big season at the Con@@ fed Cup winner for a great season - Extra motivation is not .
anything else was different on his place in the cabin , which I saw Joshua Kim@@ ono immediately , even if the additional gar@@ ment was very , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to see , he made himself par@@ able Bin@@ de content to his arm .
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria captain .
good , the entry could have been better than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the signs of the coach could also suggest that .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the youth @-@ playground , deb@@ ant , and especially from the holiday of professionals , existing C @-@ El@@ f , chosen as a gam@@ ers , but he .
sugar@@ s are distributed yes to the most ende@@ aring to those you want to stick with humor .
whoever has been chosen to compete the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ ono confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want to play as a player : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
to the right rear , this is now its position , the white bin@@ ders at the arm did its rest .
and at all , k@@ im@@ me had been on this run@@ way as the one who can take the hel@@ m into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vid@@ al to over@@ play its missing fitness ( op@@ ed hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches with it , to get out on the devil , to get out to the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to neg@@ atively impact their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
all of this is quite good .
Sü@@ le ran besides Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the ri@@ f@@ le , both agile sovereign .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often heavy , in addition , Southern also tried to succeed in playing a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave us that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed up a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; playing shift , temp@@ o change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria @-@ World is still available for the re@@ appro@@ vals , one looked after the game .
Ru@@ dy for example was in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but intended six or seven interviews .
to Kim@@ ono , after a few cr@@ acked statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of South , an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what goes here I already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with Bavaria you just need to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he must no longer teach the New Testament anymore .

companies satisfied with rh@@ einf@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz region : economy lo@@ aves Wis@@ sings pace
the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still economic ministries in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is after more than a year , in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T @-@ inquiry by a change in economic policy - and at the same time bl@@ ending the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing acc@@ esses the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us &apos;s biggest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the mosquito control of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Adenauer au stands in the country list of the country at the top .
again this year the ministry hopes for a planning process to 2021 the building is to be right .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ung Tri@@ er , which stands in the urgent need for the suspension .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Council for Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees in it a sign for regional , but internationally competing company .

the Chamber of Commerce Tri@@ er sees in the new Master @-@ Bonus an additional incentive for young apprentic@@ es , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
being planned is a premium of 1000 euros for the class check and 2500 Euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training .

CD@@ U S &amp; D vice @-@ group Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Ac@@ counting , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros in the preservation of the country roads as proposed .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .

Audi is expected to change 85@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face up with a bac@@ kl@@ ash .
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that would offer it to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and is related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limiting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as recall .
European autom@@ akers have greatly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance rules for carbon emissions .
but the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered as car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , plants for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles has to install , also take on what it makes difficult to make the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation equipment , emissions to adhere to the rules if a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions .
several attacks by Volkswagen in the United States were charged , others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former manager of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in Germany was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and may be put to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation by Volkswagen , following the authorities of Audi acc@@ using a system to circum@@ vent the emission regulations in Europe and a request that was focused on the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be heavily stra@@ ining : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luxury automobile manufacturers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transfers to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

also with 85 the Argent@@ inian is still working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ er@@ mo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he struck himself among others as a pointer for fortune - which made him frustrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60s made the breakthrough : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of his carto@@ ons in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris match &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then also in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
and again the artists of cities inspired .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the sh@@ utter tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he is still sitting on the drawing sides today , works almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches will continue to find a lot of spread throughout the world .
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any popular animal in his drawings - that has a genius . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time his figures in the 3D movie which will be able to come to the Kin@@ ol@@ screen .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
therefore he rather sets on the TV series , which is produced as its original desig@@ nations , wor@@ t@@ less .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by Provence from climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the insects thinking about dro@@ ught conditions and because of diseases exc@@ itation insects that causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions to find great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ m , Expert of the Institute Institute &apos;s CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effective , because the plant was exposed to the impacts of climate change in the last few years , who brought a lot less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has an effect on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ornam@@ entation , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that carries the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil lo@@ ys not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ m said : &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , a better water @-@ distribution and slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the beast of the plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry .
the small town of Ge@@ isa in the th@@ ing@@ ling ra@@ he@@ n celebrates his 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the festival point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medi@@ a@@ eval .
cro@@ ws , cro@@ pping , traders , vag@@ ant or a land @-@ camp will be to be experienced in the city center on these days .
the murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met each other , in order to review their plans for the coverage of the recent chaos in the State Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about certainty .
it has been told to them that it &apos;s important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists will discuss what to feel safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades or at home .
security experts have written three words to a black@@ board on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and p@@ aces .
there are drugs , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are ab@@ sent@@ ing on the en@@ closure of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no escape from violence , and during all the land the cor@@ p@@ ses , more and more journalists are at stake : at least 25 years since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 has brought up his office . 5@@ 89 stood by attacks and threats to Bundes@@ schutz und till now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
under the latter you find editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence associated with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its absence will be deeply sad@@ dened , although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; depends on the facade of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their nightmare , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 was established a Son@@ der &apos;s office to edit the cases of journalists , this has started under the committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of kill@@ ings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put on trial .
on Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are un@@ tr@@ acked and even though the terrain is now in stock .
without information on the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very silly to squ@@ ander my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know the Why we mis@@ trust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez abandoned the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to sail a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot;
the cap ran away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez has been 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to wander freely around in Cu@@ x@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
there is nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of kept , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ans for drug P@@ ills , which are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs called drugs in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez has been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt sh@@ attered that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February the publication of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected bor@@ members bought each copy of the issue once they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was in it , Val@@ dez did not comp@@ el to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , leaving the country into its own security .
Val@@ dez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived his friends and colleagues that he would always be there .
he worked as experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he had gathered together with five colleagues for the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without bother@@ ing to the ru@@ d@@ ote problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment the paper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting , and the sales and advertising took place .
re@@ porters loved it to be tough apt to post cens@@ or@@ ship without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were intrigu@@ ed by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors &quot; Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for its coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever it lead .
he gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take on the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce @-@ Team miss Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was cur@@ able like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher , who knew how to survive .
you trusted on his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and always sit there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for the routine his destruction ?
his death also has forced her to ask her own assumptions on how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their cann@@ y run@@ way and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust their own instinc@@ ts .
when it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be decei@@ ved ... and then the thing happened by Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are not in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative smug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees met of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days earlier has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for the monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico .
they sought two polic@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ x@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ porter , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , who referred to the governor itself as not trustworthy .
it has been months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountainous terrain , where the drug gangs are under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has led to three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous box@@ ers Julio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , which focused on the hometown of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that was located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ x@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who kidn@@ apped or how it happened so it was advisable to write when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities .
a re@@ porter from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) belongs to nearly all political planes .
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of highly @-@ consuming cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porters to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man was ent@@ ailed a military attack .
only a few months before the reader had seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez than the most informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been devoted to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
Re@@ por@@ in R@@ ami@@ rez Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped out a few characters and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the Pro@@ secutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials said , based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all over the country journalists have become sound@@ ly stronger by writing in organised protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on pav@@ ements and constructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to pick up journalists and get rid of them because they said the truth .
she has since been asked to be divided by the government because it is concerned that their anger has hurt their objectiv@@ ity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , by participating government officials and an equivalent society . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug users , but also on orders of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks by journalists of police officers and officials in the past year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico die , because they want you take the mouth round , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border @-@ state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ etas de Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer @-@ course and ear@@ phones lies next to their separated head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border @-@ state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do just like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez was publicly directed to the drug @-@ art@@ elle with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they hun@@ ted , as it was apparently murdered by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay backward and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be Po@@ ets , gives , that the drug trafficking are terri@@ fied .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that is why I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , as at once all their phones began to sum@@ mon@@ ed .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ enri@@ v@@ alen and security guards near the bath@@ house Maz@@ at@@ lan had 19 confirmed t@@ ote left .
the war continues to escal@@ ate , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the boarding gate , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the cover page has to be changed next day .
Sir@@ ene he@@ ats close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a view of the polic@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid of all , they showed it not .
under the tremendous portrait of the Fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce pursued his traces .
&quot; how you can only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; If on the same day , where Javier was murdered , the practic@@ ant asked me to send them to the road . &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to do@@ dge his enemies .
at first sight it looks like a statue , even though a terri@@ fying .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian mine worker were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his fle@@ dged skin from red@@ dish @-@ brown was - and they said she would have had something from a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Biology , &quot; described it as &quot; the animated dinosau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved state has researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ fres@@ ser is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he found on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , den .
he met something which seemed from the surrounding rocks at the plane , and decided to see more accurately .
the fossil was discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
you spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) serious pe@@ ens .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you &apos;re just a little with your eyes flas@@ hes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best surviving dinosau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with armor and is similar to a changing tank , probably by meat @-@ eating dinosau@@ rs .
the strongly @-@ ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a par@@ agli@@ ding that is used as a counter@@ part , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to do@@ dge its enemies , saying experts , which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was made for the first time head@@ lines in May and is now visible at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the Museum techni@@ cian Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and armor about his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ cl@@ adding , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means the peak of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the cl@@ adding is common the results are surprising , because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today .
it points out that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by enough pressure by meat @-@ filled dinosau@@ rs , that the evolution of the confrontation with the confrontation was fav@@ ored as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that employ the counter @-@ cl@@ adding - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or bells - are much smaller and more vulnerable as boot@@ y , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong predat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , highly @-@ ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs must have been the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ r was mar@@ oon .
scientists continue to examine the animal in references about his life , including his con@@ serving Dar@@ min@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs when he died , driven into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom .
at that time Alberta was as warm as the South @-@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans once more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preserv@@ ative skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and the original form of the beast , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early cra@@ yon time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only do a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is on sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time , as a huge Ther@@ ser@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , who were standing on two legs , the earth passed .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , lived for millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ oma rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was buried after death in the sea and in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he found on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , den .
according to the museum it is the animated dinosau@@ rs in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to the hips .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops , which were ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ vor@@ es was curved by the Western Canada , until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater artwork of the dinosau@@ r kept his armor in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ ump@@ y armor plate along the dinosau@@ rs .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a win in Lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .
hidden remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y armor plate , which carry the sk@@ ull of the beast .
his right front @-@ foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;

currently there is a test run on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in many other remote routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway re@@ valuation with no creativity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to make use of this , however , some conditions must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already has the most passengers .
you have to also have bought it via the app of rail , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket bu@@ cket .
and last you need a seat @-@ up reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works as follows : one climb@@ s to the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test@@ es you will find a button on the electronic de@@ valuation .
the Zug@@ companion get on their mobile devices a message that Bic@@ y@@ ast X is located in the train and taken the booked seating area Y .
comes the train companion when driving card check in place Y he knows that a passenger is sitting there with a more valuable online ticket .
you can thus continue to sleep , keep on to keep on .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to be relaxed without a ticket check by our migr@@ atory personnel , check out the DB Navigator software yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing Management Board of DB Fern@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our staff have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel , knows that apart from delays and cur@@ ses the ticket controls are among the greatest medical events .
because often one does not have any documents in any case , but one of the travellers needs not all the documents that you need to de@@ valuation online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document that you have to indicate .
the result is endless discussions between tractor and driver , which leads to poor spirits in the part or great room and delays in controlling your own tickets and the creator will at the end time takes time to worry about other matters .
yet only a small number of test@@ es can use the new service .
and that is only on the connections of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further traction numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to their core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis , on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b @-@ apartment , which rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it still lies on the street &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was called there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as nobody else had posted on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was continually deployed to their tim@@ eline re@@ we@@ ave .
the R@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was involved , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live .
he po@@ unding a picture of Brow@@ ns a naked body that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell at himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone in order to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people , the crying , and of a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live fe@@ eds in which a poli@@ cem@@ an has stood before a group of demonstrators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , un@@ insured another poli@@ cem@@ an is his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not custom@@ ary , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can call it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt bulk .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a flight and went home next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched their 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and the protest , of love and loss , of strength and loss of resistance , which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell took with her daughter , which wor@@ e a flower dress and a matching crown , the two went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , followed the two times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember as I have taught you when black people have to fight for that which they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminded what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you need to know it and see it and be raised in it .
it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is free to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck , to give her an experience where she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , it is no other than the next black women child .
I feel , I would give her a bad service to keep them away from away . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that was turned into a camp as the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ trial by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner , who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on demonstrators .
slowly started to accept a new type of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after the 9th of August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black churches .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted merely to document , &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to the point : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by white men - in a community dedicated to their pain and their w@@ att@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt .
his involvement brought the project closer together with six other natives , followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; over the years to Brow@@ ns promise .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are presented , as I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it is in motion &quot; not to have a &quot; Messiah &quot; leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most revealed participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show signs of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ er &apos;s life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; he said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability during this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ er &apos;s story repeated the role of black gay women in the wider black @-@ lives mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement that after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and hence we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must wear the last load of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is kept up by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is assumed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is no affir@@ mati@@ cally type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was chosen as the heart of the film in the he@@ rell because of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who came up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , although it was on the front line because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras had gone by F@@ erg@@ us@@ on since then , but the rac@@ ical connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is at stake for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area they call her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
however , she cl@@ ed to a voc@@ als and she feels bound to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the road three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to discuss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers to discuss bit @-@ gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the Sü@@ ver of the pedestrian prec@@ inct since the first presentation of 2009 split the population into prop@@ onents and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any .
on our Facebook page &quot; People fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the issue is discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a human &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ zen ) or simply simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while prop@@ onents build on it that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , from which also the rest of the shops are benef@@ iting , the opponent fear that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct .
added : the gallery will be designed exactly on the property , where the farm market hall is , in which 13 direct mark@@ ers offer their products .
with the start of construction work will be the end .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in new construction - and to the Bed@@ a square with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying a weekly market hall for many years now .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the grapes are always happy to come back .
also the but@@ cher we discovered for us .
we would wish , even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ eters in a market hall in the gallery will settle at the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the new project might not be too low during the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , d@@ ots or supermarkets : I find it unnecessary .
there are already enough of that in our city .
one sees yet , how many Lad@@ in shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least retain the Mark@@ thalle .
after all , the product offered is fresh , is largely offered directly from the producer and is completely inexpensive .
as one sees , shop transactions are located in a shopping block only from larger companies , because the local tenants are often not portable for a retailer .
pity , special shops there is almost no more and what is left of it , then will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall will not fit me together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farm market hall during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually occurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does it manage to remove all the shops out of Bit@@ burg in advance ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and a shopping center , which is empty , also needs no one .
in my view , it would have been better to foster a real farmer market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , you give it thanks to the ins@@ ane , many - as I find - point@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farming hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ noticeable similar - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ lift and hair @-@ sections created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts taken out of the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st took a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , having publicly made diplomatic reports on Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks &apos;s website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Be@@ come resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and rep@@ ell@@ ent dis@@ appearances , whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has extracted the algorithms of DNA which could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and was created out of 30 portraits , such as someone with these genom@@ ic data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ess determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations , but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , was openly spoken since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the sp@@ y law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her image was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a bas@@ kets , black @-@ white sel@@ ector , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly sitting on a driver seat and a burst blonde with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg had just returned from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; stranger &apos; .
in this , the artist &apos;s portraits of strangers made of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette smo@@ ker and chew@@ ing g@@ um by extraction the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted a DNA portrait .
the artist and their de@@ tained M@@ use were inter@@ changeable for the same letters , which in the course of two years were inter@@ changeable .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic Images , &quot; which fores@@ ee a future which would dict@@ ate the President Chel@@ o judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years was asked in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happ@@ enings .
there is also something deep in opening the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp performs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et ways that he should actually fix , continue to infl@@ ame .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she told that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a written artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature including ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation gender , race , sexuality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and GS and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ cl@@ o@@ tide to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring with it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is stored in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned com@@ ic no@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it comes up with a Fre@@ is@@ pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in the hands of the discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ctic of the United States , like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they put your speech , then they have won &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greet me from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get lost , if I am talking about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room of the masks , from their own genom@@ ic simul@@ ators , which coinci@@ des with hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
it was also focused , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic drivers have been written with pen@@ cils .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said of the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped to Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford because of the kill@@ ings
a national human hunt has been underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were being sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injury .
on Monday were exhibited for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several pins died .
a collaborative warning system adopted by the police authority in Chicago , states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , came at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained at the place of events for dead , and Det@@ ective explore the bul@@ ls as a murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice Chairman of the University of University , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them can now be challenged in assessed and excluded from the operator of the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair , which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an E @-@ Mail declaration that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain in contact and ready to help the US investigation authorities in any conceivable manner . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want he to stand .
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he calls on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has a vision of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from building managers of Grand @-@ Plaza building who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 was something happened .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works at the time @-@ axis and the background of the sacrifice , and explores a variety of motiv@@ ations , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ Chancellor Mut@@ ko
the Russian chan@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage in fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the W@@ ada roadmap has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM welcome the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada on compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause for Russia occasion .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list however determines that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the W@@ ada approved by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to the state of state @-@ called dop@@ amine in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with respect to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ine@@ &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales centre R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not be becoming the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure your employees the luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys were not working .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers do not betra@@ y the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Reed .
she has called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement , it allows companies to provide pol@@ ls , speci@@ alising groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to deal with C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools is used by companies to measure employees &apos;s commitment .
Re@@ re@@ tt said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel with G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a He@@ at map of the company , which shows at a glance which units have most discomfort and which managers have low popularity results - so that you can drill up , why .
companies come to see that at the forefront of workplace culture must remain , so you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee has published a blog post which has been fin@@ alized by an environment of ins@@ ulators , in the those who have talked about .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is after an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value by 2020 , following the bud@@ get@@ ary website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and detect an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ everything in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ tible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible company lets tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; pol@@ ls to collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , with which the staff can report to bad behaviour .
and if the main business manager is involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found , its employees treated badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it may be costly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers @-@ fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has deployed Conver@@ tible for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their company headquarters .
earlier , if a cler@@ k wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to trace the complaints from employees .
well , since the company Conver@@ ting uses , can problems , previously used by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ even practitioner more quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and legal disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and co@@ workers engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen was collap@@ sed because of ethical obj@@ ections , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ters offer your software as a service and strain the company with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors , which support both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million for funding in February from companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has raised the total capital to $ 47 million .
the screws paid $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer venture partner and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are barely surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s staff can expect more from their jobs than before .
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bets .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company that &apos;s their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , then Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ on when their portfolio companies are well run . businesses run well if employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and deployment of employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
however , the data is useless if the administration of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees of your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and set doors .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Administration company Kot@@ ter International , which has seen itself too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of this ?
and whom do not care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Reed , which now manages monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so re@@ tt .
and after collecting feedback from frustrating staff , it was able to re @-@ organize multiple teams in the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better attachment of workers in a sector which is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose men , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it &apos;s going on at 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have drawn up their jer@@ sey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training .
for a good part of the team these un@@ just minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are ins@@ cribed to the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their audi@@ ts before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. to the water you football center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday for Tuesday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players and it has indeed renewed their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock to meet the already packed schedule of time of the players .
the compromise distance from the two days is more than a day , where the brother moved to the beginning of the camp for nearly one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold on the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add multiple routes to the player a further point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load of three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they have simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices once the camp is finished , which given the clear views of its fields from an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been ej@@ ected with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ posts , no easy task .
brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust it to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and of an exercise , it is quite a good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much for this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with Fal@@ se messages to fact audi@@ tors by third parties and then show their results under the original fee , &quot; said the world &apos;s largest online social @-@ Network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake news .
the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will begin using the use of updated machine training methods to detect possible fal@@ cons and to send it to fact audi@@ tor to display the results of the random test from the original article .
Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main plans for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of whom have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters in May with false stories were flooded , and Germany will support a plan that should be punished by social media networks if they did not succeed , h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as soon as before the elections held there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of new facts .
&quot; apart from finding out what stories of fact @-@ audi@@ ted parties are challenged , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ ress for Facebook @-@ News in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &apos; entered &apos; in connection with other changes to his news fe@@ eds to l@@ essen false news .
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a slip hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbulent history of its cozy seat at the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a cosmopolitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we@@ h@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;@@ sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book by Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter that was written by a dual agent in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b printing !
and letters always cried to smoke , because at that time , one lit a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he was even doing it .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old papers is that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have been rated my welcome &quot; ) , this seems all too beautiful to be true .
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to see the archives through and the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed hy@@ ena @-@ heads at the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscap@@ ed , gar@@ dener and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees began to look after the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , Cast it on the attic . &quot;
Ta@@ di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; one could mean that country @-@ conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families .
guys , let everything go their gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dip in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant status of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an turmoil that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle in this book with the title &apos; knee of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmers started in this area and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &quot; The Pri@@ est , &quot; which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it worker , whom the family Dar@@ rell hid seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mug@@ gler &apos; , in which the smug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is presented from the 18th century by staged his own funer@@ al by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the masters seemed to be almost infinite cro@@ o@@ er , always make debt and spend money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men rede@@ mp@@ ing their debt crises , by rich old women married - I imagine it as a he@@ ap of good @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise Er@@ land@@ nen . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique write experiences
he has taken a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic Roman above E@@ sm@@ män@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which since then has been rec@@ laimed from nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unvei@@ ling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team will hold Nelson Ar@@ tz hold the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to clearly make that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence we are convinced that we as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know about the beauty and attractiveness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the action you go to more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single ple@@ dge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other commun@@ es .
an average five @-@ digit amount is the town of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military reforms in Turkey - Sur@@ ely fear of the army
each year in early August advises in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about retirement and subsidies in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not place any more on the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office residence of the Prime Minister .
under the leadership of the government , the five vice @-@ government officials and the Minister of Defence , Justice , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the proceedings .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the over@@ number .
the government moves to the military in the military .
the General Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were deduc@@ ted .
since the failed Cou@@ p , leader Erdogan in 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile Pre@@ dig@@ ger Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len that Erdogan as the wire @-@ pul@@ lers of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved in the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdogan had referred to the ma@@ sturb@@ ating test as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but did Erdogan really control the army ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; released an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ eas@@ iness in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general strike it concerns concerns over the increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifest themselves among other things in the lifting of the head of the head ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the large construction of large in the army and security forces at any rate goes further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of July , Erdogan via decre@@ e had another 7@@ 3@@ 95 State fires , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdogan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als formerly known as the actual men of the country .
three times , they called on appeal to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the worldly state of state .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan urged the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdogan &apos;s driving forces specifically to the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a name not so @-@ called officer who seek asylum for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets this , such developments could not be cold and Nato . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , there is a doubt in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he sees to reduce the legal immigrants on 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary employment permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is meant to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do this by changing the way the US will be issued by other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the migration migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new assessment procedure will come to candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge which will benefit our economies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants route to be seen for rac@@ ec@@ tory
over the past few months over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les had been challenged - now it is going to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year , the mar@@ o@@ des track is to be built on which the tourist train is going to be built .
in order to ensure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the traffic of the traffic can begin again in this year construction work on the track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and san@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Il@@ men@@ au @-@ racing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the country has become familiar with this mainly for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Verkehrs@@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l am Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the commissioning of the distance was about 2.5 million euros .
by this sum , the land take 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , will presently be coordinated , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southeast train as the operator were already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the timetable that used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned Treaty between the ministry and the railway system will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the racing car shuttle will be ordered in December 2017 .
the racing car shuttle is one of the most popular rail links between the Il@@ men@@ au stations and the racing road .
in the past few months , during the course of a pilot plant , the track has been used by sufficiently many people to order them in the future .
the track is also in parts heavily b@@ aff@@ able .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it may not be crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex @-@ robots are at the moment a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robo@@ tik ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , em@@ eri@@ zed Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver plenty of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey to publish his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed themselves from their infl@@ atable partners with a silic@@ on skin that feels warm to the touch - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adapt its robot according to their beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot via the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it will be more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would be a step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silic@@ on skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing as for example .
and then there is still the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ ackl@@ ing and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of True companion .
so they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has their m@@ oods - like real people !
it can be tired can be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; in the mood ! &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ ordinate female properties , the all@@ u@@ sions on rape , when you get a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : reluct@@ ance ) Far@@ rah is going to im@@ poses one most .
on his website true True Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibration , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men then have no Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toys .
their formation and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , towards a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation as an optional addition .
most men will of course maintain no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes its rising popularity , they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture .
but what perme@@ ated from the edge @-@ zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not wei@@ rd or offensive , until they give the free market to them .
there is however a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a while in which the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House who tried to have women sexually attacked .
the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the sle@@ ep@@ ted body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want that they feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots represent no real women .
they cannot separate yourself from their companion or simply go away .
they have no placement or a background story , nothing which indicates the independence or anything which could dis@@ rupt the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
it has become a bin@@ der of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , who have pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate , also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ le there was newspapers in the U.S. newspapers with advice on how to deal with horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s relatives .
we urge all of us to burst our fil@@ tering bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to bring families together .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family that visited this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone she knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which they fought for decades due to the policy , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this also brings significant risks .
the left was reinforced by Tru@@ mp , but the decisive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gross@@ ly possibility that his bi@@ bs of one day will no longer be rep@@ lic@@ ated .
however , there is an even more difficult @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison with its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reasonable .
I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the hiding place - the dog on the Auto@@ roof , which looked at 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement saw ) - which both occur as very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be healthy , in order to be able to be regarded as im@@ measurable enhancement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Car@@ us@@ sel of Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ us@@ ab@@ outs of the New York department &apos;s department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ ed and the animals revol@@ ve around to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and climatic music conve@@ ys this in strange manner .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not entirely across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the topics pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , since here two hundred years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ 20 years can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have indicated the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked them afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my road it &apos;s the same , plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % drinking - this to buy something about the shop .
this leads not only to a slow@@ down of what actually a neutral exchange should be , but is also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to bring a personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ prehen@@ sive gr@@ ins@@ ing while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to the hospital with Bre@@ ache
Pist@@ ori@@ us joined the prison for the second time .
last year he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his hands that he suffered the prison guards according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ar@@ us was sentenced to an appeal for pro@@ secut@@ ors against an appeal for pro@@ secut@@ ors against an appeal for pro@@ secut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet hut in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin .
the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time to appeal against the six @-@ year imprisonment of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , of which they say , she was too thoughtful .
the national prosecution authority said that she would raise to the Supreme Court of Justice of South Africa , and the objection could be heard in this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer , he found a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the neighborhoods of F@@ guns and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and in the continued schools .
three of the kid@@ ding students in future continue to school , four to the real school .
Schul@@ tz@@ e Angel@@ ika welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bi@@ es@@ ental family in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen , on Tuesday evening .
as a symbol for school students , the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Meder chose a young eagle which grows in the chicken , but still released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ unter@@ e Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler in the chicken yard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it bro@@ o@@ unded by his chicken .
instead of a chicken ta@@ k , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make out of him a chicken sm@@ ashed , the eag@@ les spread out on a high mountain its wings , and escaped .
then the classes showed three and four in the course of study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken .
the Hen@@ nen danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cy@@ linders were wearing to the bet .
the Eagle stands for the integration , said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te .
the young is different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but they belong to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wanted every four @-@ quarters , that he feels accepted in his new school .
he followed Dan@@ kes@@ creen to the colleagues , the former school@@ manager Michael Müller , who again jumps over again at the instructor , and the parent representatives .
the kitchen @-@ time is now over , explained classroom Sophia Schu@@ macher .
she let her students spend after two years of lessons only , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the quarters of the neighborhoods .
to completion all students en@@ ring a song of summer time and holiday time .
the children got great joy with the children .
the new school year for the new school year are already registered .
two Bul@@ gar@@ s arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were de@@ tained in Greece because of illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television , with .
on the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illeg@@ ally reported men was arrested , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while currently an examination runs .
the Foreign Ministry reported b@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free camps and lay each one who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , to substantial money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

software update for diesel cars : what those who need to know now
how accurate can the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the exhau@@ st behaviour of cars of the emission classes of Euro 5 and partially euros 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in by the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the cars , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
their retro@@ fit has arranged the power @-@ drive @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a generous implementation in the coming months , but not yet an exact date .
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
if anyway an inspection is due , it will be done in their framework .
how long should the transform@@ ations take place in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the focus is on the engagement of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen voluntarily , the car manufacturers act on the issue of the environment so far not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the re@@ armament itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming might be to get an appointment .
what are drivers who have no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE reveals to the wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would re@@ tire , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is now a massive pricing of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but even in the regions , where road @-@ bot@@ e thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is no loss losses for the diesel so far .
the ACE advises , with a sale still to be seen .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center @-@ award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony at President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first r@@ apper one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the Kul@@ tu@@ re@@ ation announced on Thursday , this year the singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Ri@@ chie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograp@@ her Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) to the honoured .
the awards will be handed over in early December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is hosted a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding .
the lau@@ d winner Le@@ ar with progressive TV series announced that it is already announced to abandon the gala in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them the means - and that im@@ pe@@ des me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to clarify their view .
according to former President John F. Kennedy &apos;s Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural office in the U.S. capital .

we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ let &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes in R@@ ente next year .
the place has already been written - appropriate applicants are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work is still doing great fun as he taught in the press .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that await his successor .
at the same time , you won@@ dro@@ us that no application has been added to the requirement profile .
the city is currently seeking an architect or civil engineering at the next time .
this should - in compliance with the regular dism@@ iss@@ ant fr@@ ists - still enough time for a review .
since Has@@ lach for the Board of Directors as a sub @-@ law authority , the applicant must point out corresponding degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they can no longer fill out this , the citizens would have to travel up to Offen@@ burg .
but civil @-@ proximity is the city and itself important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good working environment as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years of office , some important projects have accumulated si@@ ties with pride .
&quot; we are making the city life worth it , &quot; he is confident about the building and its employees .
but in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the low @-@ park @-@ parking lot were about .
the Kin@@ zi@@ g@@ brücke between Boll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium is still subject .
the latter is going to beat some 1.5 million euros with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we &apos;re doing it correctly , &quot; the W@@ acker appreci@@ ates .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
visi@@ bly be present to a municipal master of great man@@ oeu@@ vre .
with ha@@ ste &apos;s own construction and gar@@ dener can be re@@ flexi@@ bly re@@ acted to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as W@@ acker , and the creation of the green plants often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye on what fits &quot; if new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the secre@@ tion of the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a building , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is running here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been able to count on many years of staff and co @-@ ordination : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been using Manfred Schön@@ er ( Free@@ building ) for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains a long way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are looking for someone who really identified and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city .
whoever wants to educate Roland W@@ acker should be a diploma or Bachelor &apos;s study with expert architecture as a diploma @-@ engineer or Bachelor &apos;s expertise in the areas of construction and construction plan .
the municipal office under@@ lies High @-@ and deep @-@ construction , construction planning , subject @-@ free affairs , administration of urban properties , municipal court and Stadt@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei as well as under@@ mining authority , including heritage conservation .
bike mounted on wir@@ es : southern ground road locked
according to the police , the far known perpetr@@ ator had thrown the blue bike from the railway station in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were badly damaged so that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and search for the night hours after them .
close to the scene were seen by witnesses a ros@@ ary Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ y stre@@ ich , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wron@@ g@@ do@@ ers would have put themselves in danger and put pressure on the train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay and the delay and the cost of rail transport , there could also be the perpetrators of the rail to the perpetrators .
overall , be from a &quot; significant &quot; sum , the speaker said .
the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern track was carried out without a disability .
nearly ten personal suits were Friday morning , two of them regard the correspondence .
Gü@@ ter@@ rains did not exp@@ ire , but they had no delay .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged about 200 meters upper lines .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
red meats , milk products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ iling )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition , affecting around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom , 300@@ ,000 affects , causing stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are normally get rid of meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washingtoner University out that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ines .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , that hide in food , do not penetrate into the body .
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , become balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissue .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bo@@ iling .
in experiments has been found that a type of tolerance promoting immun@@ o in mice occurs , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium needs Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the elements of proteins to em@@ ulate the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - who is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich diet tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal cas@@ us , if the same system is also available at people .
the post@@ do@@ k@@ tor@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study powers such cells had , but another group of the same tribe that had not been accommodated .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which usually live in the stomach intestinal tract .
the dy@@ e of mice were found DNA sequences and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without they l@@ acked with mice .
mice were raised in a mortal environment so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they were created the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria un@@ turned into the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and caused small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerant cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved itself as a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabol@@ ites that is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ bits were hal@@ ved , the number of cells declined by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes were found in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ iling disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high e@@ yp@@ top@@ ographic values can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic is committed to a genius
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut on S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pres@@ eas@@ on game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the bracket @-@ role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to mar@@ ched out .
however , MA@@ TIC was excluded from the Blues @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , which he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic star@@ ing also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent contained in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wished for three further post@@ ings , but he insisted that the Club already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of his four prime commitments .
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happier when they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. plane maker Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the US state Washington , the drawing started but in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved to the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers via the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar , the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ter was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo was painted in the sky .
new deep @-@ stop for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
however , as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , socio @-@ democratic Prime Minister before elections always been with a certain concern after Berlin .
only no stor@@ ks from the party central , merely a counter@@ wind from the Bund - the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed radically .
since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt , with increasing the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , it would not be described even in the approach .
there were deep failures .
and one by one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Cov@@ en@@ CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Green .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the un@@ ra@@ ging fac@@ tional fight of a Gre@@ ens have pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) government into a serious crisis .
five months before the Land@@ tag , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Bundes@@ chiefs Michael Kellner has prompted the ab@@ sen@@ ess low @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ ears to return their mandate .
the over@@ head to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately give her mandate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the German business leaders and electoral campaign to the green network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contaminated an SPD election campaign , as on Friday afternoon the new hi@@ ft harb@@ ours reached the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ President of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands after the trans@@ verse of the green members of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to CD@@ U without their own governance .
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD @-@ state associations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the misery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades of the time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , everything will be different .
it then became clear - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ ern , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ar@@ du@@ ly r@@ app@@ ed the comrades in the weeks afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then when they had just made new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next stop .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost in that weekend his Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in the crisis communication , it was pretty much wrong in the crisis communication , which can be done wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z fought for its political survival .
now even Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ Ab@@ g@@ asi@@ tism and its role in the Supervisory Board of the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische prime minister has been in criticism for more than some years now .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures came to be added .
nevertheless , or perhaps exactly therefore , Wei@@ l was trying to get stronger in the past weeks more and more , in the Bund acc@@ ents .
the ambition of the former Ombud@@ sman of Hannover , his power in Berlin and remained not hidden away from Martin Schulz .
they let him stand because it promised herself from Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
well , the exact opposite could arise .
in the process , Wei@@ l meets the im@@ partial internal constraints of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green in general no debt .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times the comrades try to keep the own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Green , and here above all on the ab@@ sen@@ ess parliament@@ arians of jack@@ ets .
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and more democratic , like Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets her own career eating about the interests of all the others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
MS T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected because of her person as a direct candidate , but by the national list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the decline of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on parliament@@ arians continued .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD @-@ Bundestag faction , compl@@ ained of a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate before four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as chief candidate to the Bundestag , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the personal career prospects for a future CD@@ U MEPs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I will know if there has been more or it has given further commitments to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
Sup@@ porting Society for Ort@@ k@@ ern III
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to be re@@ fine in the years can soon get support from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg urban development on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler was once again looking back on the previous events .
since 1991 it has been in delicate san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the past renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior design , and not just tap into new areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4th you have received the information from the government of the government in Karlsruhe that there will be a re@@ organisation III .
the funding amount 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which rose 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest from the community .
what is a re@@ development ?
one will continue to examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role whether in the intended territory to be in any interest , to san@@ itation .
if necessary , the territory will be able to postp@@ one another again .
the jet@@ ty appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ es@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the content of the federal government @-@ country programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; within which the re@@ markings would then be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of Inn@@ es , the improvement of the living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , which means a property .
the re@@ organisation would finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the funding period for the funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
even until September of this year , however , it would only once again be carried out the inventory , as part of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment region , to fill out a questionnaire for filling out a questionnaire .
in November or December the statutes shall be made possible , so that in the coming year it will begin with the re@@ markings .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stressed that any Comm@@ une that had to perform the said pre @-@ examinations .
it is to evaluate and decide the urban abnorm@@ alities and decide when sandy is to be cleared and to what extent .
a san@@ atorium on the ground floor will also be included for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ z@@ mann will come again in again and get a picture of the location , she spoke .
in addition , a significant success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens over the next few weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; property and plot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is related to the construction and refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of an apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; factory bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if in the building business rooms are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it should be noted that Got@@ zel pointed out that a more fulfilling questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ve measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler pointed out that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; wind@@ y principle &quot; - who comes first , gr@@ ates first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no support for the promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ k@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shown to make the present a restructuring of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor reveals itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand@@ movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger and now provides the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has worked together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ a@@ es@@ thes@@ ists at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant process is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles in houses and cars that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising cost of the White House cost the tax@@ payers .
the decision of the White House , a naval helicopter to fly to South La@@ wn for an event that costs American production last month , costs tax@@ payers according to the military data that have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president on board was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter was made in Connecticut in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift truck from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , after the Hel@@ icop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn @-@ lan@@ ted , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , deputy Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ ders for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter held on 17 July at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn on the event at 3 pm , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that , in case of departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the lessons a second team would require for the flight back .
the original plane was during the event at the helicopter , while the safety staff of unity during the period remained on the ground by plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second aircraft was required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits Bundes@@ an@@ ed , stat@@ eless property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event might hurt the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; answered the deputy commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he p@@ aired the efforts for cur@@ v@@ ature of government legislation .
making use of the airplane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly any new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but your use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tru@@ mp was conducted in February an investigation as the presidential aircraft in the background of his first fight @-@ day in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and its Twitter account is full of announcements that can be described above the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessors .
&quot; the White House is impressed by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said Wal@@ ters to the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to de@@ comp@@ ose the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters .
as Tru@@ mp at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 exercise periods .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event included in the training needs of the plane for the month , said an official .
hel@@ i@@ kop@@ ter units flew in addition 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential commission . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ payers were the burden for none of the other re@@ qu@@ is@@ ites presented at the event .
a speaker of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in placing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget awards for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the support staff of the U.S. Defense Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D reimbur@@ sement for the v@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit check the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tax@@ payers are to commit tax@@ payers on the basis of estimates for re@@ funds , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates contain staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the revenues for DO@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contractual agreements .
at that time the former Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ acher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ru@@ bles , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state Connecticut very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for whom many Americans have worked tirel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course adequate to emphas@@ ise this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he stepped up his circuit via the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fighter .
in the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

team Chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay at any rate has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays a quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
right at the rear positions I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V ensure imports from the high north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to work in the Davis Cup .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes as always hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you also need a good deal of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the Trip to the high north is practical .

how America can harm O@@ MV
really happy was Donald Tru@@ mp did not , when he de@@ tained his signature under the law for ag@@ grav@@ ating sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his h@@ ast , the law en@@ acted , the Congress adopted a few &quot; constitutional rules , &quot; added to .
also the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels over@@ turned against the US push .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the draft states to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the domestic O@@ MV are concerned , which together with other European companies financed the construction of the Russian Ost@@ ro@@ g@@ ung Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ ape is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil concert .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp itself had to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .
twelve weapons stand for him at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at what the Group could rep@@ el and which could really do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , is unvei@@ led , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from above .
the season three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest mi@@ xes of the show .

role backward : the city provides 46 kitchen staff
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ L@@ unch itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock was turned back in the urban day@@ care centres .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply to the urban nursery for day@@ care ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ie , deputy leader in the specialist area of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked still out of house : a Cater@@ er takes over this task and supplies fresh p@@ iled cool@@ ed .
the town operates in the area of 46 children &apos;s centres in the area of 46 children &apos;s centres , in 44 the children are given a warm meal .
last year @-@ year @-@ year , 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 years old in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 p.m. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 sub @-@ time forces have warm the food for the 1st of September : they ra@@ ving the food dishes , supplement it to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individual , give the food out , clean , flush and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ism .
the size - there are two @-@ group@@ ed just like se@@ mit@@ es facilities - decides on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the chef now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for kitesur@@ fing to realize educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this is why it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help to prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is wise .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will be done in future by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen , has also the charm that it has placed in the cost comparison between the self @-@ reg@@ al and foreign exchange for the city as the economical one , it is from the press office .
and that even though 46 sub @-@ time forces will be re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall within approximately 750 people in the gu@@ ardi@@ ans area not so strong &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;

GM@@ B concerns about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to join managers of the Bis@@ cu@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie about the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B Scotland said the company talked about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which includes beside other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscu@@ its .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owners Pla@@ dis said he has invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the Fili@@ p@@ ite of the company , we called the GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns that the funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be accelerated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; our members deeply concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workforce focused strongly on the local community and the generosity of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of living and the chronic production of production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needed a thri@@ ving production case at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ cross won only yesterday a letter from GM@@ B Scotland and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meetings with employees and GM@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the staff that we are active as all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , our stores regularly review - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested over 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and completely . should our operational processes change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga likes to regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain does not exp@@ ire in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after having released an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million in order to trigger its fre@@ ew@@ heel clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world war ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete of the world . PS@@ G offers more than 500,000 GB@@ P per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way to the outside , although there is a source near the Catal@@ ans state that the club has always given his best to care for himself since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of the prospect ?
in Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact her players &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players at yourself , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish Association the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prizes for N@@ ey@@ mar .

in the area of the center of Stol@@ zen@@ au it came towards it a car on its lanes , so he had to go to the right .
in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ ted the Leit@@ plan@@ ke .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may well be good according to the accident that the Mer@@ ge drivers had not noticed the accident at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ report un@@ load Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on the abuse of abuse is reli@@ eved by Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on mis@@ sc@@ andal among the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen provides further discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; explained to the publication of the German press agency , he anticipated by the former Regen@@ sburger Bishop and today &apos;s Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year &apos;s brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse .
it would highly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however critici@@ zed that in the coverage of violence against the sp@@ at@@ ts with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two things &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the gri@@ ps in Regensburg no one doubt that it is about &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; which must be punished and prevented in the future ; but stri@@ k@@ ingly the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and preparing public opinion that is normal to normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will be happy to go to the church and that is a found fresh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes a quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I was one , ready to be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you find it unfair to use today &apos;s standards for earlier decades because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , the Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is often p@@ aired .
completely wrong , says author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the mem@@ or@@ ative band &quot; My brother of Pope &apos; ( in 12 languages ) .
&quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; adds the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which was presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were aged between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high Pl@@ au@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it was said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was held in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. were applied in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be disastrous .
nevertheless , contrary to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in many cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the abuse of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; incidents of violence against the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for a great many students lift up his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a Ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ec@@ tionary , who became the presence of the O@@ f@@ teren , if a domain @-@ record has not brought top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger generally occurs at all .
he is dedicated to eight pages just once and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of the abet@@ ting or toge@@ ther@@ ness in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the acts of violence on the pre @-@ school occurred outside of its sphere of sphere .
you can pre @-@ throw it at all , from which too late or initial announcements are not taken seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the count@@ down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at which he worked , was felt by practically all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also produces an excellent record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincerely &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that the guys regularly served with cakes , biscu@@ its and car@@ ts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always used by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tionist and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to be@@ ut@@ ations .
that he did not only cast him with chairs and cast the key step to the ground , but also ear @-@ cow@@ ard@@ ly distributed and too s@@ assy boys in the hair or ears , he gave himself too many years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and exc@@ used for it .
to his honor of salvation , however , must be said that such education methods in the questionable era , the 1960s and 1970s were widely used , with parents as at teachers .
do you still know such breeding @-@ methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a se@@ cular school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared to what it is all about in this report , namely the de@@ voting sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , they certainly are dre@@ dging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then one wonders whether it is not to deal with his acquain@@ t@@ edness and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media had just begun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many people have never been able to understand it , still more ze@@ able .
the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media in connection with the report was much reported on the subject of abuse of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put a burden on sexual abuse in the final report as well as with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual over@@ gri@@ ps claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were sanc@@ tified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a du@@ bi@@ er substitute for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem with the explanation of sexual abuse has been and yet is that most of the victims remain silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ pupils R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a qualified students form@@ ulate it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in the b@@ los@@ ers ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely findings and could have had the offen@@ ders .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that out of him ... Bu@@ ben more pressing or more clearly or rather opened , than opposite to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ or managers , confidence instruc@@ tors etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance the students and / or their environment trusted , it could not be confirmed as part of the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is to be shared by any sympathy .
so he cannot be accused of having not prevented him or have brought him to display .
therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these resistance crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was taken away in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big issue that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a vast mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the midst of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly the case of abuse of the report .
namely , there is clean separate : between the pre @-@ school and the grammar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , we say again , other pr@@ elimin@@ aries .
in addition , the report deals with the incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir leader of the cathedral .
the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases , in which l@@ ad of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were hoo@@ ked and mal@@ ign@@ ites , un@@ folded , all on the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen und P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be ruled out .
but with whom had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the back @-@ up of the crew .
on this was how most witnesses emphasize , the subject &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different on the back @-@ show ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there have been discipline , but just not di@@ shar@@ k violence .
and that also applies to George R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;
so there is not yet the accus@@ ation to be away .
however , despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was not responsible for the processes at a school where he was not engaged and responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then just back in 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently disappeared the ears at the intervals ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the sp@@ lin@@ eup which was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he pointed out this to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ et continue to be practi@@ sed in the test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative statistics , he recommended inv@@ ari@@ ably inv@@ ading .
that was of course at a time when legal clarity existed as a test case had long been banned in Bavaria too .
before , they occurred in a legal gray area , like everyone of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate , where the persons affected are perhaps exaggerated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limits had been exceeded .
but one can also not say he always had taken away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the examination of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis have claimed it be unfair to apply the guidelines for the time today .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we were talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is to rate the danger of the past moral mass@@ acres .
there the princess is already right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what was broken up in pre @-@ school in opposition and violence to inno@@ cent children &apos;s ri@@ mp@@ s , which already goes far beyond that of that time .
this is all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally work .
but at the same time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must take shelter in protection , because all of this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. po@@ inters and in the hair and ears to pull , were widely used in the 1970s .
as physical funer@@ al then it was forbidden , he has also kept strictly in it .
what picture of his Rain@@ sburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger returned in talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
did the test also come to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts X@@ V@@ I. , tells of his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ ts played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I did not conc@@ ede that he caused a stric@@ ter Regim@@ ent there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tionist , without calling for unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural harb@@ ours of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscu@@ its and cho@@ col@@ ates alone , one does not even make a big singer and before every success , equal to which area but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person you have experienced George R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work at the book and in addition I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well known and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep believers and sav@@ vy good people from which you cannot imagine that he could not do just a fly of a fly .
I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ ts still get in touch with him today , 23 years after his embar@@ go , regularly visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who have not for@@ given him to this day , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are today grateful to him that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always was a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but yet a lovely respect person was to look at it today and honor them almost .
and please , once again quite clear : all that you pres@@ et him are gu@@ ardi@@ ce methods , which were at the time of the day .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is also prominent and has an even prominent brother to make a medi@@ al s@@ cap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that behind it , only too obvious .
because the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves it .
now the an@@ alogue would stand , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , finally in peace .
