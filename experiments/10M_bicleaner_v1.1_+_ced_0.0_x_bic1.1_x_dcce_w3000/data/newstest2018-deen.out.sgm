<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards, which change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit lane, where now is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small resser cultivating the sticking reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to spend days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys if land maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to go upright, because the auto-Navi took place in a green meadow instead of a bypassing road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current - yet very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current on-line cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a splatchwork which one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Into the great postcard-card, for cities and communities were more detailed cards, so-called urprints, incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were formed according to the Bayerischer Vermessaging management between 1810 and 1864 and unjump the first Vermessung Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Koalitioner with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an topographic record of Bayerns on behalf - naturally for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops went off with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbors, which crafted the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV made the project progressing, the" "" "topographic Bureau" "" "set up the" "" "topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional blatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the Internet site of the Bayerisches Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the morning / Today the state capital is most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendner was founded in 21 years after the map, so 1877, as a Münchner district invaded.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today subsendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses submissions focus on 1856 along the today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after 1878 Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in addition, a smaller-part card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbering consists of the so-called "Urgent" from which the tax tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels do not occupy longer than farmers today - but small resser of the plant "land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 place of the October festo, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete form.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar there is an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urpositional leaf, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, it reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the ascent "On the ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, we once again close people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner district-Irrenanstalt" "" "was created in the Auer ventilation." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard joined the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought to King Ludwig's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ankhing of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">He also allowed the staff to use violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first place, later on 500 places was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity also did not leave any more - the reason for the construction of the circular prison in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There has been the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the Areal of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Munich's Salesanium.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth-home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV München East, east residential-houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015 the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "- in architectural approach to the origin of the irrename, was destroyed during the Second World War." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz" "" "was by 1856 as" "" "head place" "", "the shopping street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought about the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained to this day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a trench chapel from the Middle Ages were once occupied by the Marienhof, where these days were the pre-work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking for the second S-Bahn conference.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole on the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights published travel plans for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Farmers' promotion has issued a warning for color of coloured people who are traveling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP travel Advisory for the federal state Missouri, which will bring special attention until 28 August 2017, while travelling through the state, bring special attention and express the first caution because a number of fragmented, rubs-based allegations occur in recent times throughout the state and here," "" "says it in the opinion of the group." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to gain discriminalisation, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionately on minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of the citizen's rights, the people are happening." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri (NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear discomfort in such an incidence we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited cases like racist verge against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">He died at the beginning of the year, after having no gasoline anymore during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out to a recent report by the Office of the General Assembly of Missouri in which black drivers in the state will hold 75 per cent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and about their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri" "", "says Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring if it's Caution money or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate speech in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate speech reporting program of the FBI, which puts the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Law that would make it more difficult, a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberal Union (ACLU) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states to pledge immigration laws, to betray people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further margins in view of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries but lately the measure has been used as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Consecrated project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherbacher Weidespn-Project is a success project and continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag, Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the disposal of the family of Schwendemann, representatives of the Fisherbacher CDU-local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann stood first insights into his operations, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows and also many young animals and in five apartments are served in the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="72">The Black Forest "milk is for him of alternative marketers for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste only comes to regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also called BLHV Chairman of Fisherbach, he described the" "" "elementary" "" "project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot act on such steep surface profitable.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green spaces for a lot of work, much must be worked with the motorbike.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he do not lead a biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the significance of the Weiler project and is happy about the leaders." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers would have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the forestation of the surface could be drawn up for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure that we have is, are people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry their business," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism due to funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open air surface area is 40 hectares, which must not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total of the total population of 71 500 Euro was promoted by the total population of 71 500 euros, a quarter was carried by the Municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers lost 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of Weidefence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and housewives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weatherproof:" "" "the best food is produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape of Landscape (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of Weidetentious.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the manifestation of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Requirement is the presence of one of the LPR recorded funding schemes.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "furthermore, the tenuous area must not be sweppery (Hangout about 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by forestation." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherman's hamlet Project 2018, the application of eight participants is running with 24 parcels, which would like to build just 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open space corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking off the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic session with Jim Acosta by CNN about the proposals of President for drastic restrictions on legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller attacked not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty Imitators would have wracked it if he did it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it attacked their significance, and in particular the meaning that you have been attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "as Miller Acosta," "" "I don't want to enter a full thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he himself formulate himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporaneous resonance of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your poor, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who are longing for free to breathe, / the elting waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable trash" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps US.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural argument: it is in fact a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who put themselves to place their words on the base after their death - did very well that they had accomplished a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classical image.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this long time from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The large scream rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was anyone invaded not, but rather an early Neocon that bring the American flame into the umented world: "Lady Liberty is going forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh found here on something razor.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and certainly a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they saw from the creative, miserable, but hopeful men after long and often terrible journeys on the Decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people, seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome, which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective, the Miller and Trump will ever wish to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch shall not enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle reminded itself of a time when only two carrots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eiliie Doyle was chosen by the team to team place.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics about Facebook: take you not to a public office if you can not tolerate the halting of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of the poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers took him because of everything, from domestic policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He swept in criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb we will be guided like the sheep for the slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland at Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogoers employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people and have voiced their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberal Union complained about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The cry of the Governors allowed the lawsuit was frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na," and? "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like hoganese.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest priority of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary trend.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with its voters and to debate his hair-loose head following chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of people who come to the Governors side - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by co-workers who are paid with public tax dollar - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan Checker defended the acts of Governors and argued that the comments of the comments were nothing more than a moderation.</seg>

<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG needs to point out at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million) to buy the Brazilians from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make sure that Neymar submits it to Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team through the rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to get a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to be controlled with legitimate use of revenue, which enable them to reach the Crusak point inside their on the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election at the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken tremendous debt in their quest for success, effectively cheating and riskicked to ruin, if banks or owners returned their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP moved from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The amendment meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested heavily in building up the crew and build a global brand - to a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, Clubs may take losses in the amount of €30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in the ungnade, its UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains to be deterred by excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will re-step up the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, towards The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out-clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so that the solution for the next five years can be expired in the amount of €44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine penalty of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to list its financial supervision by holding their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could transpose the PSG if the value of sponsoring the standard market rates would exceed, the UEFA would do not have this as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the PSA's value was blown by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar on payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2006 could come in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar WM's ambassadors will be able to find out and one such manoeuvre for UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The existing sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to take care of the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG on Neymars transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.2 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year must be published further.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship Deals, merchandising and tripping purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars departure by saying that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "co-operation" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership in PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1170">But in question only Swiss producers come.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper's report Chocolat Frey wants to strive for a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Chocolate boards have been distributed in Swiss since 2006 on board their flights.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia is going into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-er years, for the 90-years Grunge era (as the Vordenker David Wain and Michael Show old die Sketch comedy for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise, it feels like the time was short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, not only because of its absurd lobors (it contained an original story for a speaking Dose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By turning to the core of the Gags - actors have been vaccinated children, which will grow up - they nevertheless have the impossibility to regain the last part of the weather.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years later," with his adults, who are now adults playing is less emotional and his parody continues to become more emotional, including a reef to the Stalker's films of the 90-he years like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that smiles the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">A character by an Apple-PowerBook, some Inline Skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showold), now Romantor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost its virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy malignant pin, involved in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Show old), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always the exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dos sublippenche of "singles," whose former big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It is the moments random madness, that could make this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches that which I will show as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years', whose last scene will show the gang on how they will visit the film premiere of" Wet Hot American Summer "</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminded of a different kind of nostalgia: at the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "Glow" with its East-against-West Ringbattle-Ikonography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created Comedy with Rhys Thomas as director, a found TV show: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main troduction - a hard-ottener Gregor and an idealistic isef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogs of Channing Tatum (also a executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt will be synced in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags about watching (the police spends the time playing chess on TV as Americans might do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speaker - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game of finding out the voice.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is involved very much for the truthfulness of a dubious propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it is often like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">In six long episodes it moves there, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective" which has been rearranged on a smaller length could provide its agitprop satire better, since Gregor and Ioózsef visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devouring a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the untrained communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for fodder.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resumed 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne did not pack her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I searched for something that was comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I love me in her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment was completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a welded layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and one mezzanine to best use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted to high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">This was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she asked the architecture and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi made of Notting Hill to make the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative to solve the reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is rather complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stranded by each other without we had to snails." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform but to lay the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or at the bottom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled it Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with lots of extra Drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copic window of rerouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold-furniture, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding the theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make him longer work.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The kitchen feels the mirror as a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units space for all the triangles and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garandoor.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of Engineering went in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important, so it is when you slide the door very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the basic space - or how your property will be appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate broker will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they managed to enlarge the surface area and at the same time use high quality materials, which offers the space its luxurious benefit.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore help create an emotional connection in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love yourself in the electrical socket in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new staff leader is planning to restrict the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly could actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in the hope to hold the boss on a more equal course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new staff leader of the White House, took place at his first working day with managerial staff, he presents a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wants to repair: poor information that came into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefing - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV still is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Candidate was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince," said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to hold Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials therein, to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise price."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter-habit has ever been" "" "under control" "", "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these fight officials know something we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets could not contain even more ignities without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that the Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees had made it several times to keep away from him, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it, that Trump Controls out.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people together in a white house that puts out of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by promoting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to lead the president for strategic reasons beyond doubt.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example, described by porter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump-officials say that Trump like a Volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks and that he will find out how these stem from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This happened in late February when someone had malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocalist Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy rod of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banished because of rakanen permanently from Twitter or that he did not provide any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoke them from the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the then staff leader Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage the paperwork and document the Trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be opened on March 1st next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">After the closing of the hotel Birkenhof through the then ambience operating company mbH and 13 April 2014, approximately 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenues from the city tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In fall 2014, in the face of dramatically rising numbers of refugees who arrived in the county, the hotel building of the Landmark Office, as collective accommodation, was offered for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the presence of an development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was at that time in the community at that time undisputed.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadts Oberbourgeois-Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of more serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group of Luisenhof with businessman Birgit Scherer with seat in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in bad mountaineering, and one in Bad Men's.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are called Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof already stand for long time construction containers in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation works will be carried out.</seg>

<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms seems to set itself wide, explains Scheler.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual holiday makers, groups or businessmen should feel at ease in the hotel.</seg>

<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">After the amount of investment was asked, Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under a million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">Also the outdoor facilities are brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.</seg>

<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand juries is to examine and decide the evidence in possible breakdown and decide whether charge is required.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called dock.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when it deals with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the Prosecutor to invite people to disintegrate under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the Sender CNN, preliminary entries have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Individuals who were involved in the meeting were summoned to a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. there were also Trumps adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his daman election manager Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-wing extremists said on Thursday night in US television that show that Mueller will not let him shook in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the substitution of the Gremium is the beginning of a new phase in research and a new reason to concern President Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1505">But they usually work in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocated any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent to "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI leader James Comey said three times that he will not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to suppose that something changed in it, it meant that it was in the explanation.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce met each other, in order to review their plans for the coverage of the recent chaos in the State Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about certainty.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it's important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists will discuss what to feel safer: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words to a blackboard on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and paces.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are absenting on the enclosure of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no escape from violence, and during all the land the corpses, more and more journalists are at stake: at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 has brought up his office. 589 stood by attacks and threats to Bundesschutz und till now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Under the latter you find editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence associated with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its absence will be deeply saddened, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows his middle-finger with the word "Justice," depends on the facade of Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmare, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 was established a Sonder's office to edit the cases of journalists, this has started under the committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely put on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">On Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are untracked and even though the terrain is now in stock.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderer, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to squander my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know the Why we mistrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15, Valdez abandoned the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to sail a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap ran away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez has been 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to wander freely around in Cuxacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of kept, two-story Mausoleans for drug Pills, which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs called drugs in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez has been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt shattered that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival carttions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected bormembers bought each copy of the issue once they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was in it, Valdez did not compel to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, leaving the country into its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived his friends and colleagues that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he had gathered together with five colleagues for the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without bothering to the rudote problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the moment the paper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and the sales and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to be tough apt to post censorship without fear of censorship, and the readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors" Cabot Prize "for its coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it lead.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living" "", "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce-Team miss Valdez, the fun-bird, who was curable like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher, who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, go and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced her to ask her own assumptions on how to do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their canny runway and runways" to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust their own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened by Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are not in Sinaloa no more - just as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, guerrero and other states where a poisonous blend of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees met of Riodoce for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days earlier has been known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for the monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">They sought two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Cuxacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, some of the reporter, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, who referred to the governor itself as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous terrain, where the drug gangs are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has led to three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to the state spending, which focused on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that was located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cuxacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor's office, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who kidnapped or how it happened so it was advisable to write when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy, the governing Institutional Revolution Party (Pri) belongs to nearly all political planes.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors were accused of corruption because of highly-consuming cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporters to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman was entailed a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez has been devoted to storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporin Ramirez Miriam Ramirez snapped out a few characters and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1891">On that day the director Bojorquez took away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez accused the authorities to pick up journalists and get rid of them because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since been asked to be divided by the government because it is concerned that their anger has hurt their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, by participating government officials and an equivalent society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"" "in his last book" "" "Narco-Journalism" "", "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug users, but also on orders of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a blanket." ""</seg>

<seg id="1926">The report in the magazine "Current Biology," described it as "the animated dinosaurs, which was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered kind of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well preserved state has researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-fresser is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he found on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, den.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something which seemed from the surrounding rocks at the plane, and decided to see more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil was discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">You spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) serious peens.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're just a little with your eyes flashes, you could almost believe it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best surviving dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that these herbivores, although it is covered with armor and is similar to a changing tank, probably by meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly-armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a paragliding that is used as a counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to dodge its enemies, saying experts, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier was made for the first time headlines in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta Markmitchelli according to the Museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-cladding, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means the peak of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the cladding is common the results are surprising, because the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaurs was hunted by enough pressure by meat-filled dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation with the confrontation was favored as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that employ the counter-cladding - think of deer, zebras, or bells - are much smaller and more vulnerable as booty, which signaled that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, highly-armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the chalk-time," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows that the skin of the dinosaur was maroon.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal in references about his life, including his conserving Darmintes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs when he died, driven into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as the South-orida today, and rivers and oceans once more widespread than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preservative skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and the original form of the beast," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early crayon time." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only do a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is on sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time, as a huge Therseropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, who were standing on two legs, the earth passed.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived for millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors.</seg>

<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was buried after death in the sea and in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he found on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, den.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the animated dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to the hips.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tops, which were raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant-vores was curved by the Western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>

<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still bumpy armor plate along the dinosaurs.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass-scale period.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous Verlast, kilometric Staus - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), on the late Thursday afternoon, approximately 20 people have been injured.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first information from the police were between 5: 00 pm between the Connected Adelzhausen und Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 cars, among them probably also trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Above the exact number of the publishers, there were no indications.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It is light to moderate serious injury, a police force said.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large listing of rescue vehicles was at the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich.</seg>

<seg id="1993">The German railways currently test the creator control card.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by phone that you have taken his place and devaluated the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently there is a test run on two tracks.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To make use of this, however, some conditions must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already has the most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You have to also have bought it via the app of rail, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket bucket.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis, on the bed of an Airbnb-apartment, which rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18-year-old child and it still lies on the street" "", "it was called there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, as nobody else had posted on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was continually deployed to their timeline reweave.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was involved, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., killed, live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He pounding a picture of Browns a naked body that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "this is wild," "" "said Ferrell at himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone in order to return to Tweets on the Canfield drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, the crying, and of a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feeds in which a policeman has stood before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, uninsured another policeman is his rifle and cried," "" "I will kill you... animals all" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not customary," Ferrell remembered her statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can call it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt bulk.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a flight and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she fetched their 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and the protest, of love and loss, of strength and loss of resistance, which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell took with her daughter, which wore a flower dress and a matching crown, the two went to Ferguson, followed the two times before this morning "over the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember as I have taught you when black people have to fight for that which they believe?" "" "she reminded what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not true." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take them, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past." ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">You need to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It has to be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the luck, to give her an experience where she personally does not experience a blatant racism, it is no other than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel, I would give her a bad service to keep them away from away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that was turned into a camp as the activists were waiting for the possible non-trial by Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner, who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly started to accept a new type of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after the 9th of August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black churches.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted merely to document, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to the point:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white men - in a community dedicated to their pain and their watttivity.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, known for his activism around Todestrakt.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought the project closer together with six other natives, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" over the years to Browns promise.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people are presented, as I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it is in motion "not to have a" Messiah "leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most revealed participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets" "" "show signs of" "" "Whose Streets" "" "?" "" "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrer's life as she loves and marries her wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," he said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be certain vulnerability during this work and in the dehumanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrer's story repeated the role of black gay women in the wider black-lives matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement that after the killings of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and hence we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must wear the last load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to notice that" "" "the movement really is kept up by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it is assumed that" "" "this is no affirmatically type of action," "" "was chosen as the heart of the film in the herell because of their identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who came up this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence, although it was on the front line because with a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras had gone by Ferguson since then, but the racical connections between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is at stake for 2 ½ years due to the blockage of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area they call her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">However, she cled to a vocals and she feels bound to this memory, since she went into Ferguson the road three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">"" "to discuss" "" "dream" "" ": TV-readers to discuss bit-gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the Süver of the pedestrian precinct since the first presentation of 2009 split the population into proponents and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "People freund Bitburg" the issue is discussed.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While proponents build on it that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, from which also the rest of the shops are benefiting, the opponent fear that then the pedestrian precinct.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery will be designed exactly on the property, where the farm market hall is, in which 13 direct markers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will be the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in new construction - and to the Beda square with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we've been buying a weekly market hall for many years now.</seg>

<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that we at least retain the Markthalle.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered is fresh, is largely offered directly from the producer and is completely inexpensive.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticeable similar - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuplift and hair-sections created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts taken out of the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst took a 35-year prison sentence, having publicly made diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks's website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Become resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and repellent disappearances, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has extracted the algorithms of DNA which could be extracted from Manning and was created out of 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the induress determinism of these interpretations, but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, was openly spoken since their puberty, was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 accusations, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a baskets, black-white selector, in which Manning is visibly sitting on a driver seat and a burst blonde with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg had just returned from the great success of their 2012-project 'stranger'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist's portraits of strangers made of forensic artifacts such as cigarette smoker and chewing gum by extraction the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their detained Muse were interchangeable for the same letters, which in the course of two years were interchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic Images, "which foresee a future which would dictate the President Chelo judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years was asked in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happenings.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep in opening the exhibition, as Donald Trump performs a war against informants from government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweet ways that he should actually fix, continue to inflame.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she told that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a written artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with their oversized signature including (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and GS and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or Nuclotide to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring with it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition which is stored in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned comic noelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as it comes up with a Freisprechtelefon in the hands of the disciplinarctic of the United States, like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "when they put your speech, then they have won" "", "it says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "so never stop the mouth." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "I still get lost, if I am talking about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the center of the room of the masks, from their own genomic simulators, which coincides with hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It was also focused, as everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), where their genetic drivers have been written with pencils.</seg>

<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant-chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has deployed Convertible for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their company headquarters.</seg>

<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors, which support both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million for funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The screws paid $10 million in November by Bessemer venture partner and brought its total funding to $60 million.</seg>

<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and deployment of employees, it's no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on the employee's commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">However, the data is useless if the administration of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees of your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and set doors.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Administration company Kotter International, which has seen itself too much on collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it may not be crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are at the moment a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotik) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emerized Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University Sheffield and Co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver plenty of it and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey to publish his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed themselves from their inflatable partners with a silicon skin that feels warm to the touch - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also adapt its robot according to their beliefs" "" "and select everything from the eye-colour of the robot via the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it will be more disturbing, as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "", "which would be a stepford-woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing as for example.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shackling and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the site of True companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So they like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has their moods - like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired can be fixed on conversation or she can be "in the mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subordinate female properties, the allusions on rape, when you get a step on Frigid (i.e. here: reluctance) Farrah is going to imposes one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true True Roxxxy with a vibration, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibration, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course maintain no sex robots, and while the FRR notes its rising popularity, they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeated from the edge-zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or offensive, until they give the free market to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a while in which the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House who tried to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the Magd ') are not the graphical pictures, the sleepted body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want that they feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots represent no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate yourself from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or a background story, nothing which indicates the independence or anything which could disrupt the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrase of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of the healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binder of the Trump era that the political divisions, who have polarized the U.S. electorate, also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankle there was newspapers in the U.S. newspapers with advice on how to deal with horror of Trump's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We urge all of us to burst our filtering bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-oriented poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family that visited this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with which they fought for decades due to the policy, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was reinforced by Trump, but the decisive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the grossly possibility that his bibs of one day will no longer be replicated.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more difficult-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the right wing, "which suddenly appear in comparison with its standards as the epitome of reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of the hiding place - the dog on the Autoroof, which looked at 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement saw) - which both occur as very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must be healthy, in order to be able to be regarded as immeasurable enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the Carussel of Central Park, the biggest of the carusabouts of the New York department's department, and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scared and the animals revolve around to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and climatic music conveys this in strange manner.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines are becoming familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not entirely across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the topics pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, since here two hundred years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-20 years can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have indicated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked them afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my road it's the same, plus the option to buy the rating with a 15% drinking - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This leads not only to a slowdown of what actually a neutral exchange should be, but is also exerting pressure on the server to bring a personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apprehensive grinsing while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius moved to the hospital with Breache</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius joined the prison for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his hands that he suffered the prison guards according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistarus was sentenced to an appeal for prosecutors against an appeal for prosecutors against an appeal for prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet hut in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder, hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention, this time to appeal against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius appeal, of which they say, she was too thoughtful.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The national prosecution authority said that she would raise to the Supreme Court of Justice of South Africa, and the objection could be heard in this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meats, milk products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory boiling)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, affecting around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom, 300,000 affects, causing stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are normally get rid of meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University out that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes, that hide in food, do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation, become balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory boiling.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments has been found that a type of tolerance promoting immuno in mice occurs, which carry a certain bacterium in their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the elements of proteins to emulate the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - who is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan-rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal casus, if the same system is also available at people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study powers such cells had, but another group of the same tribe that had not been accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the stomach intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The dye of mice were found DNA sequences and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without they lacked with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a mortal environment so that a intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they were created the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria unturned into the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and caused small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unmature immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved itself as a by-product of the tryptophan-metabolites that is known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptopbits were halved, the number of cells declined by half.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-report unload Pope Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of abuse is relieved by Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on misscandal among the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are church," explained to the publication of the German press agency, he anticipated by the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year's brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would highly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false evaluation of operations.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "however criticized that in the coverage of violence against the spatts with" "" "two things" "" "measured." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the grips in Regensburg no one doubt that it is about "shameful and shameful deeds" which must be punished and prevented in the future; but strikingly the "degree of media manipulation," said the author of the National Italian Bioethics committees.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and preparing public opinion that is normal to normal" "", "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "the Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk" "" ":" "" "you will be happy to go to the church and that is a found fresh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, she pointed out that in her youth," "" "strikes a quite normal pedagogical means" "", "" "" "as I was one, ready to be done." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">You find it unfair to use today's standards for earlier decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, the Pope Georg Ratzinger is often paired.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger the memorative band "My brother of Pope '(in 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take care of Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," adds the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which was presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were aged between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high Plauts" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it was said to Georg Ratzinger, who was held in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, so that by Domkapellmeister R. were applied in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, contrary to numerous other accusations, many victims are estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore, in many cases, despite violence even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hesemann, why the final report on the abuse of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the "incidents of violence against the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a great many students lift up his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a Choleriker and Perfectionary, who became the presence of the Ofteren, if a domain-record has not brought top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask why the name Georg Ratzinger generally occurs at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages just once and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the abetting or togetherness in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the acts of violence on the pre-school occurred outside of its sphere of sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can pre-throw it at all, from which too late or initial announcements are not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "the countdown" "" "at which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - as literally -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "so the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also produces an excellent record," "" "sincerely" "", "" "", "competent," "", "" "" "competent," "", "" "" "competent," "", "that the guys regularly served with cakes, biscuits and carts and" "" "always used by grapes of children." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about its perfectionist and its high emotionality, which also led to beutations.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only cast him with chairs and cast the key step to the ground, but also ear-cowardly distributed and too sassy boys in the hair or ears, he gave himself too many years ago, deeply regretted and excused for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honor of salvation, however, must be said that such education methods in the questionable era, the 1960s and 1970s were widely used, with parents as at teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding-methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is all about in this report, namely the devoting sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, they certainly are dredging.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "" "" "then one wonders whether it is not to deal with his acquaintedness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media had just begun." ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope, many people have never been able to understand it, still more zeable.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report is relieved Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media in connection with the report was much reported on the subject of abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put a burden on sexual abuse in the final report as well as with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual overgrips claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were sanctified.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said a dubier substitute for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the explanation of sexual abuse has been and yet is that most of the victims remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-pupils Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a qualified students formulate it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in the blosers (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely findings and could have had the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that out of him... Buben more pressing or more clearly or rather opened, than opposite to their parents, internator managers, confidence instructors etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance the students and / or their environment trusted, it could not be confirmed as part of the examination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be shared by any sympathy.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of having not prevented him or have brought him to display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these resistance crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media was much of" "" "violence" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was taken away in the report" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big issue that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a vast melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the midst of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the case of abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there is clean separate: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, we say again, other preliminaries.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with the incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases, in which lad of sadistic teachers were hooked and malignites, unfolded, all on the pre-school in Etterzhausen und Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the back-up of the crew.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On this was how most witnesses emphasize, the subject "Vorschule" tabu. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the back-show?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there have been discipline, but just not dishark violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And that also applies to George Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims are estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So there is not yet the accusation to be away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was not responsible for the processes at a school where he was not engaged and responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then just back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger consistently disappeared the ears at the intervals?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the splineup which was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "he pointed out this to it," "" "that in the preset continue to be practised in the test." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative statistics, he recommended invariably invading.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was of course at a time when legal clarity existed as a test case had long been banned in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, they occurred in a legal gray area, like everyone of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate, where the persons affected are perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limits had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can also not say he always had taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examination of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis have claimed it be unfair to apply the guidelines for the time today.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we were talking about the "pitfalls of the anachronism," that is to rate the danger of the past moral massacres.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There the princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was broken up in pre-school in opposition and violence to innocent children's rimps, which already goes far beyond that of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite awful and I am glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time Georg Ratzinger must take shelter in protection, because all of this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, i.e. pointers and in the hair and ears to pull, were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical funeral then it was forbidden, he has also kept strictly in it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his Rainsburg time has Georg Ratzinger returned in talks with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the test also come to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI., tells of his perspective, that the Domspatts played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not concede that he caused a stricter Regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionist, without calling for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world trang, true cultural harbours of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and chocolates alone, one does not even make a big singer and before every success, equal to which area but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person you have experienced George Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work at the book and in addition I met Georg Ratzinger really well known and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep believers and savvy good people from which you cannot imagine that he could not do just a fly of a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former Domspatts still get in touch with him today, 23 years after his embargo, regularly visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him to this day, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are today grateful to him that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but yet a lovely respect person was to look at it today and honor them almost.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again quite clear: all that you preset him are guardice methods, which were at the time of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is also prominent and has an even prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just published, relieves it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the analogue would stand, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
