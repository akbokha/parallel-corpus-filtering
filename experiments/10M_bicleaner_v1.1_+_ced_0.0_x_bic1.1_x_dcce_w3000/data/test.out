Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always put in drawers or past@@ ed from outside label , who usually do little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , these things are rather car@@ ving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh that it is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as they are explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan magazine . &quot;
at the dearest the act@@ ress spends her time at home , pre @-@ made television with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ oom and Mexican food , it is in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the whit@@ rod , they bring the question of the child &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is An@@ ist@@ on as a single mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film runs with us from August 25 .
gol@@ fers Lan@@ ger gets the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are manage@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variety with a ride out on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports Pyram@@ id &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses were reminded of their evening , they j@@ ailed in the fast Gal@@ lop to the feed place .
a kilometer at this temp@@ o , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany was best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament c@@ ages - once again close to horses .
he allowed himself to lead himself to his family about the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he sw@@ am not even for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ thilfe handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala , the Gol@@ dene Sport@@ um .
in awards it lacks the sympathetic athlete .
Bundes@@ se@@ duc@@ tors , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already hon@@ ed him .
this is the 18th lau@@ re@@ ate of the sport pyramid .
at Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means me a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger supports the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money from 25,000 euros as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men the two @-@ time master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the excellent include the athle@@ tic Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Fe@@ hren@@ Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ ne Schmit@@ t , der Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ leader Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard .
many of these sports@@ men were on Saturday after Aachen .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative Society mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tru@@ mp@@ s Policy in comparison : IT &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - this is both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential guard are on the tax and energy policy as well as in a key@@ note . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference .
the , on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and warning about how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulatory requirements .
Clinton wants to assert the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
but he himself would be very different , claimed Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely return regul@@ ations and it is strong for long @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the contrary , says : the state has certain duties to fulfil , he has disadvantage opportunities and needs money .
therefore , the taxes would increase for the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
in the words that must be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost iden@@ tically .
the democratic competition announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical tea @-@ wing of the re@@ public@@ ans .
so there may be more internal discussions on Tru@@ mp .
clear are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp wants to build carbon power plants and up@@ lift the coal production in the US again .
oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate change agreement wants to announce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton in contrast will specifically extend the renewable energies with its investment programme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements the two ri@@ vals are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade deal , both do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time both , however , both want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people should then also be better paid , calls for some Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wages .
it wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be , then he says he should not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand there is Tru@@ mp that wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold him before , so that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand Clinton stands at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every dre@@ aded woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who alone can flee , almost to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen are four women .
each has a baby with it , at most a year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one has laid their little son in the arm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked curious with great eyes curious into the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until they notice they are observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
till you speak to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid offers in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are v@@ aded .
in Mün@@ chner north you live in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all@@ ot@@ ted women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs worked together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ chner Women &apos;s Aid .
unfortunately , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
for men there are no - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they become politically secuted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as hop@@ pers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for women there were other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sive , honorary drugs , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , women in refugee camps would often be considered inf@@ erior and worse .
this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in Mün@@ chner north , are trau@@ mati@@ zed , it appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not written voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so habit@@ ual that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust , openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they often do not help them , I need more accommodations only for them , demanding ba@@ thers .
in Bavaria , the seven districts are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether it knew from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction area , some answer with no .
there is no such thing in front of the governments in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken .
even in Schw@@ aben , too , women are not accommodated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some common shel@@ ters or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two key accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study which was published for the Committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacking the privacy , or become men and women together , it can be - constant - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
specially the wash@@ rooms should be separate and easily accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women can feel the most depri@@ ved of this protection , one can by the cr@@ ush it can be found on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been speaking around , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could easily be a second home .
assistance practitioners : demands for new working practices
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member of the assistant have called up their union to approve new working @-@ measures with their disputes in respect of a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called its entire Council to approve more work measures from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that ministers would have failed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assistance and medical students have voted in July through the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members elected to the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC @-@ Ellen @-@ Court said that the government &quot; pers@@ ist@@ ently quiet &apos; had remained to problems what led to the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and asks official re@@ negotiations on all the issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC executive committee has made a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A , to escal@@ ate a running program of escal@@ ating climate policies , which begins in early September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistance practitioners held this year sixty years in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Ass@@ istenz@@ ate Dr. Johann Mal@@ a@@ ana came back to the election of the ref@@ usal of the agreed contract conditions , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during sessions that still occurred before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Public Minister Jeremy Hun@@ t said that the Treaty of Doc@@ tor in England would be put in place .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight months of long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin gets his Turkish counter@@ player in the ild@@ ed hall of St. Peter &apos;s Palace , I cannot rep@@ el the intru@@ der that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most .
there was the envelope , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile had a mal@@ ign@@ ant and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for its back @-@ lasting relationships .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report of all five times .
I could no longer count .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve itself .
the next day it described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so would never be a bit worse .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed more likely to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool showed that the President of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was sore .
Putin shared and accused Ankara , Russia fell in the back .
the understanding was even bigger , since it was committed by a supposed friend .
the c@@ rau@@ ts rebuild again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media introduced a violent attack on Ankara .
it seemed that the Turks seemed to blame for everything .
at the serious test , the accus@@ ations of leadership officers who have benef@@ itted their own family from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has disputed this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the debt forgiveness from the president he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are clear on the hand .
Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends he can get after spending the last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attack on Turkey also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are res@@ umed .
you are counting on a late season of the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television was predicted cheap , fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imported goods are allowed to be allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formed the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry to the West since its reaction to which was trying to take a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the continued res@@ entment will come across the Snow Council &apos;s accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to benefit from the cool mood and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian leader won in Ankara with security to win a bonus that he seeks after a coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for the selected government authorities .
this is well @-@ known for Moscow is a matter of course that even a deepest fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one as it was once described as a analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of foreign lands &quot; : two countries who viol@@ ate from the West and feel badly and now stand up .
nonetheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as the peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after nearly three hours of first talks on the press conference , they said that they had not even stri@@ ped the subject .
the president of Turkey prov@@ ed it deliberately to answer a question about their differences while Putin chose to stress this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potenti@@ als for a perfect Dis@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey decl@@ ining the Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other .
Royal Bank of Scotland can no longer be available for customers outside Scotland
according to the head of the Bank R@@ BS &quot; the R@@ BS &quot; brand is to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the brand R@@ BS had joined the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since eight years ago and had to be res@@ cu@@ ed .
in this time the bran@@ ded &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance marks .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wimbledon champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B are listed , the de@@ centr@@ alised head@@ quarter and the stock exchange at Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for the private customer business , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy since we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue any global goals , but will pursue local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be six Nations sponsor@@ ing no longer and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we focus within ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Board of Directors .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal for three years if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can get these marks again , so I think the time has come .

I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ que when he gets the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction

it has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .

and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has told earlier that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin dam@@ p staff leader Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has released un@@ expect@@ edly his staff of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the nar@@ ro@@ ster of trust by Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , Putin is stating that Putin without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a proxy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diploma .
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his conclusion on the prestigious Staat@@ lichen Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin website ( in Russian ) it says ( in Russian ) that he was later the director and the director of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of legislative and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step has turned Moscow mysterious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest associates of Vladimir Putin and works like he worked for Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as staff leader he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin who was broadcast on television , both men claimed that staff will return to their own request .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a sort of power struggle ?
this is what nobody knows .
but the official claim - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , would once again lead Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , gave me this very complex job - you could almost say - compl@@ ain@@ able post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been president of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov participated the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin former member of the State Security Council K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the federal security service ( F@@ SB ) , who was appointed K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin got to power he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he most trusted .
once it was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term in term , as a third presidential term Putin would viol@@ ate the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , closer ally put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he became president three and a half years later .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion euros project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the North @-@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four sl@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover materials &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the end of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ rope .
the £ 1,@@ 35 bn of the project will be completed by May 2017 .
the Minister of Economics , Keit@@ h Brown had visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the que@@ er of Spain .
we are all witnesses of a volunteer art from a truly epic measure of this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the gap between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the Brü@@ cken@@ deck a tou@@ chy activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge is at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a beta @-@ shot for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
in this fantastic project the sh@@ utter is tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ rise and low @-@ construction .
after installing the last road section and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap in the north or country side .
this was reached by dra@@ gging the bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , about 6,000 tonnes weighs and had to be drawn up at a slope of about 3 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delicate , since the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny -- on each side , they are only a few milli@@ meters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck yet to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of an@@ gl@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in security while moving their boat from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and placed us the worst off , &quot; said the leader of the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds blowing the boat out of their reach until we left water &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and were found at a buck with no li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at .
they all arrived on board the coastal boat boat and were brought back to the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot@@ engine had a p@@ stop@@ ed over a p@@ stop@@ pl@@ one , but these dissolved itself at the cla@@ des of the bot of the person who controlled the boat .
someone came to know today about these men .
heavy hurt - man smo@@ kes up on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to take up his personal things .
instead the non @-@ alcoholic perpetr@@ ated the clothing of his ex @-@ friend .
when this came into the apartment , he stayed twice on them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old has been violated by the hand and the body .
the police could take the cul@@ pr@@ its .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothing of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother .
these al@@ arm@@ ing seem to be one of his sister .
together with their partner the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to soo@@ the their brother .
but she could not move it to the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister went to the side and attacked his ex @-@ friend .
who is building the Braunschweig apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green mean : investors should in future be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to bad news that she will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is lacking so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , in future 20 percent of all apartments must be defined as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock .
but the big issue in the city hall is , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to operate at least 10 percent in such areas but as 20 percent as possible as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing expansion program , which will cost millions and must be financed by incentives , should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors possible as few rules as possible .
the left still wants to be tough for investors .
regardless of it , so Brat@@ mann , a ti@@ ghtening of the situation in the housing market .
if the scope of operation is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
yet the program is not entirely clear : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built in any case .
but how do you feel the loss of some 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose support is going to run in the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments until the year 2020 .
to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the city now .
moreover , it would have to be thought of taking apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the West city .
one stroke can solve the problem .
in the Western city run at the end of the year period .
around 1800 apartments one could get back in the price of transportation for cheap apartments .
only : these are the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the western city was res@@ umed dras@@ tically , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called inter@@ ming@@ ling inter@@ ming@@ ling .
a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must join the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness which is worth
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenagers and child can no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to rigid on screens , has been compl@@ ained in the last decade from many .
with Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and get more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to television , then limited to video games and finally on smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created by a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many phenomena of pop culture the interest in the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand that over@@ threw the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users as ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their smart phones go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are pro@@ secuted with a GPS and once they were found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( over a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; can be captured .
a generation that played the game when she was even younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped in for the search of the sofa .
in the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps which ref@@ utes the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , covering 3@@ 5.000 users , divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed , each day 30 minutes exercising , from 45 percent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data on performance enhancement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to bring people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take about 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ assessed .
those who drives regularly sports is reducing its chances to become ill in cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even join hunting even new friend@@ ships .
as always there are too little cor@@ rupted toys , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should I say ?
it has been a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps were able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fail with time .
because of Pok@@ em@@ ons success there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ations in the real world and helping many people on hunting , active , f@@ itter and healthier .

and now at last the Olympics .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast min@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the multi @-@ camp title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes below the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
its total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the Silver med@@ all@@ ists and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ es@@ amer@@ ad@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ ert@@ ina Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .

Bil@@ es is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American , who wins a multi @-@ fighting title and the fifth , while they soli@@ di@@ fies their call to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her final results was shown and her long journey was in this moment to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es , the last three years have dominated their sport , 15 world cup - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ ad of 1984 Mary Lou Ret@@ ton of her said that she &apos;s &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a last test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between the balance and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a last over@@ dimension@@ ed expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment .
the American @-@ American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ camp of women at the Winter Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es claimed the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party of retirement , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as a break @-@ up .
although it consisted of it , while its long way@@ point insisted on the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their ground exercises - the typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit home at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ ad arena .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school cur@@ sed in the gymn@@ asium , was trained in the bo@@ or@@ man became power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has not lost a multi @-@ contest competition since summer 2013 , which will stop as long as it wishes it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently when they were expecting her En@@ der@@ g@@ ale - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flooded into the bright red , white and blue em@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their check@@ book , to reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medals at a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ old team @-@ she@@ en had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their ground exercise , they cast out to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ ende , b@@ lown away from a com@@ eback , which sometimes appears doubt@@ ful .

police : 3 victims shot in a car when listening to music
according to the police report that were released on Thursday were two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot that killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade ago in the first mass accident of Phoenix while listening to the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was parked in the entrance , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator threw eight shots from a hand @-@ weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is to read in the report .
the police informed that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder will not have been the result of a rob@@ bery @-@ up , since the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of an adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic dwell@@ ings were killed in nine months in nine attacks , and two were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their injury and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness to the police with that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report of the shooting which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck for half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and insured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ mente from the engine .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his retirement , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy did nothing knew .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I won &apos;t manage it .
I don &apos;t manage it .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true - of course , you have left it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her has been told that Ed@@ mund might never realize it under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor bar@@ red up to his third year of age , and he can still not speak .
but it makes slow progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the symbolic language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please look something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him character language at , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented a few characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as at Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds itself of the emotional price of a unt@@ let future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked any more after the prognosis for a long time because I did not expect that someone can truly say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding is given rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
fierce rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to create the shelter . it is calculated the whole Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
numerous rivers in southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Mississippi flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floods to extreme rainf@@ all , reported the national weather service .
the Governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards shared with state officials in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ ity of the Govern@@ ors , shared with the fact that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags are multip@@ lied .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa asked ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ ding system is used over wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed en@@ force@@ able that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall .
in the south of Alabama , a Fl@@ ut@@ ational system was used on Friday , while in the area of Mobile continues to rain .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will be able to reach across the weekend record .
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could be flooded in the subur@@ b near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a stro@@ ve rep@@ lic@@ ated floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , since these are only slowly flowing through the stor@@ my streams .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , finished on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded .
rescue team still sli@@ ppers people from the fl@@ ut@@ water in the district of Am@@ ites and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his boots did find themselves among those who were saved on Friday in the proximity of Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually located more than 400 foot from its house , rises overnight .
he said that he had a further step @-@ of @-@ man who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have awakened and the water flo@@ ated and flo@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , where she had never seen such a rise of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the one who is able to swim .
Hans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ i@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire@@ guard in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated up to Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had rapidly expanded , as there was still serious rainf@@ alls and that the authorities had to consider evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer mel@@ ted near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been se@@ ated considerably since Wednesday since Wednesday .
the authorities gave the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and schol@@ ar in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary of WW@@ L reported that a passenger in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which were now both flooded .
the ruler of the Community Rob@@ by Miller stated that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets that were fl@@ us@@ hed from the flood .
in the towns of Am@@ ites and Ham@@ mond , staff were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ated .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa have been closed almost two d@@ utz@@ ating streets due to high water and sand@@ bags for residents to take care , who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big floo@@ ding that we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Mississippi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses should be reported on Thursday as flooded , but on Friday have not been reported until now .
Keit@@ h Town@@ son , Manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the police agree that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grandparents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grandparents gave that Brown lap@@ ses several foam injuries , including in the lan@@ ging , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in consciousness with his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was sc@@ ant from balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ex@@ z on the broadcast@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I simply cannot believe this .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transm@@ itter that he is expected to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people shot at German@@ town .
likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ olds , which is located in a critical state , was shot , reports the transm@@ itter .
the other two victims did not find themselves in the car and police , whether under one of the injured men of the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to appear to be a cross@@ fire between several guns .
Pat@@ ron@@ age @-@ sle@@ eves for storm @-@ tubes that have been trac@@ ed to different assault ri@@ f@@ les , s@@ wir@@ es the scene .
it seems that this is a clearly @-@ lasting struggle here .
on the road , on both sides of the walking distance , there were sle@@ eves .
so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; shared police officers &quot; Gin@@ al@@ di , police in Philadelphia with the station .
several houses and vehicles were met in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no celebration and the police are currently checking reports , according to the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was taken by a squee@@ ze on the arm when she played in front of her house in the West O@@ ak Lane .
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I am at the front of the Women &apos;s Olympics and that is more than one reason .
first of all , I have been part of the summer olymp@@ ic since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ ew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic li@@ cles , round , makes every pride .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ inside an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ans and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness of the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected , but master@@ ly G@@ ym@@ as@@ tical routines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American , which won in an individual multi @-@ camp event for women gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we do not see gymn@@ as@@ ons throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all sm@@ ote the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four turbines in the team . also , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like Tur@@ nen is a dear@@ er sport and turtles can be maintained primarily in private turn@@ outs which are maintained by parents responsible for training , furnishing , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ers and families ) .
the majority of this turn@@ around lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs to support the business .
in these days , the gymn@@ asts get their whole training and that is a more expensive and long @-@ term engagement .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , coach of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , instructor by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the tower .
we have to be inspired to the con@@ greg@@ ations with countless , young girls , which are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a high @-@ serving and easier access trainers .
I was founded my turn@@ table of 20 years .
during my events we have offered free and affordable k@@ ron@@ es in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , offering the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
turtles develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who are thousands of young girls to care for the tower and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Dutch team of the Olympic team and thank you , F@@ ass will motivate you so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
centers would like to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hun@@ t proposal
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes through acceptance of a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assistant doctors , who voted against a vote , rejected him .
in July , Hun@@ t plans were unvei@@ led to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS was reduced in a &apos; no @-@ country &apos; and any further delay on the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first hospitals are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night @-@ night and weekly contributions to improve the maintenance of different movements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Com@@ bin@@ aries shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ass@@ istance practitioners have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will appeal to the current staff and to treat all doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks that remain still , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running out .
efforts from BM@@ A to solve the dispute through talks with government on reluct@@ ance to take part and sometimes on a de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened one of the talk that Jeremy Hun@@ t had only gone over the last month that his door would ever be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hun@@ t must act now , raise the penetration and address the worries of the assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do this , we have seen the assistant so that they are ready to perform further work schemes .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses were included in doctors in the strike chain .
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better week@@ ti@@ tude for the 5@@ 4,000 assistant who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assistant to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working light measures do not reach much of the only little , but already strain over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare for the patient , nursing staff and their families only worries , hard@@ ship and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the past two months , we talked to the Com@@ bin@@ aries of the assistant and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other ministries in regard to the concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ low@@ ings .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as discharge , flexibility in training , additional training for those who were returning from a vocational training period , training courses and gender equality in medicine - a sign for it were the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug , which can reduce the heart of heart disease
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug since recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period .
the ag@@ ul@@ ting drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for people with a disease infection .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stro@@ kes or another heart attack .
the NE@@ ICE regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS is recommended for a four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the NE@@ ICE regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS is recommended for a four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
approximately 14@@ 0.000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations fatty material in the arteries , the har@@ es form .
when the th@@ ag breaks apart , it can cause a cl@@ ot@@ ting sel that causes blood flow to the heart and thus creates a heart attack .
if the blood pressure is trig@@ gering , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack will be subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the commercial name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the code design of N@@ ICE which today was published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of Aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE Public Health Sciences Research : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all individuals suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable adverse effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attack and stro@@ kes with people who already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information about the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - primarily the blood risk factor - is limited to a period of up to three years . the board design recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t leaves pol@@ ishing in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed from office last year because of corruption from office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t has led to the widespread electoral propaganda in Muslim communities to be ignored by a crus@@ hing government &apos;s report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet of Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks the police , electoral and Rath@@ thouses to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ os and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , which is now a Ant@@ corrupt sk@@ inn@@ ess , said that the intimi@@ dation of voters from religious moti@@ fs were so bad that it should be allowed by the police to build spac@@ ers outside of constitu@@ ent voters outside of constitu@@ ent voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead a identification with him in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present a vot@@ er must simply name its name and address .
the report proposes not to refu@@ te ink at the finger of a person when they give up their election , to prevent someone to choose twice .
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal demands and decisions of non @-@ official com@@ partments or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against electoral fraud , but is also the municipal government in front of the broader corruption and financial culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court decided that the acting Mayor Lut@@ um Rah@@ man after a L@@ itan@@ ei of Cor@@ rupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ secuted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with se@@ gregation and Islam@@ ophobia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rachel is said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation , where one person chooses another one .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence in the whole country of fraud .
he vo@@ iced in particular al@@ arm@@ ing to the frau@@ dul@@ ent envelope - among the older members of the Muslim community made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the feeding of out to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , particularly women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elder , particularly communities with Pakistan or ban@@ ish background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such as such conduct would have ignored such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to Eth@@ ics and Religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition , that political activ@@ ist stamp work to stop &quot; election . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , is also required to prevent hard registration checks to prevent the electoral directory to immigration and welfare purposes .
options are considering to ask voters before the choice of your ID .
do not remove even ink on the finger of a person when she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic checks on the nationality of a person to make sure that they are either justified .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for an automatic envelope .
prohibition that political activ@@ ist for full @-@ election and endor@@ sement of envel@@ ops .
the police give the authority to build spac@@ es@@ hips around electoral stations .
a legislative change that facilit@@ ates an indictment because of intimi@@ dation in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 ( Pop@@ ulation Act 1983 ) .
photography was offered in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in electoral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that employees rule the rule that voters are going to go into the cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets no punishment was taken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court court has Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his deputy for the basis of a L@@ itan@@ ism of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - according to high demands in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the Elec@@ toral Committee of Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the judgment section in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities is threatening this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but the 24 @-@ year Olympic Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only way to have gold fighter athlete who has its own famous double @-@ go@@ ers - at least not if you must believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are running on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ ad showing more than just a certain similarity with Hol@@ ly@@ a famous .
the hunters and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. crew in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o
except K@@ ates doubled in the radar , many people on the internet also pointed out how to be a certain ar@@ chery of the Twin @-@ Pro@@ mi of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the U.S. crew in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures where he looks at the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the madness in social media and said that he has already heard about his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I see no great similarity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I did it as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly move more into the center : the open similarity between the British for@@ ti@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a further prolonged comparison has been pulled between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which shows similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ ning skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan is named Adrian of fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt .

not the only thing : a Twitter @-@ user was very happy about the fact that others have noticed the similarities .
theory placed in the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

another Twitter U@@ ser@@ ene Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .

short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel introduced the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we apologize that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it allows them to be broadcast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday we have quickly apologi@@ zed to our audience on the show and our fo@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media yesterday .
to clarify , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were un@@ reasonable and a miserable chosen formulation . B@@ yron does what he said is very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald apologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his observation by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment for me to apologize for the comment I did after the wom@@ est@@ ran@@ gers in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us turn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark un@@ disturbed via woman , which tried in the middle of the shop under@@ wear under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to see where they should look , when a woman went out their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she insp@@ ected how she looked at it , she pulled off and laid them back into the shelf .
they continue and tasted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Center in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the pants before she put her back into the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she left again and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the shelf space , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the col@@ lage , moved their own whirlpool and pants and try them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a slightly dis@@ crete place to do it - just standing there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every star@@ ing when she res@@ sed the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that her fell down and went out again .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b them that someone watching or about the person who under circumstances would buy the pants , who had tried them . &quot;
MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; as contradic@@ tory to think someone would take shelter with home that had a different person and had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I got along , the employees have tried to draw garments from the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman she had she had her and did not get washed back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident occurring on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone occurred . &quot;
all products in question have been drawn from the sale .

then strike it with the knee into the box and rot@@ ate , while the att@@ acker fights against pain , the weapon from his hands . strike it with the run into the face and move back@@ wards as they set the gun on him .
in att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the lo@@ ader line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate it , so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
shift the weight over the gun at the same time and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then rot@@ ate the gun out of its grip before they move back@@ wards and establish the gun on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is best to over@@ ride your money - unless you are no col@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
Reis@@ ender Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide to his tongue in the most dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ mits its immune system and wor@@ ger@@ ef@@ le@@ x of a serious examination - by doing some of the most dirty and ec@@ tory places in Europe .
the Moder@@ ator and Trav@@ au@@ tor Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sch@@ bled his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a tractor and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of its immune system .
in front of the deriv@@ ative of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to stand and show us on what he is going to do .
but the experiment , which was recorded under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; and brought some surprising results at day@@ light .
the thought , the flush @-@ kno@@ bs of a Zug@@ toi@@ lette blade , which has already been used by thousands of others , may actually be completely rep@@ ell@@ ent , but actually are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria as well as his own health .
fortunately , left nothing , what he wi@@ dened , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to stations to stations to r@@ ins@@ ing toilets , the task set its immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was in any case justified in his reputation .
the only he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his prob@@ ation score showed a L@@ umin@@ ator of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters are fresh for less than 60 .
but there was a Russian res@@ tro@@ om that he refused to fall off after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters had over 4000 units , while freshly caught hand one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number at different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This comes the worst thing I have rolled into a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more mut@@ ation than that !
I will not stop here because it is indo@@ ors here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company stat@@ ated Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intest@@ ine bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os senior vice President for Snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ kov@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explained the benefits of probio@@ tics .
we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which ended with it that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian call . &quot;
they claim that the interest in the gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting manner .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film director , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have tasted my respect for Ian when he had tasted some of the things I have reli@@ ant him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian res@@ tro@@ om shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things where it was easier to put Ian to stop her and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad we have recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents conducted in 2015 including the well being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally use products that contain at least occasionally products attached lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us .
A@@ social family is destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication Social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social @-@ house after a del@@ o@@ ing with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because it had terror@@ ises their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ ch@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were viol@@ ently removed from their property , sho@@ ots of housing corporations found the property in an irre@@ par@@ able condition .
the walls en@@ cla@@ ve holes in wooden di@@ mp@@ s have been rou@@ ded , garbage was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family have been rounded and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the management of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that they were afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property is probably not considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had put the family attached to street struggles with bas@@ eb@@ u@@ d@@ war@@ dly , intimi@@ dated from residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , stretching and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which under circumstances will be demol@@ ished , old trash was found
there were tra@@ ded in the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past nar@@ ro@@ mp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neighbors said that they had to fight them on the street and regularly put the police on a regular basis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ fted her and her partner this week by rap@@ idity of the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to be voluntary .
the del@@ usion were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one thing said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they sli@@ pped around nobody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not accustomed to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had desp@@ ised the family with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house to which the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ riding side of the town@@ house were thrown into garbage and ancient toys .
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and the family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ g@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is taking into consideration .
this was a very difficult case since the behaviour has been extreme and their actions had to be terri@@ bly examined for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have been brave on us and have provided us with the information they have provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate certain neighbours , and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ usion on the ground
workers of domestic administration are now going to be garbage to garbage mountains , which surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid on the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as guards , parap@@ le@@ es and cash at the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skel@@ eton was granted a fine prison , having found guilty of the own@@ ing of a class B in trade pru@@ dence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee skel@@ don was , which came to life in 2013 at a car accident .
after being without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ymouth .
many carp@@ entry of the house were rewarded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police predic@@ ts that they will act ten@@ ant who do not stick to the domestic order
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall shared by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ y was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ breaking as well as those who were damaged by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate a criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to be working with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal displaced after spending a ti@@ ne@@ phe@@ w military jet beach
sun lovers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal made the shock of her life
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane of the ho@@ ist forces made an unbelievable stub@@ ble flight
the air forces handed over that it was on a training flight , but pers@@ isted that no safety risks .
this was the moment , in the scar@@ ed tourists start to fall in panic after a ti@@ at@@ op jet cr@@ ashes over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew close to the sun &apos;s plane on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sp@@ ran@@ ged when they began to worry about the noise of the no@@ zzle without first seeing what came up through the clouds to her .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers , told the videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would fall . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nun@@ o arrogan@@ ce added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down upon me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were translated into panic when the plane came out of darkness and flew immen@@ sely .
the Portuguese aircraft makers today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion flight was on a training flight , to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so that it had to fly deep , that this was the only way to detect them .
the speaker said that the Jet due to the poor visual conditions were flew slightly deeper than usual in the vicinity , while the air forces insisted that safety at no time was at risk .
Fle@@ mish estates have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese festive country , where also four people came to death on the island Madeira .
the Portuguese aircraft adopted today that the pilot had to fly due to the circumstances - strong fog and bran@@ dy - as deep as to fly , which restric@@ ts its vision
the aircraft was on a training flight , where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise

also , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre ter Ste@@ gen is missing .
the German lap@@ se in training a band@@ ing in the knee , with which the demand of Bar@@ ca is at least clear in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen &apos;s tei@@ es in Barcelona has been at the status of the number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique won this until now on a clear decision and led Bra@@ vo to the League , but T@@ er ste@@ gen in most of the remaining applicants .
before the first mandatory game of the new game , there is doubt about the fitness state of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at the 3 : 2 in the trial of S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday did Li@@ on@@ el Me@@ i and Co. is not really convincing .

Barcelona has previously released eleven successes in this review .
Ma Long in his own League to table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - the Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic stadium .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a unilater@@ al finale , &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.@@ 4 ) .
with this , the World Ran@@ kings @-@ First the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam , &quot; winning the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ als @-@ Fin@@ als , and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected into end@@ game and made the title with each other .
so it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would be able to fetch the single title in the signs of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the top @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ n@@ ö @-@ allo@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no cover .
they withdrawn on the grand@@ stand and left their s@@ acks in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches until here I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang was rightly said .
following the game @-@ positive gold and silver med@@ all@@ ists with the China Flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly sided .
Ma had really fighting with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
then he set the pace on the record and left there only a total of 13 points .
the superiority of Ma was not developing the expected match .
but nevertheless there were plenty of breath @-@ taking Ball@@ on .
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year W@@ ager Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
the White Russians had turned himself in his quarter @-@ finals against the German European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , a ri@@ b @-@ breaking treatment , was then in a doctor &apos;s treatment , &quot; ultimately had to be beg@@ ged with metal .

Donald Tru@@ mp Sp@@ t ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states to acc@@ ede their majority .
President Donald Tru@@ mp was now calling for weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of Utah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gau@@ ge Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported .
after he threw 16 ri@@ vals within the separate Republi@@ can camp from the race , now the doubt grow in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before protest@@ ant Christians , which he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt are false reports on his candidates , he took again his well @-@ known media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can skyscrapers
Utah is usually a safe bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
in a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , Tru@@ mp and his bankruptcy of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ ated .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by far the distance that can be used for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
as endangered also in Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC answered Tru@@ mp on the question , how he wants to stop the rise of Clin@@ ics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I did so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether back , I will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything other than &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
if it does not end for him at the end of the political correctness , it is fine , said Tru@@ mp further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the press report , the Party of Tru@@ mp is intended to pro@@ secu@@ te funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey .
instead of doing the re@@ public@@ ans of the re@@ public@@ ans for the Congress you want to get stronger under the arms .
Olympia : Dre@@ ister fraud on d@@ oping test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipline of discipline .
Ken@@ ias Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tes threatened after the second d@@ oping affair during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a bed test for a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee shared with you to immediately establish a disciplinary Commission , in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village have given a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ ul@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was the Team@@ work of Kenya reported by the d@@ oping Contro@@ llers .
the IO@@ C IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to do its own investigations , a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make a rating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it in a IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and has been issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , the rehearsal and wrote , &quot; stated Kenya &apos;s Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I .
he was in the possession of the ac@@ creditation of athletes , who stood on the list for training checks in the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan &apos;s athle@@ tics Head of Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio @-@ Play .
he is supposed to be informed of cash payments of his country via pending d@@ oping tests .
media reports say he was arrested in his return at the Nairobi airport .
in the IO@@ C of IO@@ C , Kenya is a special observation of the IO@@ C for a longer period of time .
in the announcement of the IO@@ C written more than 2000 d@@ oping target controls before the Rio Games , it is imperative that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world @-@ anti @-@ D@@ oping agency in Brazil had a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics commen@@ ced .
subsequently , W@@ ada Kenya took advantage of the list of countries whose d@@ oping fighting is con@@ stric@@ ted with the rules of the W@@ ada .
Kenya is regarded as a large runner @-@ nation .
the loan of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports the ARD has always been re@@ charged , that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of beer fraud .
IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had put it in Russian athle@@ tics .
thereby it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type and systematically ge@@ d@@ opt was performed .
Russian athle@@ tics le@@ tes were excluded from the summer of the summer .
Salzburger Land West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ ney &apos;s Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of Klassi@@ k and filled with the role of Mary a nightmare .
in the orchestra m@@ elt the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuel@@ an Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ dered Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; war@@ med up .
we are always saying that they are very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have music in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older bran@@ dy Mary .
she is reminded of melanchol@@ y on her dar@@ ing with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there was Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says it in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel , oh so , I feel , and wit@@ ty and b@@ right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character , whom I have as Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of worship for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an extremely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
Re@@ vised is for him a necessity .
one sees it in any of its movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , this is very important !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have passed the refugees , then the Puer@@ t@@ ori@@ ans went to New York and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same issues and they are as expres@@ sive as they are at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

SU@@ L@@ TA@@ NA was 17 years old and died according to her family , shortly after she had imagined to leave the war @-@ exploited country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved to go into a war area - to prevent people from making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 SU@@ L@@ TA@@ NA and two other school girls from the east of London reached a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as family has been told that she married a ISIS &apos; fighter in Syria - and it became a widow within a few months .

the Kurdish municipality of Germany counts on short notice to ten thousand @-@ seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
in the medium @-@ term , there could be even &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; the Verb@@ al Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the harsh alleg@@ ation of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , after the coup , the Kurdish community on Germany expects a mass evasion to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with ten thousand @-@ term seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdogan regime fought against minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CEO Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government already took over several months ago with pris@@ ons , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run .
after the van@@ ished put@@ sch , there are still se@@ cular and opposition ethnic Turks .
many are going to start anew in Europe if they are going to be re@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees to take refugees in their own country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Association announced the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tical cities .
so that Erdogan would like to increase the travel pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been ex@@ terminated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader called for the German government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp@@ ly as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hex@@ en@@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdogan &apos;s critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len @-@ Movement also feared the escape of many Turks .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the Brand@@ mark@@ ung as hall@@ ways tra@@ ilers were destroyed teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and Erdogan is lying , sitting on gri@@ pped bags , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reported on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry , the Turks presented the biggest group of the asylum entitled asylum in Germany because of political persecution in asylum .
as of 30 June , this is 11.@@ 3@@ 50,000 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all treated as equal rights ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is not a question of war , poverty or fu@@ el@@ essness .
asylum in accordance with the Basic Law , are exclusively politically , therefore from state side , individually comp@@ lied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
funny Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : locals get nothing of the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia may not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for bl@@ ending than so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and landing stage - this bites .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation .
the most vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so are not allowed to choose the land@@ lady .
to do this , practical problems : during the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters impose , air balloon , fl@@ yers , and end the end voices , only fatigue @-@ filled .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to be passed over by the people over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting will cut how strong new@@ bie fr@@ y cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ zable dust .
cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 leader , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign .
he travels across the land , distributed ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as it is already his legendary wor@@ t@@ kar@@ ger &apos;s predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , counsel@@ ing got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel to blame for the b@@ los@@ som@@ ing of the African . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your refugee policy , you &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably cost him the nice office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with their peak data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it &apos;s when you make the wrong time at the right place election campaign .
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to mi@@ tig@@ ations ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag faction is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it was too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U disp@@ arities mostly on the usual electoral campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , so says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also indicated that in the country you need to br@@ ate the base that they must very strict , find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Green : in the borders of the country hardly exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ elections Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to go where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot stands on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed electoral campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats finally lay with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only shortly before the A@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had yet become clear with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small @-@ party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should lead the leap into the agricultural day .
they make a modern virtue from the holidays and reloc@@ ate their electoral campaigns into the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is called the Chairman of the Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green election campaign on par@@ ur@@ ing search for indigenous stimul@@ ants among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the chief can@@ did@@ acy , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the mec@@ kl@@ bur@@ ial lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : gast@@ ro@@ wers suffering from block@@ age
at the speed of speed , with which the B 27 will find , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8 pm , there is a lot of praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made all pretty z@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be moved on the weekend to mid @-@ time as scheduled to south until the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ wor@@ e will also be praised for those responsible for construction work , for example when it comes to setting up accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to the south has moved and the block of the asp@@ ire road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back again , the traffic situation in the village has relaxed .
citizens can now return from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the export traffic through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief executive director Florian King , responsible for the transport @-@ technical management of the rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Wag@@ er@@ straße , Stein@@ laugh@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because a lot of cre@@ eping paths sought and rather mar@@ ching their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks in living areas fell fran@@ ked .
as the velocity limits were not observed , the community also called on the measuring instrument from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable over@@ steps , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself about the situation on site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute has been fle@@ ed .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 kilometers per hour at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has been moved , but it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort , that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
business@@ men do not like to have a look at the cards .
however , that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation with them has led to sales subsidiaries , everyone that one asks , have to look through .
however , some more and some are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus produced for other companies , for whom there is hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; no more slight decline , &quot; but also that of course , &quot; the balance sheet is missing . &quot;
the most exploited are the Local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all the hosts have made it &quot; hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers of He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be pleased with every Euro turnover .
on &quot; 50 percent &quot; sales performances , he has risen to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road @-@ drawing took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff have to have released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismis@@ sed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there would be a financial compensation , the hospitality prof@@ iting otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B . now it also required the disadvantages to carry out through the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where a little room@@ y was handled .
with all law@@ suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his guest will continue to exist .
finally , the family business has been moved here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history of history .
that other regul@@ ars are less often subject to change due to complicated traffic control , he can understand .
if you can not drive , it is also somewhere nice .
that his regular climate change back to the end of the re@@ organisation work again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it .
despite the crises with BS@@ E and bird @-@ flu , G@@ öh@@ ner thinks the effects of the B 27 @-@ building on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
constantly being rob@@ bed in the name of the terrorist fight in laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what does a D@@ ul@@ um status do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ er say about all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is the Re@@ conci@@ liation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all its proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister in the presentation of his new security packages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are calling no one .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participate in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a Interior , he was close to his results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for@@ ni@@ ble consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach presented a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security of the Republic .
but these are even more the more extensive .
some have already been known , announced , announced : that a new security authority is to take care of the cel@@ estial communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU directives to aviation data and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising .
partly , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , a second attempt on proposals which have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to dism@@ iss sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups under punishment and killed the jihadists with double citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still do this for reasonable and demanding too , what I have no opportunities at co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ers anyway .
a few new ideas presented in Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
these are partly in itself : he plans to push for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for de@@ tain@@ ement of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted into the country should first leave their smartphone and disclose social @-@ media accounts for a safety check .
at D@@ ul@@ ls for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - about such crimes alleged to commit crimes or their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them is political and legal .
man@@ ches also acts un@@ bi@@ ased and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the unequal treatment of thought , for example - raises the question : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it is not easy to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
furthermore , many people were worried about the high refugee numbers about safety .
and things that are deeply occupied by men were not cl@@ inging to election times even in election times .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election fights .
the Union and the SPD are thus growing increasingly in position with the issue of internal security .
in the past few days between the two parties were high .
only a gar@@ dener dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Minister , in which the Ress@@ orts are also a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also here a conc@@ il@@ able tones .
from a return from the double pass he kept nothing .
we have fri@@ ghtened the discussion in Germany .
you re@@ make new , be not useful .
and he has constitutional concerns with a Bur@@ ka ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ ent to all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the co @-@ operation partner , it only has to show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are some things in which things could worry about .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ filed with the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled first time careful talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to improving safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still Volkswagen glimp@@ ses through .
despite diesel sk@@ and@@ als , the supply numbers are rising worldwide .
but it is not possible in all markets .
in the recall campaign there is a term for a term .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest car@@ makers can offer a plus further up to a plus due to its many brands and some well @-@ operating markets , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ known markets .
but in July the core brand , VW brand in particular in Western Europe and bur@@ dened with it again the overall sale , as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW brand sold the brand VW in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , the sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ened the deliveries to almost a sixth of sixth year .
bran@@ dy of Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , I have given a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote have also deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the g@@ asi@@ tism first escal@@ ated first , is also further a minus to be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected household mark of Lower Saxony is already farther across the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an ex@@ tradition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is at EUR 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
consolidated sales of Fred Kap@@ makers from January to July moved to a sales network from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this time worldwide , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software subscription tests .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles to re@@ armament in the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the reconstruction of the cars has no negative effects .
after the re@@ armament of vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
the car@@ bure@@ au present the customer after re@@ armament a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certification , &quot; but it does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel .
cause for law ab@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported Volkswagen grants a guarantee of its German customers now but a guarantee for improved diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on last Monday VW representatives in the Federal State Department .
out of the traffic Ministry has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has the requirements of my investig@@ ative committee and the KBA full of full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the re@@ armament no dis@@ agreements are held and all the type @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it meant in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provides Volkswagen for example a year after re@@ armament approximately with an engine damage to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the customer interests , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which at all have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal if it comes to providing uncertainty with regard to possible claims , as it meant .
because of this , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity measures in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
banking propriet@@ or Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it is only about 139 customers , who want to park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ cash accounts . &quot;
the German Association of German banks talks about an isolated case and does not see a signal : normal savings should not be afraid to pay for their austerity sanctions . &quot;
bearings banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties .
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September to private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or cash payment accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul .
he has existed for quite some time 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he cannot fail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those lie with me in the central bank account and cause 0.2 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the banker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost will give it on to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to leave the cash at the saf@@ es of the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four incidents , I do not like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Ban@@ ker .
most customers would have understanding and rarely seen on other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operation of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commercially viable not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
with pris@@ als for deposits as of three million Euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger country had made head@@ lines with their sk@@ ate bank branch 2014 head@@ lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive director of the banking Association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect to pay private clients to cover savings for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong in Germany and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ kers said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el , which is equipped of property a little lush . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank if they are free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooperative co @-@ founded C@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region there are known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operation of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently no further banks are known , which calculate an investment approach for deposits of individuals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der German Pop@@ ular banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had finished in late June : &quot; the threshold , the neg@@ atives to go towards private clients , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition was tough and it thre@@ aten the migration of leg@@ ms to competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers in Germany will not be fallen in width .
destination plates : who is buying records ?
lonely men middle aged love records .
before you take the comment to comment on it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ men &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multi@@ dimensional reconstruction of Schall@@ platten is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are of all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time to spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy road in Soho , a modest tur@@ key , and wild , before I ste@@ al , my hands hold and somewhat blur@@ b like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart doesn &apos;t eat slowly in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling out the buildings where independent sellers are located - there are still a handful of fantastic plate specialist stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera to the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and temper@@ ament .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men aged men ) into the Rec@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages ) , a woman , probably around the 20 ) is a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records .
this LP , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I am not sent to it home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why it has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as they appeared and once again buy objects which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70@@ ies which was published when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend your own time , and adds : &quot; I smo@@ kes not and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , it has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and set up to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have led , people usually have reli@@ eved of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to get back to their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to followers of the plate grounds of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers participated in the contact @-@ contact payment system .
some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted Schall@@ pl@@ atten@@ ds , from objects , the happy jewel@@ s .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be a filling of a void or the possession of material possessions , as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the collectors I think so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to be mentally engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ atten@@ ds a staff of a turn@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet been listened to .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not have a record player .
at this time of the message I would probably look very worried , while I turned aside through a stack of mali@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle ages ) has worked , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radio head record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a large percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ ous .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come until slowly .
f@@ overnight , which has devoted to the sound panels almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go out .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women aged aged .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts new thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ c@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz blend from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers .
none of them sees son@@ o@@ ily enough , but wet mental trau@@ mas are hard to set if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around for a few minutes and looked at the variation of the plates for sale .
it rather makes a sho@@ ck@@ pe@@ e as a large one .
it does not deserve much , hence the gathering of plates isn &apos;t real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a loved si@@ gh off .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it truly is unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record owners : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
as I give the semb@@ lance to mu@@ red je@@ ans hot@@ spots , I watch a group of young teenagers , group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a stair@@ well , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees her - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some as far as it is impossible to grasp them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could make more money for the industry and could send some customers in the depths of so@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they do , at least in record stores in Soho , the large number of female gather@@ ers and records who exist in reality , record stores and in online for@@ en .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
you will spend their Thursday tomorrow with security not by bike rides from Ber@@ wick Street and leaves through sheets , while watching the rigid eye of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year false moder@@ ator , who climb@@ s over the shoulders of nothing of the men &apos;s middle age .

French Court re@@ jects offers of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected a quotation of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais in which thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the State should be authorized to sell 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp merchandise , sell from cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be crus@@ hed because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and that bergen a fire@@ - and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the dish that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals offered by the public supported Association and other groups are not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they carried out the fact that Pro@@ visional businesses and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for expulsion of people who run 72 provisional shops , but adm@@ its that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are absolutely comprehensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feed people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is shared , and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum seekers for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it meant that the closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the recent eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two auxiliary organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants ins@@ criptions on Friday that the number of people in the jun@@ k Living was increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise in new arri@@ vals in the course of the summer .
despite Olympia disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ arily
despite its disappointing appearance at the olymp@@ ic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin will not want to be underestimated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep on keep the World Cup at a glance , keep up confident and struggles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have a statement for his mis@@ able twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; to me it is honestly hard to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin .
he must analyze in peace and would have led the reasons for the de@@ acon .
Martin actually wanted to join the title at the time F@@ ahr World Cup in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything exactly what we have changed at the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s sha@@ kers have to adjust to the next generation of speed control : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the temp@@ o to be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic @-@ effective en@@ closure of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , can be used in random points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by police .
for example , on highway construction or to rolling bridges with temporary pol@@ ishing , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary aper@@ ture for the observ@@ ance of speed bumps .
a long @-@ lasting mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : his battery stays with un@@ interrupted measuring operation five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology can also cover all vehicles across multiple tracks across the same time .
variable velocity limits and flow message after time , chassis and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ driven state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with a pend@@ ant cl@@ utch .
in order that he is not simply cl@@ oned , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the car@@ vers from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and meanwhile also used .
also foreign authorities bl@@ acks with the new technique : rejuven@@ ated France 100 pieces of Georgian , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ vic stage .
Fiji has given a master class in handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , retro@@ spect , line run and crude strength to win gold - its first olymp@@ ic wa@@ ist of any color .
the defeat was captured by the not too bad Tro@@ st@@ Prize from the silver medal - Great Britain fourth on this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the sharp defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back to it in the finals .
but regardless of each other , Fiji on this form would have been beaten a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be for UK a con@@ sol@@ ation - but will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite will have a gold medal at his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Che@@ f@@ coach Ben Ryan , the former chief for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan of each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here , they lost just one .
this s@@ cap is going to do , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderful , leaving the attacks of GB@@ s out of fun Ab@@ pl@@ allen .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co . on , as if one would run in travel buses . the World Series @-@ winner went to 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wai still added another attack from the right corner , which he changed .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely installed the ball .
a hot ti@@ sti@@ cal tick from Mitch@@ ell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal : but it has encountered Fiji only .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right turn is a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for UK .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the rec@@ ti@@ ff and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ cri@@ es through further weak T@@ abl@@ ings of the GB team and run down to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought an 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while Britain still continues to read .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ del@@ ian gap ... for quite four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , to Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started making an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running long in favor of southern overseas sul@@ ph@@ ans , whose fans s@@ add@@ ling and danced at the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ icing on a further trial in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff cat@@ ered , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked off in the tur@@ f .
earlier in the day , Fiji in Japan in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeats and the UK forced South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the boat in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored one gate below the post in the second half .
a brilliant late T@@ ackl@@ ing of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside teams , secured the gain - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing .
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold than in these games , and that is what they want .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who enter the story , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment on the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the conf@@ ers who were sitting at the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was omni@@ present than her to the second Olympic @-@ old in two without tax @-@ wife in a row , the first women in the history of British sports that placed such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9,@@ ter un@@ wel@@ ded use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athlete who gli@@ de on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflecting the kind of trig@@ gering .
behind each gold in the Ru@@ ins , a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers contribute to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and it was no one assistant than the coach who would not even survive this day at all when diagnosed with him cancer .
as he said , he is risky .
I had bl@@ isters , the oper@@ able and that did them .
if you do not , it spreads throughout .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little to the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could begin to keep the break down to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go back soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the inv@@ inci@@ bility of victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a nerve rac@@ er morning so doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning which was as Haupt@@ mann at the Royal Ar@@ till@@ ery Regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that might be something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much me this means , how much I and Helen and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I could not have a better person to carry out or wish a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark signed , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped at the moment .
Helen called &quot; St@@ ay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to make some Tol@@ les .
we did not want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions on its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to grasp that I am a Olympics .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years exemplary for clarity
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose group , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ widely exemplary . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association is a model for the big water producers .
this was the name of some time ago in the origin@@ ator at the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
a little later the water@@ forum of the Government of Lower @-@ linked the two @-@ union feder@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ i @-@ group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is widely regarded as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the second @-@ association staff , of which 28 years as managing director .
he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ er@@ group with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , supports approximately 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 locations and past@@ ors with about 5@@ 500 residents .
member communities are the churches of Kirch@@ berg , Broad@@ brunn , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further cities and communities there is water supply agreements .
the current chairman , lati@@ tude of the master@@ y of Ger@@ tru@@ d stages ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller 1985 was set as water wart and was appointed as General Manager of the two @-@ state association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water management and maintenance activities , bud@@ ding jobs , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency procedures at weekends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restructuring of the high vessels ( 1999 ) , the new creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the divi@@ ding of water lines .
there was no down@@ st@@ agnation and one always received any new features because water lives and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o they praised idols , loyal and accurate service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose and he has lived for the water@@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing group to the nit@@ rate group before the district forum of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he received so much recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ on the one hand praised B@@ f@@ ons Grie@@ bel , who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best water bath , and he was a faithful cr@@ acking .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as highlights from his point of view he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the two @-@ state .
the biggest challenge and the hard@@ est use were but the pel@@ ican on the flood in the church lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn did not even be able to maintain , because one filled the container container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with h@@ oses .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who res@@ igns the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is openly talking to the au@@ ti@@ stic of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other interested parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to have the courage to speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ year of the Italian newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corri@@ ere della Ser@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the now eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now learn private in New York where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something about what two years ago , when I sang at the Milan , he reminds himself of nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ s - man sho@@ ots on a partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot at an apartment house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ s ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday and will be injured on his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called and indicated his life @-@ partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a poli@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , according to him will be publicly f@@ ished .
meanwhile , because Sven S. could be traveling by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a lat@@ ch .
meanwhile the police has released a photo of it .
it is however a few years old .
in the meantime , the man carries a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon in himself , so the police .
who Sven S. looks , will call the 110 call .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim is year 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck first did not want to make any statements relating to the Ta@@ ther@@ course or the relationship between the perpetr@@ ator and the victims ; but she confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently not saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police company in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - lighting for German steel industry
the cr@@ atic @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in million@@ aires .
financial bur@@ dens that are threatened with the industry from the oil , are out of the table .
it abi@@ des for exemp@@ tion from the Renewable energy donation in the component to the so @-@ called self @-@ production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( C@@ WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that after two years we could finally reach tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel manufacturer , the gases from the ho@@ stages to generate electricity for their own consumption , at the checkout process .
according to the German industry , the steel industry remains an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros a year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , I now give a key@@ note with the EU Commission for talks with competition Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators used to be replaced in the steel works , all an E@@ EG re@@ position is 20 percent .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission to produce their own production .
in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be established .
special meaning have the successful effort from Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is this a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission level , climate and employment objectives are considering &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said IG Metall Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel sector in Europe has been suffering from excessive capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a significant price pressure .
last year more exac@@ erb@@ ated the situation as the world &apos;s biggest er@@ land China threw China in view of the weak@@ ening local demand of mass@@ ag@@ ingly steel on the world market .
European manufacturer raise Chinese steel @-@ counter prize @-@ dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation has relaxed .

community , mind , health : singing is doing very good
the singing has been with UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as young girl she was at school choir , in teacher studies , she took the F@@ ach music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a sample they feel balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says .
in doing so , she does something good with her health and mind .
because S@@ ingen is right from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most of the seniors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describe H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , seniors can establish social contacts and cultivate them .
because often social and family structures in old age solve a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense means H@@ ac@@ kler .
for they are practicing seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly call his lungs regularly , they are not so quick in everyday life as quickly as the dolls .
even if it comes to getting the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the federal work community of the senior organizations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure .
L@@ enz is often observed that singing or hearing of songs by elderly people gets a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and particularly melodies , themselves den@@ sely den@@ sely den@@ sely den@@ sely den@@ sely populated events .
in singing the head is also required to have a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone so do not just concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you experience through the singing in the choir means H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem is growing by the singing in the choir .
to show himself : if I am long for something , I will get better and alert about myself - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , betra@@ ying L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 Sing@@ ing people who list@@ ens out when a sound is next to it ?
in search of the suitable offer , seniors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sings someone out of the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior or@@ ench@@ y@@ or , you can simply join .
many cities also offer insights about choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir can turn directly to church or church officials .
many seniors can also be found via the Internet .
those who have no access to the internet may ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the inter@@ ne@@ cher@@ che .
those who desire has to sing , should absolutely join a choir , betra@@ ys H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is doing the soul well and has something fre@@ er - that applies to any age .
cats react sensitive as a han@@ go@@ ver on scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the Ru@@ gs of kittens has grown up to adult animals .
to her surprise , the ch@@ ew also didn &apos;t let the males go cold - but they kept unlike the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the pron@@ unciation of kittens by the little ones of the little ones .
they are responding to ten percent faster on foli@@ age of kittens that are in great need to find out how scientists from the veterinary University and the Medizin@@ ische Hochschule Hannover ( MH@@ H ) found out .
han@@ go@@ ver also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ch@@ ew of less and severely worn out for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the plans in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
she is the first authorit@@ ative study published on this Friday in &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kittens moved with the urgency of their assistance in need .
a total of nine adult male and eight females were observed from the veterin@@ arian of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a piece of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated by both mother and si@@ blings .
on the other , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger kittens that were additionally taken up .
the researchers consider their results in spite of the tiny sample of the sample .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who have not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they rot@@ ated faster to the loud@@ speaker , when this Ru@@ fe played the very well @-@ controlled kittens .
this ability may be innate or develop@@ ped up with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of women and men in c@@ ots .
also , some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants re@@ acted , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the company &apos;s plans reported in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ran@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey there was an arrest warran@@ t against the one @-@ silent football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey there is another important football game .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between Col@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as &quot; is announced .
already in the suspension of an emergency , after the overthrow trial in July , the government , the daily routine of norm@@ al sol@@ ace should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected the motion of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len that is responsible for the coup attempt .
no content is made in front of the football team .
against the former St@@ ark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ran@@ r , the Pro@@ secutor had an arrest warran@@ t .
according to this , the mar@@ qu@@ ad living in America is now being accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ran@@ r should be adher@@ ents to the crying Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len that will be held responsible by the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt .
although initially for 90 days of exceptional circumstances applies until October , in fact it did not affect the life of the most Turks but as good as no impact .
the night@@ time democracy guard &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - split in trailer and opponents .
especially fans of the club si@@ lica are traditionally not counted among the friends of the President .
what the Gro@@ s of the Turks but considering dram@@ ati@@ cal experiences in the history comple@@ xi@@ on , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even though the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or colon@@ t@@ as .
at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will arrive very again to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the previous season as proof : with 17 gates and nine templates , in all competitors , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as a top@@ scor@@ er of his club .
in the end game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he posted the 1 : 0 @-@ winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team to tro@@ phy .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the disap@@ point season for the record Master found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion .
after the round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also appear early in the Europe League .
in the South with Li@@ g it reached only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Col@@ kt@@ as , the year was better .
first of all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , which laid with 26 seasonal numbers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ scor@@ en@@ kö@@ nig as the basis of the 14th title .
this is also the reason that fans hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the Gom@@ ez stood in the Treaty of Florence by the Treaty of Florence , after the coup attempt to go back after the coup , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; noted the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to do this , the falls should be ready to refrain from around a third of its worth 7.5 million euros valued at 7.5 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes have many medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Justin Gat@@ lin was locked twice because of dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others translated ly@@ m@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics @-@ sinners can only laugh - they fight in Rio to medals .
the topic d@@ oping still determines the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer@@ es in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , which had interven@@ ed after a d@@ oping lock , just before the games , was gn@@ omy at her start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ c@@ il@@ essly and dis@@ bu@@ ed .
it offered itself a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenario : with a superior smile she was still proud of the hall and prov@@ oked with her performance .
being certain that she won &apos;t be gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ubil@@ ation tower .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite d@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m / Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
it was closed for two times because of dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion becomes even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the greatest re@@ vocation of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m / Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and si@@ fold world cup had to sit in 2010 a six month lock , after taking the intake of the pain using ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympi@@ ad of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 have been positive on the bot@@ tled stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic bu@@ ked the wis@@ s intake and was locked six months .
the four fur@@ row thro@@ ws this year will go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ors .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic stadium and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , 2010 was well tested and 21 months have been blocked .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , di@@ abo@@ ed Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the far fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athlete have been detrimental to so many medals .
so lost Ti@@ ch@@ on his WC title from 2005 nine years later after he was detected with testosterone d@@ oping .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games 2008 received it due to a judgment of the International Sports Court .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he sits in position two of the world rankings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the World Cup and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but it must still start in Rio .
in the 29 year old world championship in evidence were found on the intake of a bot@@ tled dietary supplement , the Sper@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency W@@ ada dropped off and ran already on July 13th .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Sever@@ al T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early .
they have f@@ aded away and treated in the hospital , but I have already left this once more .
her home@@ coming I planned her for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe , are also severely affected by Austrian citizens .
the State Department also stand in close contact with the local authorities , so buck@@ le .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok @-@ located Hua H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a walk @-@ out of two bombs .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ change were killed and about 20 people have been injured , including the Austrian people , three Germans , three defeats and three Italians .
Friday early then two spr@@ eng@@ ages went high , and according to the authorities another human being was killed .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb blast .
during the detection near the near of holiday@@ makers popular Bad@@ est@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country explo@@ ded a further bomb that killed a city @-@ set .
the spr@@ ite is according to the authorities in a flo@@ wer@@ et in front of the territory of the coastal police in the air .
finally , de@@ port@@ ations were called in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ phe on the southeast coast several Ver@@ last .
from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attack carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai Rau@@ meth@@ av@@ ee as early as journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may be too early to express yourself to possible motiv@@ ations - probably though it is the works of Muslim rebels .
even Thai media wanted to recognize a sample in the attacks that is typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the contrary , the Thai police declared , the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , which is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
over the past few days , the authorities would have received secret indications to im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places .
yet , be unclear what group is behind the attacks .
the police dismis@@ sed its officials around the country to enhance security around important government buildings and airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment .
in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attack , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over many years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the talks bombar@@ d@@ ment , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends up to his homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities as a result .
high safety risks ( security level 3 ) stayed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ano and Sur@@ round@@ ing Area .
according to disputes between security and Muslim populations , there will be no longer necessary journeys in these provinces .
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) pay for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday passed a few days after a controversial referendum on one out of the military jun@@ ta .
this adm@@ its the military influence over the coming years as well .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs would have been an attempt to p@@ ect chaos , while the country moved towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 following a phase of bloody distur@@ ban@@ ces , holds itself good to have led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on for years in the extreme south of the country &apos;s revol@@ ving uprising .
more than 6,@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago in Bangkok had been killed in a stop at a popular Hind@@ u @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody bomb of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the sight of the federal government for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several provincial offices also the constitutional environ@@ ment@@ alists have provided the group under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Identi@@ t@@ arian motion &apos; points for aspirations against the free democratic constitution , &quot; said Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin .
in this way the emig@@ rants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in a extrem@@ ist way .
therefore , we are watching the movement well .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it applies against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ ticul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional Ar@@ cher in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , N@@ RW , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; identity &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the offices in the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extremis@@ ts trying to speak with the young righteous language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists , as well as right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts .
this is not true advertising for your own cause .
propaganda should respond to people emotional .
young people are suscep@@ tible to in a special way .
this is dangerous .
finally , there have been reports of the contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to African politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have a knowledge .
for the constitutional protection possible contacts of this species can only be relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the African - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their target device and are so extrem@@ ist .
decisive is that such persons have been contro@@ ll@@ able influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the marked increase in human rights violations and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ ate did eat , he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have found in the past few years that there can be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the free group .
it can be quite sure that further non @-@ terrorism group@@ ings or small groups constitute the attack against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attack from other extreme @-@ right motiv@@ ations .
but a German @-@ wide or pan @-@ European control of legal cabinets is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
concerned , Ma@@ ate did eat that lots of gri@@ ps on the account of people entered , which did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the worrying .
many of the Tat@@ ry susp@@ ects on Asyl@@ um arri@@ vals were not known as criminals , politically motivated accused or adher@@ ents of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences that previously had no right on the hat , which perhaps were politically in@@ different , or for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left who voted for themselves through right @-@ right mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is becoming inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympics or world cor@@ ds the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center spon@@ ge the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it disappeared simply - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transferred to the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a back @-@ up of 48 seconds ended its predecessors and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure that attracted attention of international media attention .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special launch by the international swimming @-@ association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ represented countries known .
as in A@@ e@@ dic@@ s the most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly made the first nickname of the first round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media be@@ amed it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ ue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Fre@@ isti@@ l , has not played a role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from the Equ@@ atorial Guinea @-@ Guinea as he had to compete in a subur@@ ban over 100 meters Fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically was f@@ aded M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
at that time 22 @-@ year @-@ old , I learned about eight months before Olympia and had never done such a long distance before the competition .

in post @-@ own production , the company plan the construction of up to 10,000 cars a year and tier .
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars in the long run and make a complete conversion to the environmentally friendly vehicles over the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had said the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ FR@@ P guide appears to disap@@ point business numbers
the consumer @-@ research company Gf@@ K sw@@ aps his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the backs were suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the Gf@@ K &apos;s market research scientist allowed that the chair of Executive Director Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes all the more uncertain , the longer the successes they promised .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nürn@@ berger Market Research @-@ Division Gf@@ K : after again disap@@ point business numbers and the res@@ ignation of the company leadership is the worldwide number five of the industry before a personalized new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P &apos;s Executive Board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no grinding , with effect from September 12 from the Supervisory Board .
the management of the Executive Board already ski@@ pped the previous executive board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , shared the company .
he is officially supposed to take over the function of a &quot; CEO , &quot; until a successor was found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the call@@ ings , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differing views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a company speaker on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if in future the market research agency will be le@@ ite , is currently not yet unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ feld it was on Friday , during the shareholders , the disappointment at the continued success of the restructuring had been great over the continued success of years ago .
Mr Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K @-@ top since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruit of restructuring is not yet to be seen after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the last bad Gf@@ K business numbers , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this would be the case at BMW , it would also make the quot@@ as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company had not able to stop its losses in the preceding quarters , even in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.@@ 1 percent below the level of the previous year @-@ year comparison .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales of EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million rose by 3.4 per cent .
earnings in the second quarter , above all , has poll@@ uted value of the company in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the company &apos;s activities required in the Consumer Experience Off@@ ices of 139 million euros have been owned by the Group under the St@@ rich , a loss of 14@@ 8,@@ 2 million euros .

accidents - Bus slip in cr@@ abs in dit@@ ch : eight Ver@@ last
during an accident of a travel agency with 43 seniors as the passengers , we have been wounded eight people on Thursday in Č@@ esk@@ é ( County ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injury , divided the police with .
the 66 years old driver of the bus company from the bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to leave their claims according to an opposite le@@ aster , which drove partly on the counter @-@ train .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ person in the police Aur@@ me / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not abandon the bus , &quot; she said .
the fires de@@ mar@@ es the in@@ mates .
six b@@ ans cars and a not@@ ary car came to the accident at the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ latest travelers were brought back from a regular bus to the Č@@ i@@ audi@@ tor &apos;s district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ator called for the vice @-@ experience and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cu@@ bic meter eff@@ lu@@ ent is starting from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ir@@ che 3.@@ 44 euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to 2,@@ 26 Euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to 2,@@ 18 Euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the san@@ itation fee will be increased later if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
after a s@@ ack@@ able calculation , the se@@ wage rates in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euro per cu@@ bic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported the approval of the budget by the property re@@ tention of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems over@@ l@@ ends .
the Kas@@ endorf Market is committed to a legal basis to cover the plant .
as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens and commercial businesses from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ir@@ che , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ ud , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the stir@@ red rises between 48 and 67 percent .
as the Board of Directors of Herbert Schmidt called the Committee , a re @-@ circulation of the fees for the se@@ wage systems of the market was necessary .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and sub @-@ covers from the previous calcul@@ ative period should be equ@@ alled .
the grace@@ ful bir@@ ths of ag@@ grav@@ ated Schmidt proved that it was packed with all three se@@ wage systems to relatively small facilities with a very small wast@@ ew@@ ater , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
this is how due to the small distribution of distribution , for instance , would have effects for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros .
additionally , the se@@ wage of water in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , during the back period of the period of time , during all three plants , not least due to their age of san@@ itation and repair applications fell into a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ir@@ che , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical ventilation system due to a damage .
the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ir@@ ch had to be over@@ hau@@ led for nearly 20 years and in the pond depth Lop@@ p had to be established after nearly 20 years of operation the first Kl@@ är@@ pond , the Kl@@ är@@ f provides and an additional ventilation to be implemented in order to keep the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on these extraordinary expendi@@ tures , the advanced tut@@ oring and maintenance costs came into account according to the new calcul@@ atory period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 were still below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that in the small wast@@ ew@@ ater in the three facilities the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , added Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs have remained spar@@ ed over the se@@ wage systems over the past 20 years .
the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious after view of stone houses , especially since one cannot expand the supply area of the se@@ wage @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal to these plants because it is a deficit of deficit .
Bulgaria ins@@ cribed for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were fully booked .
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 was roughly 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 ) amoun@@ ted to 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 amoun@@ ted to 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods were observed in July 2016 : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.@@ 7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.@@ 3 % ) .
the prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine @-@ maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ tive to races .
with its filter tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are unmistak@@ eable , autonomous tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fs per day .
all ab@@ sent@@ encing stops to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat @-@ filters have drawn up critic@@ isms in the past that they were accused of making the App Black@@ face @-@ shaped or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week some U@@ sers proposed a filter that gave them sli@@ pper@@ y , false teeth and un@@ seen che@@ eks , there were some critics of a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of A@@ sians - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot;
they asked if this repeated controversy on a larger problem was that the company with diversity has .
the news and indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat mitt@@ ent that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company provided an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of A@@ sians .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced se@@ is@@ atism , the filter at hur@@ t@@ hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
other declined to the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widely spread over the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and mild . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ top of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the fil@@ tering effects .
it shows that the filter is not ob@@ sc@@ anned , but that the yellow way@@ side was drawn to the de@@ fle@@ ction extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural cle@@ net .
the American culture appears to be implic@@ ated in an endless dialogue and integr@@ ative , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the race of race than their older players - could be expecting to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering a picture is created , that for a user is offen@@ ded , it is much more difficult to keep such things un@@ noticed when it was earlier the case , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and Ingenieur@@ gesellschaft für Medium , her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account is asking for others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a phone interview , she told they believe that ra@@ ined controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the inter@@ stell@@ ation practices in Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leaders and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin @-@ colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left untreated .
the Company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its employees and points out to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat sat down to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but according to a speech , the company recently focused on a HR assistant who focuses on under@@ presented citizens and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said that she is closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military management fal@@ si@@ fied ISIS intelligence information , represents the Committee of Congress
military members of the United States Central Command system @-@ oriented information to record an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when it would allow actual state @-@ affairs committee in a report on Thursday .
the provisional report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the Defence Forces , Secret Services , and the Wehr@@ budget , reports of great dis@@ content among central Command secret services that reported how sub@@ ordin@@ ances reported to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , briefly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military configurations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence information provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders were regularly in@@ geni@@ ously , a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism , as it would have allowed the actual state of states at the site and were consistently expressed by more positive than analysis of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership position in the Cent@@ Com range to the top head of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report contains detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government points under Obama had given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their supervis@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com has publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can congresses from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 the tops of Central Command changed the down@@ ward reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to life after they had played that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while investig@@ ating inquiries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary of Defence in progress .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com produces an over@@ ly limited process for creating tut@@ orials to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the highest democr@@ atisation in the commander , member in the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , published in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ tar@@ ded the publication of post @-@ term reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of morality and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ ps and Democrats agreed to not have found evidence of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interference of White House at Cent@@ Com analysts in terms of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by investig@@ ators carried out by the inspec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were recorded by complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
ah . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press @-@ seat of the Pentagon , gave an opinion in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would comment no reports of the Congress while investig@@ ating the inspec@@ tor are still underway .
but he also stressed that &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot;
the investigation have agreed upon the question of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Department of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of the last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on Central Command at the observ@@ ance of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the en@@ act@@ ate information about the Islamic State ab@@ outs of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts saw only a small occupation of occupation in Iraq and it was little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker concluded that contrary to government statements made by the Islamic State , had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this provisional refinement would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam @-@ owner , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lature due to its over@@ ly positive assessment of the military situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win four match in the field ho@@ ckey of the women , a show@@ down with Great Britain before
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that won the American with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember to have ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
that knows , however , the Americ@@ anism are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will join the last round of the first round on Saturday .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will gain the first and second place in each group .
the initial board is going to make a little longer the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , American people have spark@@ ed a surprising vor@@ tex , four years after they landed on the last London games at the last of 12 seats .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey sleeping in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became nation@@ alists of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 in which she and her team went all wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , and thus began to turn things for better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical shift , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work in London that we now have .
we have the Ru@@ gs to be carried out completely .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the scor@@ ches in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand from the se@@ am area .
India had gone out into play without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the playing field from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
it carried out a Sprint with a flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate around the American , a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gonzal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are in@@ capable of developing and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid tour of competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is like the olymp@@ ic f@@ ack@@ et itself would be a burning rod , which is operated by the bracel@@ et for the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes .
you cannot turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ading or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is part of the Olympic Games for the first time at the Olympic Games and would be quite under this known name , which would have been sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertisement , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic flame is not illuminated every event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized : air gun , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest@@ nut and may it reign for a long time .
but if I might make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me direct the attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline .
although the trampoline already jump since 2000 an Olympic event , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years was so spar@@ se noticed that many people I asked , did not know that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the US has sent athletes to competitions , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had made an athlete until 2012 , who made it up to the final .
the Chinese and the Russians are incl@@ ined to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on a trampoline has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ resolved ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the Olympic Games that will sound for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a er@@ ated enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never ending wol@@ ds - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports which are essentially united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rising winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , lifting and sal@@ ads ) before they land on the feet .
they are evaluated according to official Olympi@@ ad by execution , levels of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are competing in Rio .
the common Olympic vector is straight .
Med@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ hoff@@ tes must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and penetr@@ ated , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down on the playground .
you do not only chase the zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but in the television transfer also another height : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
the pur@@ pose@@ ful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I think of doing this games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
this offers the trampoline a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is up .
a for@@ wards movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ un@@ ed , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes to the top , then effortlessly back upwards .
there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no w@@ öl@@ ben in the distance , just the dre@@ amy , elegant removal of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition with the Olympic Games can be only .
the Quali@@ fication and En@@ dr@@ unden the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will be@@ aming the En@@ dr@@ unden as part of a follow @-@ up at both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil .
if the increase in consciousness can be achieved only by the anxiety and the lenses of male athletes - like the male US Tur@@ ner before the The Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air to rin@@ se , new fan@@ atics .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested in Ethiopia , Long ne ally of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters that demand political changes in Ethiopia for violent resistance by the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters have been killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in sw@@ uss@@ sion .
is Ethiopia really to break together ?
over the past ten years it has been one of Africa &apos;s stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months the protests against the government were destroyed in more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was im@@ charitable to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot at least un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
moving around the protests that probably come from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the leader of the UN Security Council for Human Rights now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep up this country and it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at the remarkable temp@@ o .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved , there is a new pend@@ ant in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations constantly continued the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereas the dissi@@ dents were sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or sent to prison , were killed or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness .
yet this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press people and do not have any other option except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation is prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground @-@ use until the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a far critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition , and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament .
at the same time tension is rising along the border with Eritrea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ ga@@ des , which were forced over the last years more or less , the turmoil will benefit and get armed .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ors are now explo@@ ding under the surface under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate via social media as cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and improved the internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are at regular intervals , especially with protests , many people can still communicate via internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies , which conc@@ eal , where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they gathered so much protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity among the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since ages prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from ae@@ dic@@ s , mainly Christian arrogan@@ ce countries , in politics and the economy , while they are the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but also this is changing .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , in secret services , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , one former re@@ bel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years in Ethiop@@ ian prime minister .
he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in it , to perceive early signs of dis@@ content and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict @-@ analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of controlled security services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia lived such a turmoil was 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to the indications of analy@@ tic seemingly fu@@ eled by the government and subsequently were stolen .
during the following swe@@ eps , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts in Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , as the new pend@@ ant train , as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic town , of Tig@@ ray guided businesses and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media .
analy@@ st say that the protests and other Western allies bring their allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighbouring Somalia , even though they recently knew that it has closed this base .
while the West definitely wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally inter@@ rup@@ ting its allies in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walk &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp has declared his claim Obama with ISIS be &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to all@@ ay the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated cont@@ en@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fications cast new questions on the communication skills of the presidential election of the re@@ public@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public .
it also brings his collaborators , who strive to take him during an eventful phase in protection , to explain to the peculiar position , statements that he could not have meant .
after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp returned to the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really was not intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply s@@ ark@@ as@@ tical .
the twe@@ et was opposed to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
being the conservative radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to weak@@ en the statement by letting him rec@@ alled that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the republi@@ can presidential election did not know anything about it .
the final storm of the critic@@ isms of Mr. Tru@@ mp came down , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to dec@@ aying envelope .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton concluded speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried again to return to this subject .
via Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics would lead to higher taxes and that he would have found their talk boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has succeeded in defending sar@@ cas@@ m to its defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism in himself , when he argued , the Russians were to bake Mrs. Clin@@ tons E@@ emails , but later he later &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to postp@@ one the language boundaries in politics and then to rec@@ ede when needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans , how they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert observed the language of both candidates .
but I think he is very clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in a different way .
instead of resol@@ ute the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp has assumed an even reck@@ less sound , since its re@@ frac@@ tional values continue to come back .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with great advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally tempted to not ap@@ olog@@ ise for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understanding his humour .
but while he is increasingly focusing on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s jo@@ kes have brought his loyal co @-@ stri@@ pe into the im@@ comfortable situation , to him no matter how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent advocates , gave great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in that sense that Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ bone , completely incorrect and because of that it came to pass the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans attempt to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton served as an out@@ minister@@ ing , it seems to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
in front of the election events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them before , on each of his words , and to be taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he under@@ mined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats ridicul@@ ed on Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once har@@ dened by the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ itation café in Williamsburg , where you could only pay Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years it was a good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed .
the store So@@ ap Ch@@ erie that put it in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people over the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ uses wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also new .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when he offered a customer to provide funds for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept much with .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are sh@@ ell@@ ations such as cap@@ ers and su@@ cked oni@@ ons .
there are natural food @-@ bow@@ ls .
the café does not serve beer anymore , there are fresh juice .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez told that he noticed a new stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was such a customer .
Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , lived in Williamsburg in Williamsburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after she was drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee table , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that fell down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she has coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended coffee table in this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coffee , a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea store , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ term and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb .
he went there before the work and ordered inv@@ ari@@ ably the same thing .
&quot; I came back to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock , and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and make new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he does not have a Gro@@ ll about that the soap business has taken up the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ ery to produce a special soap for verb with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go back to their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said he preferred to put them back soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has its advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ ler wants to fill the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building .
for many customers a new publisher is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was Chief Apostle and said he was destroyed on the floor when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the purpose of the Lok@@ et and the funer@@ al felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming .

the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as g@@ our@@ mets , President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles .
his menu on that day was a little more modest : cor@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ lau@@ men@@ pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and are both food histori@@ ography .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about living in a residential home at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest co @-@ operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snor@@ kel food in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the stock of stock in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh k@@ äs@@ es@@ and@@ rel with olive grove , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables .
as the re@@ porter h@@ ackers ordered , this found the couple to have a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was crude bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little endor@@ ous that sends the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as supp@@ er .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have laid down in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was freshly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the ways with which the country had turned out to be no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lar@@ ing land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beg@@ ged Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as stra@@ ined was the new bud@@ get@@ s@@ own : mysterious foods such as lo@@ aves and k@@ asser@@ s were used to stap@@ le food , the water remains as &quot; wonderful way , eating remains as &quot; wonderful kind , eating remains un@@ reliable , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a mu@@ ddy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by che@@ er dr@@ y@@ ob@@ st .
meat that was at the center of the American cuisine , became a rare ser@@ ene luxury .
peculiar compounds were tried , because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had priority over tastes or even healthy kitchen .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no popular addition for lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues on : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the utility recipes .
as never before or since then , bud@@ get@@ ary bud@@ get@@ ary - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 up to 1943 saw the food habits of the country .
by published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household policies &quot; and the challenge , pamp@@ as like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historic ti@@ d@@ bits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , taste@@ ful the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ dinner post@@ ure .
while he openly praised the simple Iowa farm cuisine of his cuisine , spe@@ iste he like the millions of millions of world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was lovely un@@ realistic .
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake when not his wife Ele@@ anor had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate a stamp with his stomach .
as described in the book the squ@@ ad introduced a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roo@@ sev@@ elt , that the White House brought the boring food in Washington but also one of the most comfor@@ ted food prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food was rejected once the land came back on the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science has been applied to foods .
the pair gave better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man in law @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the wast@@ age of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded itself : &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall .
after the dishes were evacu@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e had emerged one dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums , the president Roo@@ sev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to send a fancy name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no s@@ wind@@ y cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone do@@ ve a bit reluct@@ antly a spoon into the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly enough it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e got three times a stroke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A couple of wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ ed everything to save another life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old had died in a façade @-@ bomb attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &apos; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that saved up to 6@@ 0.000 people &apos;s life according to picture @-@ Zeitung .
2@@ 900 volunteers do their own lives on the play to educate people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make their first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil worker , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour saving of a house from the ruins of a house , went in 2014 around the world .
it made the Syri@@ ans the shining symbols in the di@@ gest of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as heroes , he never saw himself , said according to the picture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die , save life , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attack in Syria .
the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have ki@@ cked four fac@@ bombs over the Alzheimer &apos;s district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .

the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest flu@@ idi@@ tier is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland usually come to surface only in winter .
the shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board the s@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to date .
Greenland can only get offspring with 150 years of offspring .
leis@@ ur@@ ely s@@ nu@@ des the Greenland shar@@ k at the bottom of the northern Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it comes to arrives , the five meters long animal speeds up to 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be with this top speed .
but this of long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a pan@@ acea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at least one Greenland who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock these life @-@ span , which means a world @-@ ch@@ ord for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already suspected that Greenland are st@@ ony old .
only lacking the evidence .
Greenland are difficult to watch , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sv@@ alb@@ ard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they mostly appear in the surface only in the winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland researchers too little .
her time @-@ pent@@ ag@@ o measures them when they re@@ com@@ promised six animals with a transm@@ itter .
loot make these sh@@ arks still : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a ro@@ be , another had s@@ lu@@ cked the j@@ aw of a young ic@@ bear .
possibly chase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice me@@ zz@@ ling and looking for car@@ c@@ asses , that tor@@ ates from higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now explored 28 Green@@ land@@ a , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ etres long , while the largest 50@@ 2 cen@@ timeter .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the Lin@@ sen@@ ker of Ha@@ ie with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eyel@@ et is already developed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , which contain them contained in it later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ ers .
therefore , after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons , try to s@@ lugg@@ ish large amounts of this radi@@ ant carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
in the length of the smallest animal @-@ 14 inches in the length of the smallest animal , the lin@@ sen@@ is against the nuclear weapon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland in their l@@ itter on the other hand had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 centimeters long Greenland an old of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters can be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Green@@ land@@ hai @-@ female will only get offspring when they are longer than four meters .
now , the researchers were able to assign the length of an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters are probably on the br@@ ink of sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie is obviously at least one and a half centuries time .
also this is likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Green@@ land@@ wal , in whose bac@@ on on the neck a 120 year old Har@@ po@@ on top , was captured on Alaska .
due to low temperatures often the organism of the animals living there are also spar@@ ed animals .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm water warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal is heating .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram Eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , a very big animal should invest his resources rather in a long life .

with topics around the building , the community at the latest meeting is focused on the latest session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the board took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven living space could begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt has benefited most from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of Kompetenz@@ fel@@ ds financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether budgets must continue to operate from London in the entire EU .
so far for the so @-@ called European passport is the approval in the UK .
this just uses big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ bying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is counting on 10,000 new jobs in the Main Event five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the Eurozone &apos;s largest banks , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the Not@@ en@@ bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg has a large fund , cutting , but as well as Dublin as in the infrastructure worse .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach in Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
furthermore points the city with slightly available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not as easy to find free quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Seine are also rents for first class business properties at 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frankfurt will also offer a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer &apos;s consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stand in place seven , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ W ref@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in spite of the Bre@@ xit vote on the most important financial center in Europe , I will keep my business researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also explains power relations : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead will receive ownership of the Hepatitis C patent @-@ dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US office decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to a refund of the legal costs that you have created from the Hep@@ ati@@ st C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a flood of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents in Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , having a US judge a pattern of mis@@ conduct of Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other in@@ ethical actions .
when the law@@ suit was filed on Thursday , US @-@ minister@@ ial @-@ in Bethel , Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decre@@ e the cost , which arose during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize Gilead , which dominate the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicine , which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead , and Mer@@ ck advoc@@ ated one mutually exclusive and possession of laboratory work , including the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir @-@ Cer@@ tification , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
by the US supported troops they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
supported by the US supported troops have rec@@ laimed complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS comb@@ at@@ ants left in the city , said a spokes@@ man on the group on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the exo@@ dus of the remaining united group of fighters who have excav@@ ated within the city , currently the city .
they have delivered over 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ ing the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Re@@ uters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just lead orders through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Re@@ uters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ics earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton published its tax return for 2015 , which revealed a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million to the presidential election of USD 10.@@ 75 million , and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ t USD 1 million finished for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton had a income of USD 3 million by the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her ten@@ ure in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ ics candidate for the vice @-@ presidential guard , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , released together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax statements of the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards with respect to financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ ique Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri was announced in an opinion .
in a cr@@ ass contradiction to this , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false interpre@@ tations and dra@@ gging in relation to his former correspon@@ den@@ ces to release his control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to release their tax results , although they are not obliged by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for his denial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ ics &quot; campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential and Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax checks are not completed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things also the republi@@ can presidential election of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his ref@@ usal questions regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its business associations and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already been pl@@ ung@@ ed on the subject and published a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ ranking Re@@ public@@ ans Tru@@ mp demand his tax return .
on Thursday she talked about the subject even during a speech on the economy of Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential election has done in recent decades and release his tax expl@@ ain@@ ers . &quot; she said to the crowd .
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has been paid for two years with no or only very little taxes , and a business journalist at the New York Times cited on Friday a number of tax advis@@ ors and tax advis@@ ers , the information that this could still be the case .
federal control has become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton provides a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett to ensure that individuals earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal too .
during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tru@@ mp has to exchange at a meeting in order to exchange control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ers said he was just as well as a control examination of the IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ics campaign has released tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ ics , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax declaration at Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income are related as wages , unlike most of all Americans .
its main joint joint was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ Fund from which the Clin@@ ics divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 controlled .

condoms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works by encouraging anc@@ ani@@ as Eleph@@ ant protection
nature Conservation in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from it , in people inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them that are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ bic .
the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation that had already begun years ago , together with the US conservation field , having trained volunteers in villages in the north of Tanz@@ ani@@ as , to use a non@@ violent quad@@ rat method to protect their houses and harvest without being injured .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is a puppy day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed this ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe within these municipalities a change of their attitude , being able to hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; expressed the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message .
the first two steps will include the illumin@@ ants of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into one horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not out@@ stretched , a so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ li@@ clou@@ dy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

when it is lit , the con@@ dom with a kno@@ b and spr@@ inkl@@ ing fine dust at Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ er in the air .
a hint of law is usually already out to chase the eleph@@ ants .
a last possibility is an adver@@ tis@@ ation which sho@@ ots a gold @-@ fire in the air and thereby causing a lu@@ te , bright explosion .

the request for the construction of a sale of sale at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ h@@ kon@@ s , the City Council now entered into this end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new business operators , but at this location in a privileged position on the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , this ki@@ osk does not fit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish chore@@ ograp@@ her Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; lic@@ itation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch , after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre @-@ election as there were Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the destination of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol has a possibility to choose Israel through its own call center .
after a statement , the director approached the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel set said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was , extingu@@ ished in the director even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das merchant , called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Southern German newspaper .
we were dis@@ coura@@ ged and troubled by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this has worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a even greater shame . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dissolved a fairly large resonance on the internet in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some sub@@ set the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there would have been the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed , &quot; called it in another post that was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly referred to all alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; verb@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel does not include in the fast @-@ selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung proclaimed a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ ner against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students en@@ camp@@ ed on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered themselves to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police brought a lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and rubber @-@ talks on the prot@@ esters .
the difficulties began as police officers tried to rub the students , which led to the police to immig@@ rate rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the proposals by the Govern@@ ors of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the participants were seen gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er at walls .
the recent protests occurred several days after demonstrators in masses on the streets to support the suspended President D@@ il@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismis@@ sed from the Office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Teheran in the yearly , was equivalent to 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , interest in Russian enterprises and businesses grew strongly in the country , shared with the Ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market .
of course , the further merchant expansion is one of the biggest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of year 2016 amoun@@ ted to 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and bet@@ aded $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the swing swing was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes out for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian foreign representatives given around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , first and foremost , travel to Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries , affecting the number of tourist attractions in Russia .
one could say that the record @-@ paid tourists in Russia from last year , broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes to change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of Mer@@ cy
the min@@ ist@@ rants from the sea @-@ past@@ es unit E@@ yes @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on their way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
together four stages have been tackl@@ ed .
in order to bridge the time up to the next check @-@ on of all Min@@ ist@@ rants in less than two years , the top round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage objectives has been tested and finally decided for the Bishop of Freiburg , where in this year at the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage goal was given to the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ a bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ oms were on the way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and divided the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ a was driven by train at the starting point in Vill@@ ingen , where a Münster was one of the loved ones , and thus the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges became the pilgrimage path of the Münster .
the individual day tours were en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and writing .
but on the way , the Min@@ is at Feld@@ kreu@@ z , chap@@ els or churches have always been re@@ ast to sing together a song of peculiar pilgrims @-@ lifts .
for the nights the parish priests of the local parish were available .
at the milestone , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for sav@@ our@@ y as well as stronger dinner and breakfast .

after the service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ r@@ ist@@ y and the high altar .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening at the Men &apos;s Sprint at the Vel@@ o@@ rom in Rio for fame , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the an@@ ker@@ chief , who had made his Land@@ mark Sir Chris Ho@@ y himself . the young and made the legend proud when he hal@@ ted home to get a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England had four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympi@@ ans .
she reiter@@ ated the trick , after her in March at the railway @-@ world championship in London despite the rel@@ apse was only a modest sixth place .
the issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement generated a gap , the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt cr@@ acks trying to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they remained , when they saw the potential in the car@@ rots it un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - which won four years ago with Ho@@ y and Sk@@ inner set up a Olympi@@ ad rounds , but in the stand @-@ round of New Zealand &apos;s New Zealand in the first lap .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his round was scar@@ ed , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy of strategy made a big part of transformation , when adding a higher gear to slow@@ ing him down , and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y watched from his position as BBC an expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des upon , when they climbed up on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make myself a name .
we have been placed in the En@@ dr@@ unde a Olympi@@ ad and the world Champion was defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , hints of that he fell to the train after a weak start .
he moved this statement later and there was no objection of England Rival .
with such a phenomenal victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
we have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 titles have been won both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ o@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the field of possible that he repeated victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would mean for Kenn@@ y - which is exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently sacred date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - a collection of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the Che@@ ese of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes appear next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ all@@ ists contest , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four o@@ dom@@ eter race .
you arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 on the destination .
the World Cup , which won in London in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ lu@@ ster will focus on safety .
he had stri@@ pped up before the qualification yesterday , when they called function@@ aries to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women competition where tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ ado period in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a s@@ ar of medals .
after a truly exceptional display of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio has been shut down .
it will also play Dr@@ amas in the background as the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and bullying and retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton .
but if you look at the first evening of competition at the Vel@@ o@@ rom , it looks like the British reputation GB@@ s , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the mel@@ ting of Portland because of the lifting of the energy @-@ consumption
the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake as the plant operator denoun@@ ce the energy supply and thus all supply agreements will lift the energy supplier .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to use the plant .
a pay@@ load for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Portland are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closing time .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ effects , as the mel@@ ting around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 Al@@ coa finished the Point of Henry Mel@@ ting , which led last year to a close to the an@@ gler power station .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risky a closure .
this step follows long years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian Dollars and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ tdown with its Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with the fact that three additional owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese companies C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold minor proportions .
&quot; AG@@ L is assuming that the plant in Portland continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting , &quot; shared the company .
AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so called &quot; backup business &quot; that would have been able to enter into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L is assuming that contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the revenue on AG@@ L starting from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ations for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared with that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in the anticip@@ ation of a cancellation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to charge the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capability of Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mel@@ ting to operate or provide the power supply to the mel@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not com@@ promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that it has completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation , why it is res@@ igned by the contract .
analy@@ st warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex in the vicinity of Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen announced that Portland is using about 600 me@@ ga@@ watt and Tom@@ ago about 900 me@@ ga@@ watts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would signi@@ fy a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as an electricity producer this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Car@@ di@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and went to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this cover to wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unvei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , embro@@ i@@ dered reality video that ends the whole Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as they have forgotten the cover of their sister and concludes with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party .
this represents the kl@@ is@@ che@@ e@@ un@@ eas@@ ed action nearly every birthday of a child &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest assured the sentence , &quot; you said that we would have forgotten ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon ball on a broadcast@@ er at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to leave their other girls somehow with this publicity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the Sept@@ ember@@ ing of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began .
K@@ end@@ all great sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned , ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the covers of the September of the magazine is a League for himself .
the sep@@ ten@@ ary is for vo@@ gue the most sold issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , which resembles rather a picture @-@ band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( Acc@@ ording Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were on the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unvei@@ ling of his co@@ ver@@ stars is predicted that in the last two years images of the magazine have been abandoned before the official announcement .
women who were already at the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ity , the mod@@ alities &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , the celeb@@ rities &quot; are on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ istr@@ ate and Di@@ or brand Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 at the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - that is described from the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation - it is in good company .
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous individuals or reality stars or youth of today that know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if all of them apply to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly gi@@ fted women who are drawing up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade of one of the most successful years of her career .
naturally Jen@@ ners &apos;s success does not like to everyone .
with its reality @-@ TV history , Jen@@ ners &apos;s position in the fashion world was somewhat tense .
in June critici@@ zed the ein@@ ist Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the mist@@ y of the moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ed back high , when the message came out with the appearance of Jen@@ ners on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but it seems to be wander@@ ing on the mis@@ mouth seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold by her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centers each year more than 160@@ ,000 people each year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s most important aid centers will be arranged annually by the municipal centres centres , while the sector has already taken over the effects of further medium @-@ abbrevi@@ ations to already over@@ run transactions .
in Queensland , three of five people are already considered , mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ oc@@ ations and similar ones - in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ crowded , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting June next year it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of the Municipal Executive Committee of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal Community centres revealed that thousands of people were rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without the repe@@ al of the compl@@ aining of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; que@@ er community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ manage@@ able and pressing debts , families , which were released by separ@@ ations , workers , the un@@ just ones - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpl@@ ess people are forced to Queensland with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and the Federal Justice Minister as well as the Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to lift it up to date , so people get the help they need to get in legal problems .
last year , the provincial government met their commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp campaign against employee supposedly charged weapon
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s Camp@@ a@@ ign was indicted for alleged in@@ action after her was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina was directed to an employee during February while in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the Landes@@ court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programming for the campaign in this federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave us to have waited for a monthly , that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right po@@ ke on the de@@ duction , and r@@ ammed the course in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; says B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment .
after having compl@@ ained in local and regional campaign guidance , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip , he gave to the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be f@@ aded to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the charge comes only two days after the republi@@ can presidential election , as he said a crowd in North Carolina , saying that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment &quot; People &quot; - Cho@@ uss@@ a land@@ owner and arms @-@ dogs - take action should be elected to ap@@ point its Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton and ap@@ point the judges .
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was clear that media had gotten his words from the context and that he would not rise to violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ ance complaint requests claims by the campaign for violation of the due di@@ ligence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of Philip because of the post@@ ur@@ ging and abi@@ ding spiritual damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope Hi@@ cks had not been reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip was just as absent .
W@@ CC@@ B , a local news stations in Charlotte , announces that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign .
calls for calls on his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on EU elections : SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses are drawing to the governing party SPD and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be representative pol@@ ls of the public opinion research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black governmental coalition in the north could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good opportunities to continue to minister Prime Minister .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD of 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent increased to 24 percent more than five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was conducted only shortly before the CD@@ U , who could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the African .
the left arrived at 19 per cent ( previously 18 : 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 per cent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
the Gre@@ ens hes@@ it@@ ly despite slight losses with 6 percent ( before 8.@@ 7 percent ) again into the heav@@ y@@ day of land .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented by 3 per cent in the country &apos;s day .
during the Berlin Dec@@ or@@ ne@@ al code , the SPD from the survey was reached only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 per cent after 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
they therefore still have the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left side with 15 percent ( 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the branch of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would certainly be missed in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9@@ Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator arrived on the market .
the successor today dominate the world - his maker lived a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ os and it was as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and larger , so it was not good in his hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cked .
the built @-@ in memory was at first eight me@@ gab@@ ytes , that would reach today for approximately two sel@@ ars with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 Gigab@@ yte .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow originate from the Stone Age of the Inter@@ net .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the CeBIT in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West Bank format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web sites was possible via HTML @-@ browser , albeit agon@@ izing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be up similar to a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of a smart phones in Germany was at 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody could imagine in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the cell @-@ saving of the Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ parall@@ eled disaster , was eventually sold and handled in Microsoft .
today we dominate the market today that all came a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always and everywhere will be online today , this is for many people today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1,4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million pieces .
worldwide sales with the devices is around 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are coming up .
around the smartphone has now developed a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was first introduced in early 2007 , at the time , Apple Chef Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet @-@ communication , everything is easy to use via touch screen .
the strainer of Apple began , still today is the iPhone the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , which dominated the market , had the after@@ market .
they eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
now the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asi@@ atic providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after his invention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture every German today is looking for 88 times a day on his cell phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must learn all the smartphone , even now , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr. Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens @-@ board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now permanent lo@@ ad@@ ability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the olymp@@ ic spirit and throw He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw is not only in our local commun@@ es and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as we were in London in 2012 when we have a great deal to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this once again by offering new opportunities for local and companies close to He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities we will have already 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , create new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ unt us on the world stage .
the branches had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any given question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for single infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ty growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in all GB .
we have a great team to He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s top airport terminal , until the T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver on a third run , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw is also one .
it is time that we will direct this olymp@@ ic mind and throw He@@ a@@ throw as well as creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding display block
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , they earn advertising , ad blocking , a &quot; cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game &quot; equal .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisers on his desktop , released Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ gger where it hur@@ ts that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that his Des@@ k@@ top@@ us would change the co@@ ding with regard to his ad to display it advertisers the detection of which part of the page is advertising to detect .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to byp@@ ass new codes .
in a blo@@ gger post the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle is underway between the casual open source community and the ren@@ ders already since the invention of ad @-@ lock@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest business has left for social media in the fight , is a strong Indian indicator , how worrying ad @-@ cur@@ ation@@ er has become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people display advertisers ; nearly four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users , who access Facebook through their mobile devices makes hand@@ y@@ earning 84 percent of the advertising revenue generated by Facebook .
the company has no effect on display block on desktop PCs except for mobile ad lock blocking any effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ agram , shared a spokes@@ person .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue , so that Facebook appears to invest such a step as a worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday shared Facebook with that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad prize pool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to put people more control over it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook confi@@ dently affir@@ m that ad@@ vices would be worrying because they could also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this does not represent positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt agent , which is why we instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control over the hands of the people .
woman with suspected su@@ icide on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses , after a woman in the early hours of the morning was handed over to a suspected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman slept in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were met by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a per@@ ch at the age of 49 years , that has been handed over by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , was transferred , himself wanted to kill .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident required to report .
it became a investig@@ ating procedure opened what a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation is divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve with .
but it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clash prev@@ ent@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases , when a person ran on the highway on the highway - was decided that the motor@@ ists must not assume that a pedestrian amidst the night on the highway runs as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ emen was acqu@@ itted of the casual killing , after having left a man and killed , who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had dr@@ unken and became unconscious on the street , rejected the court .
the court proved that the police officers who had responded to a call -- in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ een situation &quot; was the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident occurring on Thursday near Morges , should register with the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate @-@ od@@ ell .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate research .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus with its hot , water @-@ tight surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have been re@@ formed .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow de@@ rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , similar atmosphere could have had , and nevertheless slowly revol@@ ved .
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to live life and protect life more quickly .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation exp@@ on@@ izes the slow transformation of Venus its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a dense layer of clouds , which acts as a rain @-@ screen to shield the surface from a large portion of the sun@@ ning .
the result are average temperatures that have some degree more cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that has previously been suspected by planetary research .
although it was once inhab@@ itable the Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ too much heat and ultra @-@ violet light exposed .
her Oce@@ ans darker and their water vap@@ or was burned down by the ultra @-@ violet light .
as her hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate @-@ od@@ ell in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer for the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy entered back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado and led to a low level of cooperation in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado River with energy , passion and determination , &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
I have long been thinking about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth , it needs it and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly adapted to the organisation &apos;s organisation .
he must also have a right decision on making decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , which had addressed Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been winning the Best coaches of the League during its debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 as the best coach of the league .
he brought the club on 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten and missed in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second game spot in the Western Conference to return five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ were Roy four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ workers resume talks , strike a strike
the work struggles for mun@@ er@@ ation for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ workers are exposed , while all the issues set to sit on the table for a new round of discussion , said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil field service providers Wood Group were carried out spor@@ a@@ dically on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and the trade unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the process of current struggle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will keep some full @-@ day meetings over the coming weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems anew . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible pay@@ lines of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has shortened this year to its contracts in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage decline for on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that additional cuts in the enterprise gives the required space to get through the down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
shell has released for its part of thousands of people released and announced plans to abandon his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries because its business activities as a result of its meg@@ az@@ re@@ mit with the British energy company BG Group is to be ration@@ alized .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that has been reinforced by the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish parliament@@ arians , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest workplaces that have been going on for a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy which works for many and not just for a few &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to be on expenditure for new projects in the North Sea as compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ pet@@ als of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ space tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ary rates among the stars of the star P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in star@@ tup to different instal@@ ments as well as in what context are the rotation periods with the planetary development .
&quot; we hope that we learn through the compar@@ isons of our results with other constell@@ ations , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos; Infr@@ ar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , can now reach adul@@ thood .
you are now turning the fastest .
at peak rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars emerge large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if a star is alter@@ ing , its rotation rate begins to dec@@ eler@@ ate .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star , by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star -- like sun@@ spots --
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ary rates points out that a more massive star is turning slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , which are turning more stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ters than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the star bapti@@ sm@@ s of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the star bapti@@ sm@@ s of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and elderly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , W@@ ann and why stars turn their rotation mar@@ ry and to say so to say their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the ple@@ ads of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star emerges
the tears run at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball @-@ star in best days from base to base .
after his emotional rel@@ apse announcement , the 41 year old professional will take place on August 12 against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays one last time the tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez was the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a tenth of year deal was given to him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contrac@@ tions on 31 December 2017 , he will work together as a consultant and youth coach .
as players paid it Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed some milestones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays are only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values .
however , in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be accepted .
because as successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field was , so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was launched in 2009 between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was locked in the so @-@ called Bio@@ Genesis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main suspi@@ cious , for years about an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida @-@ promoting means .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I had played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said then sweet .
even his farewell days have not been sli@@ pped .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games still get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez was frequently to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves the attempt to win any game , &quot; added Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress of Kate arrived , sympathy the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Mountains rival@@ ed Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez Team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first Dop@@ pler
wi@@ pes : because of a positive Dop@@ pler , Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio cannot start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games in 2016 are o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official dop@@ amine .
a wi@@ ped athlete could have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day the first official d@@ ots of the Olympic Games are known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter barriers from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical eye @-@ competitions these messages come to the in@@ time .
at Ch@@ en the Di@@ ure@@ tics hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a growing agent for d@@ ots .
the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final for over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the procedures over 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample during the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) for the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association should take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seriously and require full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also at night of Rio released the message about the positive trial at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it may be inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the athle@@ tics area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is intended to act on the bot@@ t@@ len@@ ght EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ sample should be very positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w announces immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ en@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , for example , all the wei@@ ght@@ li@@ the@@ tics may not be part of the chron@@ ically dec@@ eas@@ ed nation in the Rio .
on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic stadium was tested in the class until 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had been positive on the an@@ abo@@ lic stero@@ ids N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class until 94 kg .
in front of the start of Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian crew to the launch because of the systematic synthesis of Kenya , also the L@@ ę@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming @-@ sport , the earlier ver@@ ages in China had also taken care of fierce disputes between the athletes .
thus the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ad Sun Yang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ ing@@ li@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium about 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to commit myself , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio .
the Sun was also the center of a discussion with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping che@@ aters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese Championships on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
Daten@@ k@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ ackers broke their ran@@ som
programmers of press@@ mal@@ ware are currently taking part targeted companies - and are successful in this .
according to a recent survey of Mal@@ ware &apos;s specialists in Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies surve@@ yed over the past twelve months at least once , partially repeated victims of a attack with black@@ out software .
in Germany nearly 20 percent of companies have already been the aim of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly the sol@@ der demanded by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alize their black@@ out software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential ty@@ ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of harm software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ cy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programmes were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetrators discovered black@@ mail software for himself .
only there were private purposes , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying rapidly in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware currently works on a simple pattern : once on the computer of an option , it looks for long @-@ long changed files such as Word@@ press , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as the archives of images and videos .
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the black@@ out .
to get the final de@@ cryp@@ ting code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ ages Bit@@ coin .
however , where with private users , the personal photo database is on the game , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware proposes .
22 percent of affected German firms involved in sales loss by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the business completely , in case of a case people were in life of life .
in Germany , several hundred hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims always : pays off , but it only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , will get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in operation .
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure the commercial areas and the contact with black@@ out agents are examined and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims by chat on how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set free access sites or en@@ code for example files .
and shall individuals rede@@ emed by payments of a few hund@@ red@@ ths of Euros , companies must negotiate a bit hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail the h@@ ackers are getting professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from anti@@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
more likely , however , it is three or four people .
the programmers sell their pollut@@ ants then in the form of a software construction to the actual black@@ smith .
the previous Mal@@ ware kits were created by the Mal@@ ware themselves , advising and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a custom@@ ization tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ heads are then looking for more h@@ ackers to spread the newly bought software under the victims .
we are living in a service sector .
so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buying the set of a criminal and asked another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per in@@ approved calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , the criminals then carry sp@@ ammer with the spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that provide their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust in order to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpetrators instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by doing so , the damage , depending on the type of data is still much higher than before .
the perpetrators could also take entirely new goals on the internet of things .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , how they could get used with the Internet to obtain thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the bol@@ dness of such a blocking heating could be quite a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in the Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and common@@ place
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , in everyday life proves to be extremely flexible .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is falling off .
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not just a trunk area of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ set and 10@@ 26 l at the cl@@ apping back , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the bench of the back@@ bench can be cl@@ apped up like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceiling 1.@@ 24 m high .
the luggage room is well ventil@@ ated , but the load @-@ height with 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,@@ 6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 PS acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 N@@ m in wide speed areas very powerful .
but he is likely to judge his job a little qui@@ eter .

there is another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l @-@ pet@@ rol with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
the equipment can be made in the top @-@ version &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes open .
for the security systems the City @-@ Not@@ brake duc@@ tor ( operates until speed 32 ) , the collision system and the spine @-@ resistant .

two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI @-@ jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are a bit awkward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ Diesel are fine .
who does not want to invest so much , will receive Ben@@ zin@@ er from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 exhau@@ st standard .

Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
for one liability is only thin@@ kable at dangers that are typical of air traffic , argued the Ober@@ National Court of Düsseldorf ( AZ . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken up with the fall of a knee br@@ istle .
but the accident could have occurred everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paid the organizer
dise@@ ased holiday makers get back after their trip only then money back when the cause of the disease is doubt@@ ful in the hotel .
but that is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in this case , a family on the second day of their Turkish competition was difficult to exp@@ el diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
it spent almost all of the holidays in the room .
the disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective purification plant , which allegedly pl@@ ast@@ ered the sea@@ water .
the family was that the trip was with it faul@@ ty - and compl@@ ained against the organizer .
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
though the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was in fact def@@ ective .
however , the organizer just drove before the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to proceed until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information duties , so the judgment .
especially since in the samples of the water no im@@ pur@@ ities were found .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly because of infection with each other - belonging to the general life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were fallen ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , the violence perpetr@@ ated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July would have reported a lot of people against further attacks .
the state must be b@@ uns and determined to respond to terrorist attacks at the same time .
of course : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hate and split .
this triumph we will not give the terrorists .
if the perpetrators would have to leave the country more quickly , but the security and strength also increase the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to implement the proposals by the Bundestag in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also announced another person@@ elle rein@@ forcement of the security forces , namely the medium @-@ sized order of more than several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be back under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , the weapons are so ins@@ ulated , that most importantly the purchase of weapons in the internet is complicated .
the last much discussed silence @-@ seeing for doctors is to remain protected after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctors &quot; health , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the threat of citizens could be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke about mental abnorm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds better social care for them .
teachers need to be better prepared to deal with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
in pursuit of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of o@@ vers@@ ed investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the interior ministers clearly expressed itself against shareholders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear@@ ring for the sni@@ ff in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , Ru@@ fe had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the double citizenship .
a general ban on full wear , he cling to constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitu@@ tionally .
one cannot for@@ bid for what you re@@ jects , and I refused to carry the bur@@ ka .

better traffic @-@ flow on the highway br@@ inger
it looks regularly on the road road - here a picture of November .
but this shall change : the legal bi@@ dding shall be extended .
this is good news for all cars that are in traffic on the ambient road every night in the traffic street , when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road to road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer street and the departure Wes@@ ter road the road junction at 700 metres .
motor@@ ists can then take directly from the hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : traffic may become premature , whereby the total of the total system of the Bundes@@ straße 51 will be improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District of Münster @-@ West .
the suspension on the dri@@ ve@@ way anno@@ ys the motor@@ ists above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the set@@ back goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is that the needle was lying on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ ter Straße .
from here , traffic will only be guided via the highway bridge .
the second trail had to be built back well in three quarters .
the reason : static calculations had been revealed that the bridge no longer has the required load force , in order to accommodate above all the heavy @-@ load traffic .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the related daily traffic situation will last , he cannot say .
however , it is expected to be reck@@ oned with years : for the bridge has an official rest @-@ length up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal bi@@ dding , the state of affairs is deliberately picked in the school holidays because with disabilities to reck@@ on .
the traffic is run on Tuesday and Wednesday @-@ lane on the construction site .
inter @-@ cultural journey : culture offers for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; intercultural journey &quot; we visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the staging in the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background to the aim of attending schools with welcome classes , within the scope of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the young people of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , of the cens@@ or@@ ical pictures and video anim@@ ations , it had been possible to follow the course of action , nevertheless the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wes@@ ter@@ berg from linguistic , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical project .
from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years of age should be able to get professional courses in the fields of voc@@ als , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the field of theatri@@ cal and theatri@@ cal lingu@@ istics are planning .
the project &quot; intercultural journey &quot; goes on .

rain instead of cold cuts : hope for weather monitoring
the weather has made the star sc@@ rub of Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany during the night to Friday a note through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night is bad for clouds and rain bad for watching the heavenly spectacle , said the chair of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we certainly see many star@@ ters in the sky .
with the ast@@ o@@ ks it is per@@ ple@@ ts , which belong with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the quick@@ est star .
they have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you come around for ever , at night you are awake hours awake , in the morning is already far before the che@@ ec@@ ker@@ ing@@ ling no longer think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
any@@ how , one with such problems is in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of the adults &apos;s adult disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or in@@ gestion ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there can be diverse causes underlying them , stres@@ sing Hans @-@ Günter We@@ mol@@ ded , board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eving Research and Sle@@ eving Medicine .
what you can see beneath it , but is the in@@ som@@ nia , so one inhal@@ ation and sle@@ ep@@ tive disorder .
right now , many people experience as uns@@ atis@@ fying or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Board member in the German Building association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is there to sleep ?
the causes of in@@ gestion are complex .
behind this can organic , mental or mal@@ adjusted factors , but also medicines are stuck .
not rarely is the sleeping @-@ disorder expression of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early waking up is mostly common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ mol@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that different factors are op@@ pressive .
those who for example has a sli@@ pped disk can lie bad , is waking up every two to three hours and starts eager to salute about everyday problems and worry , there is We@@ mol@@ ding an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one be with sle@@ eves to the doctor ?
who for over a period of one month in at least three nights per week is not well sleeps and the day is com@@ promised , should go to the doctor , betra@@ y white .
the impair@@ ment can look completely different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical gri@@ ev@@ ances such as stomach or headaches .
to allevi@@ ate the fil@@ tering , it is important to figure out their causes .
as a treatment options , among other things behaviour changes , cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or even medicines - classic bed@@ clothes are only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ demand .
low @-@ trained sleeping Medical Diagnos@@ is in Germany hardly , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore one should turn to sleep problems first at first to the doctor , betra@@ ying We@@ mol@@ t .
the can be clear with investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for examining in the sleeping labor medicine he rates for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory diseases , in sleeping @-@ life @-@ fatigue , for sleeping @-@ like , or if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ tive disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
actually , you do not have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after wir@@ ing , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap , and a ant@@ enn@@ ae by the finger .
also , a camera on the blan@@ ket draws the bed@@ side .
how can the problems be able to handle the problems ?
there are quite a lot of wheel@@ chairs where you can put on a better sleep .
white @-@ mol@@ ded counts : regular bed@@ - and lifts , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV , alcohol , and at night not wait for the watch - then one begins to reck@@ on immediately , and this is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German float Markus Dei@@ bler expressed himself by Facebook to disap@@ point the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 , he took the first time in Doha for the first time in Doha and introduced his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler took place in front of his ex @-@ team colleagues in front of his criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ ad gets 20,000 € premi@@ ums and a jun@@ k 15@@ 0.000 € , nobody should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page .
the conve@@ yor system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , the d@@ oping , however very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote so much and do not work closely with the issue of d@@ oping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping @-@ agency Germany ( Nada ) .
this is how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled a certain amount of time before the WC / OS of independent supervis@@ ors of the W@@ ada / F@@ ina , must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for election ham@@ bur@@ gers who now operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Car@@ di@@ gs arrest
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the airport Düsseldorf
civilian f@@ ren@@ ders of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police took over the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ ars had committed more than gang and baggage @-@ se@@ wn pil@@ es .
against 21.@@ 30 pm civilian officials realized in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from past th@@ iev@@ es .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and were collaborative , work@@ space and particularly professional .
the specialists in the C@@ ID @-@ Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can have entered the th@@ iev@@ es , which they had entered to the oppression of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four actions .
in the process they had a total of more than 15@@ ,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lenses , in between the rest of the rest of the head : the Riga @-@ Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in appears at first glance , but the police force them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes on game places , a fresh@@ man nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; anoin@@ ted . &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ d@@ l who will soon be demol@@ ished , is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new flats for rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; trendy &quot; &quot; trendy city &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , but in recent weeks it will be prefer@@ ed with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants of rental contracts , on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , Hen@@ kel had repeatedly called for a hard action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after June 22nd , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , were cleared with 300 police officials , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , sper@@ sed parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile construction workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and a day later moved police and builders under the ju@@ bel of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
at this summer afternoon the road works peaceful : parents go walking with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking to vor@@ es Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
left violence is not the main names of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kiev since 1999 and Jan@@ a * , who raise three children here , are primarily gener@@ alized by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern against increasing ten@@ ant and v@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a p@@ j@@ z who wish for a majority of Poli@@ ze@@ isch@@ utz on the left of v@@ and@@ ali@@ on left .
the dit@@ ch , that of the Berlin interior and the police between home@@ ers and their neighbors , does not exist , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in im East Ber@@ lins was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which also has a low average of poverty today compared to the rest of the city .
also , house@@ keeping and the native projects have long been part of the for@@ ti@@ z : in 1990 numerous homes have been occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire mother@@ hood street very near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police station , many of the projects in Riga have been leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the part of the city has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : they now share the inhabitants of GDR @-@ times and former imperial occupied their j@@ aw .
this is reflected in the rents that have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one re@@ alizes them in a sle@@ ep@@ ed sli@@ ces , or freshly sha@@ ded faç@@ ades , which were rejected with colours .
no other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot;
one reason is that not all neighbours might consider that as a problem , it could not necessarily be affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury , according to polic@@ emen , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of the criminal off@@ ences make assessments that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , there cannot be any talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is important : people in 94 are their neighbours that have not been determined .
even the famous burning cars give it right in the Rig@@ s for no longer any longer .
for the studied architect her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga Street and stayed .
therefore it was also important for her to get back their street : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July .
but in the eyes of Bed@@ s , as the Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by sighted new buildings in former buildings that push the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately property apartments , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if one never he@@ ars someone ?
there are frustration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for those drawn out about colour bombs , Ker@@ stin has little understanding : the house@@ projects and the left scene belonged to the pin@@ ew@@ ood .
who attracts , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub that can complain about noise .
all persons presented only with previous names have been asked to be called by their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le is the contact for integration and organizer .
in addition , she is social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le is the refugee charge for Ur@@ bach .
the social education institution supports the team of managing the Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact for all stakeholders : refugees , work and refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is mis@@ active .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are now more than grateful that Deu@@ ter@@ le is now there , the s@@ hab@@ our W@@ oll@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem above all .
so some - less mo@@ tions than rather on the multitude of desired fields are pur@@ pose@@ ful - meant as the administration wanted to write the place .
was a administrative professional with a talent for languages and people , coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an experience of experience .
but administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le .
it is mainly about organisation , working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network action .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with it for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years with the possibility of extension .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le hon@@ e- and full @-@ time actors are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and minor problems , organizational , human and inter@@ racial problems .
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ p enstraße
a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for the onward connections that have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are in charge of the connection .
you must accomo@@ date the refugees in one &apos;s own or rented rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility is moving from the Land@@ mark Office to commune and job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer its apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de facto the management does not find private apartments .
there are not function@@ alities so far not to be reli@@ ant on private apartments , so Deu@@ ter@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be inf@@ used as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing street .
but only with apartments is it not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , the Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent lo@@ be , it will be tra@@ ine@@ eship , training places , school courts , one @-@ euro @-@ jobs and a helpl@@ ess for refugees and migrants that must be und@@ o@@ und@@ ated or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building or help domestic tasks , do non @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le reported .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
work , however , does not only mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ter@@ le and customer .
the people would have to develop a profound feeling .
so I need offers such as sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers .
it is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time in a meaningful way , for example with language courses .
whoever could develop the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach nobody , should not work and be useless , which will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
problems , however , is also saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people where nothing goes wrong &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ter@@ le and customer is therefore always happy to motivate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : have the two most recent incidents , fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher may call na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a remainder risk can and wants to close it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed the hel@@ pers are already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would have the fear that the attacks are made entirely in recall .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with this , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main - and volunteers must be guided on site and in the region to activities .
they are always in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly the policy .
actually it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le .
no new refugees , which would relax the location .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is also already util@@ ised for the previous person to reasonable .
this is currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : sailors with helicop@@ ters looking for
the police helicopter flew around one hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are hoo@@ ked on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.m. to an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and hit the oun@@ cement of the escape .
the two men were approximately 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mass@@ aged , bore both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis .
they set up the city center .
on the inauguration , the police introduced several strikes , as well as a police helicopter .
the flag@@ ging ran out without success .
perhaps the unknown was in fact close to the apartment or on their flight .
