<seg id="1">Golfers Langer gets the sport pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variety with a ride out on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses were reminded of their evening, they jailed in the fast Gallop to the feed place.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometer at this tempo, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was best golfers of all times - 101 tournament cages - once again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He allowed himself to lead himself to his family about the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he swam not even for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen, and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe handed over to the man from Anhausen in the framework of a small gala, the Goldene Sportum.</seg>
<seg id="15">In awards it lacks the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesseductors, silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already honed him.</seg>

<seg id="21">For decades Langer supports the offspring.</seg>

<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen were on Saturday after Aachen.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Policy in comparison: IT's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - this is both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential guard are on the tax and energy policy as well as in a keynote." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warning about how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulatory requirements.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to assert the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he himself would be very different, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively return regulations and it is strong for long-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the contrary, says: the state has certain duties to fulfil, he has disadvantage opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes would increase for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the words that must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost identically.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic competition announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea-wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there may be more internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clear are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build carbon power plants and uplift the coal production in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate change agreement wants to announce.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton in contrast will specifically extend the renewable energies with its investment programme," "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want we are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements the two rivals are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade deal, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time both, however, both want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The people should then also be better paid, calls for some Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand there is Trump that wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him before, so that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton stands at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight months of long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin gets his Turkish counterplayer in the ilded hall of St. Peter's Palace, I cannot repel the intruder that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the envelope, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile had a malignant and he hardly radiated heat, even for its back-lasting relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report of all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day it described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so would never be a bit worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed more likely to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cool showed that the President of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was sore.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara, Russia fell in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The understanding was even bigger, since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The crauts rebuild again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media introduced a violent attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">It seemed that the Turks seemed to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the serious test, the accusations of leadership officers who have benefitted their own family from illegal oil trading in Syria's Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the debt forgiveness from the president he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends he can get after spending the last month at a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attack on Turkey also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a late season of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television was predicted cheap, fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imported goods are allowed to be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formed the following:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry to the West since its reaction to which was trying to take a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "for this, the continued resentment will come across the Snow Council's accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to benefit from the cool mood and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader won in Ankara with security to win a bonus that he seeks after a coup d "état support for the selected government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-known for Moscow is a matter of course that even a deepest fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one as it was once described as a analyst once described, "Alliance of foreign lands": two countries who violate from the West and feel badly and now stand up.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nonetheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as the peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after nearly three hours of first talks on the press conference, they said that they had not even striped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey proved it deliberately to answer a question about their differences while Putin chose to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potentials for a perfect Disaster, as NATO member Turkey declining the Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other.</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I say now that we do not pursue any global goals, but will pursue local goals." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different, and our employees will work among these brands with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that there will be six Nations sponsoring no longer and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in his sports sponsoring.</seg>

<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical for three years if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these marks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia Putin damp staff leader Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has released unexpectedly his staff of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the narroster of trust by Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, Putin is stating that Putin without giving reasons" "" "the dismissal of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential office." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a proxy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diploma.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his conclusion on the prestigious Staatlichen Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website (in Russian) it says (in Russian) that he was later the director and the director of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "about his appointment he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of legislative and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "this step has turned Moscow mysterious." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest associates of Vladimir Putin and works like he worked for Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As staff leader he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that staff will return to their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is what nobody knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was touted as a potential president, would once again lead Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation, gave me this very complex job - you could almost say - complainable post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been president of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov participated the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin former member of the State Security Council KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the federal security service (FSB), who was appointed KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin got to power he named Ivanov as one of five people whom he most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term in term, as a third presidential term Putin would violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, closer ally putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge is at their place and the last section of the Decks gets today in Rosyth a beta-shot for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness which is worth</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child can no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to rigid on screens, has been complained in the last decade from many.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go, it is about getting people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then limited to video games and finally on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later created by a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture the interest in the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand that overthrew the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users as ink and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their smart phones go outside and search for Pokémons that are prosecuted with a GPS and once they were found once, "photographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "captured" can be captured.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was even younger, joined the Wahn and jumped in for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps which refutes the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, covering 35.000 users, divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed, each day 30 minutes exercising, from 45 percent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data on performance enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to bring people" "" "to take about 30 minutes" "", "" "" "to come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "to be active every day, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overassessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who drives regularly sports is reducing its chances to become ill in cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join hunting even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are too little corrupted toys, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I say?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps were able to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fail with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemons success there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activations in the real world and helping many people on hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I am at the front of the Women's Olympics and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been part of the summer olympic since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the catholic licles, round, makes every pride.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female Turnerinside an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympians and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness of the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected, but masterly Gymastical routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, which won in an individual multi-camp event for women gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnasons throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all smote the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "last Five" "", "because the next Olympics will only have four turbines in the team. also, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like Turnen is a dearer sport and turtles can be maintained primarily in private turnouts which are maintained by parents responsible for training, furnishing, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their turers and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of this turnaround lie in affluent suburbs to support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these days, the gymnasts get their whole training and that is a more expensive and long-term engagement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, instructor by Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes, since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired to the congregations with countless, young girls, which are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a high-serving and easier access trainers.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my turntable of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events we have offered free and affordable krones in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, offering the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turtles develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long advantages for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who are thousands of young girls to care for the tower and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Dutch team of the Olympic team and thank you, Fass will motivate you so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes through acceptance of a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistant doctors, who voted against a vote, rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt plans were unveiled to introduce the contract, and said that the NHS was reduced in a 'no-country' and any further delay on the employees and patients would be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first hospitals are to receive a new contract, which contains changes to night-night and weekly contributions to improve the maintenance of different movements.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "Dr Ellen McCourt, the president of the BMA Combinaries shared last night in a communication with:" "" "Assistance practitioners have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will appeal to the current staff and to treat all doctors" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks that remain still, until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts from BMA to solve the dispute through talks with government on reluctance to take part and sometimes on a deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="13">The BMA wants to be a better weektitude for the 54,000 assistant who are subject to the contract.</seg>

<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of NICE Public Health Sciences Research: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all individuals suffered a heart attack, a further heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>

<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with aspirin effectively in reducing other heart attack and strokes with people who already had a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make him safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Verbanden in New York to find out how to handle armed predators on distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach yourself from the front or from the rear, this video will show you how you turn to your incense.</seg>
<seg id="5">If one is closer to you from the back then you should turn around as a base, so that you can see your attacker and move "out of the walnut," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon then between your front and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then strike it with the knee into the box and rotate, while the attacker fights against pain, the weapon from his hands. strike it with the run into the face and move backwards as they set the gun on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">In attackers that approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the loader line, grab the weapon and rotate it, so that the aggressor cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight over the gun at the same time and hit the attacker to the chest, then rotate the gun out of its grip before they move backwards and establish the gun on it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who is buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you take the comment to comment on it under the pseudonym of non-Allegrmen's age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multidimensional reconstruction of Schallplatten is not attributable to a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are of all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time to spend (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy road in Soho, a modest turkey, and wild, before I steal, my hands hold and somewhat blurb like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart doesn't eat slowly in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling out the buildings where independent sellers are located - there are still a handful of fantastic plate specialist stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera to the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and temperament.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men aged men) into the Recess Records (data number: eight men middle ages), a woman, probably around the 20) is a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">This LP, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I am not sent to it home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why it has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as they appeared and once again buy objects which he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70ies which was published when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates, rather introverted and like to spend your own time, and adds: "I smokes not and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback, and set up to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually have relieved of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to get back to their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the plate grounds of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers participated in the contact-contact payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted Schallplattends, from objects, the happy jewels.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be a filling of a void or the possession of material possessions, as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the collectors I think so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to be mentally engaged.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "flattends a staff of a turnouts." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet been listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the message I would probably look very worried, while I turned aside through a stack of malisa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle ages) has worked, has noticed a "trophy" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radio head record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicous.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come until slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fovernight, which has devoted to the sound panels almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go out.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women aged aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops, Wild Beasts new thesizers and sexcpacked pop instead of experimental jazz blend from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them sees sonoily enough, but wet mental traumas are hard to set if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around for a few minutes and looked at the variation of the plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shockpee as a large one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, hence the gathering of plates isn't real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives with a loved sigh off.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it truly is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record owners: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I give the semblance to mured jeans hotspots, I watch a group of young teenagers, grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering to buy a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees her - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some as far as it is impossible to grasp them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could make more money for the industry and could send some customers in the depths of sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they do, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female gatherers and records who exist in reality, record stores and in online foren.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">You will spend their Thursday tomorrow with security not by bike rides from Berwick Street and leaves through sheets, while watching the rigid eye of an uncanny, 30-year false moderator, who climbs over the shoulders of nothing of the men's middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er Rugby came in the finals on Thursday evening to a abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the devic stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji has given a master class in handling, side-Stepping, retrospect, line run and crude strength to win gold - its first olympic waist of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was captured by the not too bad TrostPrize from the silver medal - Great Britain fourth on this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The sharp defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to it in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of each other, Fiji on this form would have been beaten a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be for UK a consolation - but will probably not - that at least a Brite will have a gold medal at his neck: Fijis Chefcoach Ben Ryan, the former chief for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan of each game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, they lost just one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This scap is going to do, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful, leaving the attacks of GBs out of fun Abplallen.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on, as if one would run in travel buses. the World Series-winner went to 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau moved in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai still added another attack from the right corner, which he changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely installed the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hot tistical tick from Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third goal: but it has encountered Fiji only.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right turn is a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for UK.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the rectiff and there was still a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prescries through further weak Tablings of the GB team and run down to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought an 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while Britain still continues to read.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fidelian gap... for quite four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, to Joshua Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started making an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was running long in favor of southern overseas sulphans, whose fans saddling and danced at the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i-icing on a further trial in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff catered, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked off in the turf.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day, Fiji in Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 defeats and the UK forced South Africa in a scarce semi-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's conversion of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boat in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive footwork and scored one gate below the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside teams, secured the gain - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing.</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotinaleres gold than in these games, and that is what they want.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment on the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the confers who were sitting at the boat, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent than her to the second Olympic-old in two without tax-wife in a row, the first women in the history of British sports that placed such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39,ter unwelded use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete who glide on the surface with the elegance of sponges, which is not reflecting the kind of triggering.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the Ruins, a battalion of willing helpers contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no one assistant than the coach who would not even survive this day at all when diagnosed with him cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had blisters, the operable and that did them.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads throughout.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little to the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, could begin to keep the break down to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the invincibility of victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who spent a nerve racer morning so doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning which was as Hauptmann at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that might be something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much me this means, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have a better person to carry out or wish a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark signed, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "Stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>

<seg id="6">Because Singen is right from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describe Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can establish social contacts and cultivate them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures in old age solve a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>

<seg id="19">In singing the head is also required to have a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone so do not just concentrate on themselves.</seg>

<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem is growing by the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show himself: if I am long for something, I will get better and alert about myself - this experience reinforces.</seg>

<seg id="9">They asked if this repeated controversy on a larger problem was that the company with diversity has.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat mittent that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that won the American with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember to have ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">That knows, however, the Americanism are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition, and are equal in their group with the Britons on the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will join the last round of the first round on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will gain the first and second place in each group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The initial board is going to make a little longer the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, American people have sparked a surprising vortex, four years after they landed on the last London games at the last of 12 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey sleeping in hands (their two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became nationalists of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">It missed the Olympiad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the cadres.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday night Bam opened the scorches in the first half of the game with a backhand from the seam area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone out into play without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the playing field from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are incapable of developing and inescapable, a rapid tour of competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the olympic facket itself would be a burning rod, which is operated by the bracelet for the swimmers to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Leading or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is part of the Olympic Games for the first time at the Olympic Games and would be quite under this known name, which would have been sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well-being-TV advertisement, if he would be a swimmers, turner or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not illuminated every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chestnut and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I might make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me direct the attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline already jump since 2000 an Olympic event, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years was so sparse noticed that many people I asked, did not know that it is a Olympiasportart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US has sent athletes to competitions, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had made an athlete until 2012, who made it up to the final.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on a trampoline has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unresolved ear for a clownsschool as the Olympic Games that will sound for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a erated enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never ending wolds - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports which are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means so much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, lifting and salads) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to official Olympiad by execution, levels of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are competing in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medaillenhofftes must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and penetrated, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not only chase the ziellinie or the output wall, but in the television transfer also another height: that of the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think of doing this games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">This offers the trampoline a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forwards movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she pruned, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes to the top, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wölben in the distance, just the dreamy, elegant removal of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition with the Olympic Games can be only.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Qualification and Endrunden the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will beaming the Endrunden as part of a follow-up at both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can be achieved only by the anxiety and the lenses of male athletes - like the male US Turner before the The Wall Street Journal, Mr Dooley expects his air to rinse, new fanatics.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested in Ethiopia, Long ne ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters that demand political changes in Ethiopia for violent resistance by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesters have been killed during clashes with the police in swusssion.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia really to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years it has been one of Africa's stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months the protests against the government were destroyed in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was imcharitable to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot at least unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moving around the protests that probably come from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN Security Council for Human Rights now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep up this country and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at the remarkable tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved, there is a new pendant in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations constantly continued the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereas the dissidents were silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or sent to prison, were killed or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you press people and do not have any other option except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground-use until the stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition, and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tension is rising along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogades, which were forced over the last years more or less, the turmoil will benefit and get armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitors are now exploding under the surface under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media as cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are at regular intervals, especially with protests, many people can still communicate via internet-proxies, which conceal, where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they gathered so much protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since ages prospered the Amharas, who come from aedics, mainly Christian arrogance countries, in politics and the economy, while they are the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But also this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in secret services, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, one former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years in Ethiopian prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in it, to perceive early signs of discontent and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict-analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unattended reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came out of the Tigray region of northern Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of controlled security services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia lived such a turmoil was 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to the indications of analytic seemingly fueled by the government and subsequently were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following sweeps, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts in Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new pendant train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic town, of Tigray guided businesses and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests and other Western allies bring their allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighbouring Somalia, even though they recently knew that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West definitely wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally interrupting its allies in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump has declared his claim Obama with ISIS be "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to allay the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated contention, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarifications cast new questions on the communication skills of the presidential election of the republicans whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his collaborators, who strive to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain to the peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really was not intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarkastical.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was opposed to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Being the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement by letting him recalled that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the republican presidential election did not know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The final storm of the criticisms of Mr. Trump came down, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to decaying envelope.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton concluded speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinics would lead to higher taxes and that he would have found their talk boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has succeeded in defending sarcasm to its defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism in himself, when he argued, the Russians were to bake Mrs. Clintons Eemails, but later he later "Of course I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the language boundaries in politics and then to recede when needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans, how they arrive, and then if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." Ruth Sherman, a communications expert observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is very clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of resolute the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even reckless sound, since its refractional values continue to come back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a guided tour with great advantage in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally tempted to not apologise for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or misunderstanding his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes have brought his loyal co-stripe into the imcomfortable situation, to him no matter how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, gave great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans attempt to argue that the government under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton served as an outministering, it seems to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once hardened by the price of the market, café in Greenpoint comes back</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shabitation café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay Wi-Fi, but for 15 years it was a good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront was pushed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The store Soap Cherie that put it in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Native people over the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabuses wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York change is, then it is also new.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working with Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When he offered a customer to provide funds for a new outside, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept much with.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are shellations such as capers and sucked onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural food-bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café does not serve beer anymore, there are fresh juice.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez told that he noticed a new stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in Williamsburg and visited the Verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she was drawn to Greenpoint, she would take the way.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave a while the coffee table, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "I realized that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that fell down," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she has coffee again, even if they ordered a Blended coffee table in this day instead of their usual Iced coffee, a blended Chai tea store, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long-term and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and ordered invariably the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came back to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket clock, and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and make new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays, Rosenthal gets still his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he does not have a Groll about that the soap business has taken up the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Chery to produce a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the coffee as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go back to their offer," said Rodriguez.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional, Polish inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he preferred to put them back soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has its advantages.</seg>

<seg id="39">He was lovely unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake when not his wife Eleanor had asked him to statuate a stamp with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book the squad introduced a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosevelt, that the White House brought the boring food in Washington but also one of the most comforted food prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, deal with food was rejected once the land came back on the legs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest fluiditier is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland usually come to surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">The shark was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board the sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to date.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland can only get offspring with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely snudes the Greenland shark at the bottom of the northern Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to arrives, the five meters long animal speeds up to 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this of long-term lifestyle seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at least one Greenland who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock these life-span, which means a world-chord for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist already suspected that Greenland are stony old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacking the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland are difficult to watch, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they mostly appear in the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland researchers too little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time-pentago measures them when they recompromised six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make these sharks still: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robe, another had slucked the jaw of a young icbear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly chase them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice mezzling and looking for carcasses, that torates from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now explored 28 Greenlanda, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimeter.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the Linsenker of Haie with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eyelet is already developed before the birth of the sharks, which contain them contained in it later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the liners.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons, try to sluggish large amounts of this radiant carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of the smallest animal-14 inches in the length of the smallest animal, the linsenis against the nuclear weapon-14 out of the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland in their litter on the other hand had normal carbon-14 volumes, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-14-clock showed an age of 335 centimeters long Greenland an old of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters can be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenlandhai-female will only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers were able to assign the length of an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters are probably on the brink of sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Grönlandhaie is obviously at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenlandwal, in whose bacon on the neck a 120 year old Harpoon top, was captured on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures often the organism of the animals living there are also spared animals.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm water warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal is heating.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram Elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very big animal should invest his resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate-odell.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if the Venus with its hot, water-tight surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have been reformed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow derotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, similar atmosphere could have had, and nevertheless slowly revolved.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminates the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to live life and protect life more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation exponizes the slow transformation of Venus its daily side of the sun for almost two months," stated GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds, which acts as a rain-screen to shield the surface from a large portion of the sunning.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that have some degree more cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that has previously been suspected by planetary research.</seg>

<seg id="15">Her Oceans darker and their water vapor was burned down by the ultra-violet light.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide erpressen hackers broke their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of pressmalware are currently taking part targeted companies - and are successful in this.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of Malware's specialists in Malwarebytes, under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies surveyed over the past twelve months at least once, partially repeated victims of a attack with blackout software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany nearly 20 percent of companies have already been the aim of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid willingly the solder demanded by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackout software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential tyransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of harm software," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleccynski in conversation with the "" "" World "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malwareprogrammes were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only there were private purposes, but the change to company attacks was terrifying rapidly in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware currently works on a simple pattern: once on the computer of an option, it looks for long-long changed files such as Wordpress, Excel- or database files as well as the archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the blackout.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final decrypting code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryptowages Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where with private users, the personal photo database is on the game, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ransomware proposes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German firms involved in sales loss by ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break the business completely, in case of a case people were in life of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hundred hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims always: pays off, but it only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure the commercial areas and the contact with blackout agents are examined and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims by chat on how they can pay per Bitcoin, set free access sites or encode for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And shall individuals redeemed by payments of a few hundredths of Euros, companies must negotiate a bit hard and pay five-digit sums in order to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail the hackers are getting professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software construction to the actual blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous Malware kits were created by the Malware themselves, advising and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackheads are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We are living in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums in the underground, buying the set of a criminal and asked another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per inapproved calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually, the criminals then carry spammer with the spread" "", "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Ransomware's risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that provide their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust in order to repel Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">By doing so, the damage, depending on the type of data is still much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take entirely new goals on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated security researchers, how they could get used with the Internet to obtain thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the boldness of such a blocking heating could be quite a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be a theme in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you come around for ever, at night you are awake hours awake, in the morning is already far before the cheeckeringling no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Anyhow, one with such problems is in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of the adults's adult disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or ingestion?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there can be diverse causes underlying them, stressing Hans-Günter Wemolded, board member of the German Society for Sleeving Research and Sleeving Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you can see beneath it, but is the insomnia, so one inhalation and sleeptive disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Right now, many people experience as unsatisfying or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Board member in the German Building association with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is there to sleep?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of ingestion are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can organic, mental or maladjusted factors, but also medicines are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleeping-disorder expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking up is mostly common in depression," "" "says Wemolded." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors are oppressive.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who for example has a slipped disk can lie bad, is waking up every two to three hours and starts eager to salute about everyday problems and worry, there is Wemolding an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one be with sleeves to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who for over a period of one month in at least three nights per week is not well sleeps and the day is compromised, should go to the doctor, betray white.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look completely different: one is beaten, tired, unexhausted, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical grievances such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the filtering, it is important to figure out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, among other things behaviour changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medicines - classic bedclothes are only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - indemand.</seg>
<seg id="22">Low-trained sleeping Medical Diagnosis in Germany hardly, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should turn to sleep problems first at first to the doctor, betraying Wemolt.</seg>
<seg id="24">The can be clear with investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in the sleeping labor medicine he rates for example in snoring with respiratory diseases, in sleeping-life-fatigue, for sleeping-like, or if one does not find the cause of a sleeptive disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">Actually, you do not have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After wiring, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap, and a antennae by the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also, a camera on the blanket draws the bedside.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can the problems be able to handle the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of wheelchairs where you can put on a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">White-molded counts: regular bed- and lifts, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV, alcohol, and at night not wait for the watch - then one begins to reckon immediately, and this is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July and were collaborative, workspace and particularly professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists in the CID-Commissariat 34 can have entered the thieves, which they had entered to the oppression of criminal offences to Germany, four actions.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the process they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lenses, in between the rest of the rest of the head: the Riga-Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain appears at first glance, but the police force them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from east to west, one passes on game places, a freshman nursery and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a gray house someone has "ugly!" anointed. "</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl who will soon be demolished, is already built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new flats for rent.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" trendy "" trendy city "" "," as the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls, but in recent weeks it will be prefered with burning cars. "" "</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants of rental contracts, on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, Henkel had repeatedly called for a hard action of the police against the project, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After June 22nd, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officials, according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, spersed parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later moved police and builders under the jubel of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">At this summer afternoon the road works peaceful: parents go walking with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking to vores Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main names of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiev since 1999 and Jana *, who raise three children here, are primarily generalized by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern against increasing tenant and ventrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a pjz who wish for a majority of Polizeischutz on the left of vandalion left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, that of the Berlin interior and the police between homeers and their neighbors, does not exist, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain im East Berlins was actually a traditional working-class district, which also has a low average of poverty today compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also, housekeeping and the native projects have long been part of the fortiz: in 1990 numerous homes have been occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire motherhood street very near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police station, many of the projects in Riga have been legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the part of the city has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: they now share the inhabitants of GDR-times and former imperial occupied their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents that have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one realizes them in a sleeped slices, or freshly shaded façades, which were rejected with colours.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason is that not all neighbours might consider that as a problem, it could not necessarily be affected by crime: criminal offences such as bodily injury, according to policemen, are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the criminal offences make assessments that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there cannot be any talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: people in 94 are their neighbours that have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars give it right in the Rigs for no longer any longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga Street and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was also important for her to get back their street: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of Beds, as the Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by sighted new buildings in former buildings that push the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately property apartments, which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I absolutely not share." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if one never hears someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There are frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For those drawn out about colour bombs, Kerstin has little understanding: the houseprojects and the left scene belonged to the pinewood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who attracts, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub that can complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with previous names have been asked to be called by their correct name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuterle is the contact for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuterle is the refugee charge for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social education institution supports the team of managing the Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all stakeholders: refugees, work and refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is misactive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are now more than grateful that Deuterle is now there, the shabour Wollchsau, who has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less motions than rather on the multitude of desired fields are purposeful - meant as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Was a administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an experience of experience.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is mainly about organisation, working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network action.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with it for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years with the possibility of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuterle hone- and full-time actors are supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and minor problems, organizational, human and interracial problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasp enstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for the onward connections that have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are in charge of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accomodate the refugees in one's own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is moving from the Landmark Office to commune and job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the management does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are not functionalities so far not to be reliant on private apartments, so Deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be infused as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing street.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is it not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, the Regine customer and Annika Deuterle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent lobe, it will be traineeship, training places, school courts, one-euro-jobs and a helpless for refugees and migrants that must be undoundated or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building or help domestic tasks, do non-profit work - and this motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuterle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Work, however, does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuterle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a profound feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time in a meaningful way, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever could develop the feeling that he could not help in Urbach nobody, should not work and be useless, which will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problems, however, is also saying, "" "" people where nothing goes wrong "" "." the work of Deuterle and customer is therefore always happy to motivate others. "" "</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two most recent incidents, fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "" "no," "" "says Regine customer clearly clearly," "" "what mancher may call naïve" "". "a remainder risk can and wants to close it out." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized the helpers are already.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks are made entirely in recall.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main - and volunteers must be guided on site and in the region to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, which would relax the location.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is also already utilised for the previous person to reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
