Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Teheran &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but it is also intended to meet the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington un@@ ra@@ zed the ongoing settlement of Israel and thro@@ ws a lack of lack in the peace process .
through the Obama &apos;s reaction to the Iranian nuclear programme , the relation of the two was further deterior@@ ated .
in March , Netanyahu announced a controversial speech to the invitation of Re@@ public@@ ans before the US Congress , which was signed partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not talked with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election of the im@@ min@@ ent election in Israel .
in a not@@ ary said Professor , shot his girlfriend
in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon filed with a somewhat delicate voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and had to come to his house .
he was so important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still living and probably excited was , and he said the family contacted of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house he found officials of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and an hand@@ written note : I wanted to do it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that he had traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , but had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed , according to the police , an popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ zi@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said he did then after a fatal emergency .
by the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police em@@ bos@@ sed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what he motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff they knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were happy about their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a written book , he was mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both included in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose educational body includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some dis@@ likes to be problematic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Jehovah , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something had wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
he had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had some sort of health problem .
this year he set up only two online courses .
recent changes in employment policies of the university meant that the promotion , for the Lamb for he had worked so hard , for him no guarantee for an automatic way to act as assistant professor would represent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said William La@@ For@@ ge , he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something with Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that he is no longer able to answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police were later sl@@ ated by the Lam@@ bs lane , when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as import .
before he could be arrested , he was ra@@ ged himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ols in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still going on in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why we went to this house , but Johnson said that she thinks he knew people who lived there .
he grew up in the area .
he started his work at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and promoted geography and pedago@@ gy .
he received his doc@@ torate in the spring of Pa@@ ed@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs attacked him as an intelligent , charis@@ matic and mer@@ ry .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
he was then the women &apos;s flock .
all girls sh@@ ook to it when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ ban of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously given some time together .
in the post@@ pon@@ ement , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house built on a bass player in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband by Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , she died 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and a daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos; Ste@@ en said , he never met him , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and was playing blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ er , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail emerged both in a summer year@@ market three years ago .
later they played together one way or another .
o &apos; Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse responsible for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a qu@@ ark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes check@@ ered bar at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s walked and Pr@@ enti@@ er Night in the night 5 . September for the last time he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic harmon@@ ica and finished in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was not agreed .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the lifts and have each other with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote Professor , directed the former semester seminar and specialized in American natives and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell said , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of its Brotherhood and the Stu@@ dents .
on the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including faculty , employees , students and members of the community participating in a cand@@ l@@ elight memorial .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts woman Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mah@@ n@@ ace , while the university kno@@ ck@@ or &apos; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing Grace &quot; sang .
classes will be added on Wednesday again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans carried to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police said now that he made the emergency , after he had he@@ c Schmidt and that the lamb was reported in his notebook as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plan to set up less man@@ power for the holiday season

Michael J. Fox , his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the Theater at the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is left to me and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to my mind that I am a simul@@ ated m@@ ower and a boun@@ ce away from it , with the princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time &quot; , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ ah Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had premiere over 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed one of the greatest time voyage film that was ever turned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

UN chief says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russian military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of continuous conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen force and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader again calls for all parties , including the UN Security Council to unite and support an inclusive process in finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Secretary of State of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the Secretary General Meeting to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts the dis@@ closing in the Council and within the Syrian People and of the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; render this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 re@@ frac@@ tures that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to draw Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks to the surveys using surveys using it ( still ) does not work .
ten of the last eleven national pol@@ ls showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to ask some serious about what it means for chances of nom@@ ination of Real Estate Mo@@ gul@@ p .
it is of course still too early in the election period .
none claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts acc@@ entu@@ ate that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership has been handed over to the rising Herman Cain , of which no one has ever won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to struggle in a general election .
but outdoor side @-@ groups like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognis@@ ing turbul@@ ence and begin to let their dollars flow in order to overthrow it .
here are some current survey participants that suggest that Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary period :
Tru@@ mp@@ s exposure values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans seen real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 per cent .
now , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative attitude .
and these figures remain in early countries .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ al Survey in Iowa last week discovered that 60 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week 67 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans , they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just two of 10 say , they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 per cent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 per cent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that &quot; dis@@ cont@@ ented &quot; or &quot; mad &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite , the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would be a candidate .
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish re@@ public@@ ans believe that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first act of the nation , the federal state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for an Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ Nig@@ erian last week .
still , 44 % remember that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his ministry , and almost six of 10 Independent , that his temper@@ ament did not match the White House , so ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they set up their scholar@@ ship , can hold Republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who most likely the GO@@ P Nom@@ ination wins , say after a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from the last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four out of ten broke their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters didn &apos;t have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that stage in the last cycle consisted of four of ten re@@ public@@ ans that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to just 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters can be seen as plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp suggests almost everybody .
some experts suggest that the breaking @-@ up field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other nom@@ inate .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is fighting for multi @-@ health support .
he faces C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans says they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half the vot@@ er people support the Tru@@ mp show that they have awarded their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never to change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s are the strongest competitors in the moment the other out@@ sider , neuro@@ surgeon , Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp in the subject of immigration .
since then , Donald Tru@@ mp was named &quot; rape ist in his election campaign two months ago from Mexico , &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum at the public discourse in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expressions of Tru@@ mp are crucial H@@ isp@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damaged the re@@ vocation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but following the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp in case of the question of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp is apparently going to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frustration of the government is climbing to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , nearly half of the support for Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ sider voters .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday survey conducted by ABC @-@ Mail , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 % &quot; aw@@ fully . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive co@@ exclusive of Germany
here is the most expensive living complex - with a view over the North Sea .
on the street it costs an square meter of a single @-@ roof house at the average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , meaning it says in the study , thus the high price .
one new study reveals in which special La@@ gen one square meter is the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square metres for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really low .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ residential towns , one of the price is like pe@@ anu@@ ts .
the Real Estate provider Engel &amp; multi@@ player has published a ranking of the exclusive German residential area - with square me@@ tering prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros : one square meter , well @-@ marked .

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Traum@@ launch thanks to Müller and Go@@ tz@@ e
doubt Tor@@ protective e in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
an au@@ sp@@ icious sign of Thomas Müller served to FC Bayern the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympic med@@ os Piraeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Go@@ tz@@ e have attacked the FC Bayern in the Wit@@ enk@@ es@@ sel of Piraeus a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their performance game in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ dol play@@ es ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth for success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28th 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to take the exec@@ ut@@ pot@@ t in Munich for the third attempt .
Müller was awarded in his 28 debut in the Champions League for the Bayern &apos;s leadership of the 2008 champi@@ ons of Olympi@@ ac@@ os go@@ alie Roberto , who allowed a head @-@ out shot of the world &apos;s head .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; had promised Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game at the Car@@ ri@@ k@@ akis @-@ Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ flowers fans - and the Mün@@ chner voted word .
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without having to shine .
Piraeus had gained his youngest six @-@ games in the top class , among them well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 proud also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Du@@ cks with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went grace@@ fully , with their aggressive efforts , but often to inv@@ it@@ less to work .
the attacks were often initiated by hand@@ picked on Lin@@ ks@@ berg Douglas Costa , who rarely passed through the former Braunschweig region El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had better luck from the right than his flan@@ k taken from the right half @-@ field in the left upper rect@@ angle .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ k@@ owski .
initially , as the Olympi@@ as of the Olympi@@ as Ide@@ ally Cre@@ ye Brown made the head of the Poles down the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct removal , the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bayern dominated her usual game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to put Piraeus .
on Tor@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was a leave .
for example , when he sent a shot by idea about the le@@ aps ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four qu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that he did well .
Mario Go@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back at the ca@@ des , sat out initially .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave a green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matthias Sam@@ mer said at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that is quite peculiar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during his first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he got to King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Lew@@ v@@ ks@@ um Lew@@ k@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and placed 13 minutes later everything clearly , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller placed an eye on the road .
in front of the game , it was at the Stadium to Kra@@ w@@ at .
after a smaller group of partly vers@@ ed Bavaria fans in their audience @-@ block evi@@ dently had prov@@ oked the adher@@ ents of hosts Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , attacked the security forces and went up with vines to the Mün@@ chner adher@@ ents .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk , teeth to lose
whoever smo@@ kes , therefore not only the lungs but also the teeth - this puts a central Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : in comparison the risk is quick .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to po@@ king the risk , losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely to lose the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists had watched more than 23@@ 300 atten@@ de@@ es .
root causes of tooth loss , tooth decay and inflammation of the gear , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , acc@@ entu@@ ate the authors .
the connection between cigarette smoking and tooth@@ loss now go back to common g@@ um inflammation in smokers .
do not clarify what extent smoking is also increasing the risk of dental c@@ aries .
people who listened with smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the threat again to the level of es@@ po@@ ke , the du@@ sty Thomas Diet@@ rich explained by the English University Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be said to convince people that are non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the university manager H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is reducing the lifetime &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings , even to a good dental health up to the tall age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of people aged 65 to 74 have been affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E ans themselves .
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking is raising the risk of failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ ere the findings .

European Commission propos@@ ing a new trial in dispute
to re @-@ raise the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the European Commission has proposed extensive reform of the current arbitration system .
the disputed private arbitration equipment for disputes between companies and states is therefore intended to be solved by a more transparent system , which in its way corresponds with significantly more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that helps citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the relevant EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish has decided to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TTIP must create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbitration procedures fores@@ ee@@ able that the EU and US have jointly chosen independent judges for a new investment .
they are supposed to come to equal parts from the EU , the U.S. and third countries .
this is the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ g@@ ments .
so far the methods involved have agreed among themselves as a refer@@ ee , an objection to their judgment , there was not .
in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and fairness , Malm@@ ström had registered .
in the long run , she wants to work according to an International investment court .
this example could also be clarified in disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries .
most notably of major corporations called investor @-@ state arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbitration actions are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ judicial system , on the firms har@@ ming pollut@@ ants from tax payers , national laws and cover a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in first statements by anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act , the proposals of the European Commission were considered insufficient .
it was critici@@ zed especially that it is not intended for the already negotiated trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Ber@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , drew the plans to be a huge progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission participated in the reform essential points , Federal Minister for Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel was put out in the spring with other EU @-@ trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbitration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .

the European Union of B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned that the accus@@ ations of the economy by too many new rules .

when the discussions about the TTIP free trade agreement ( Transatlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
originally a framework for the agreement was already at the end of this year .
this appointment is regarded as no longer sustainable .
Deli@@ vering Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .

Jeremy Cor@@ bi@@ er debut in the round @-@ round of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ bi@@ er debut has been awaited by the Prime Minister with excitement on the question of the Prime Minister .
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut in the Prime @-@ Minister &apos;s cargo minister and opening up with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to post the first of his six given questions shortly after mid@@ day , where his performance is likely to be checked by the media and by the Labour MPs from the close .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; on this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabin and after his speech at TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the decision of the Labour President , on Tuesday during the singing of the National hy@@ m@@ ne has prov@@ oked during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several front pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ bying &apos;s decision , not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in respect of silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n lou@@ ver , O@@ wen Smith , told in BBC Two news program , he told the Labour leader to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n leaders , and they were called to differences in business , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leaders .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also in the Labour &quot; St@@ ay &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n statements about the European Union &apos;s position and the limit of wins .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference to put the Labour amendments to complete the whole idea of a bo@@ unds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith said Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work@@ - and pensions decision that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they were only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , by David Cameron , since he is the T@@ ory Chef , in the last decade of the debate on the Disp@@ atch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he had &quot; crow@@ ned @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions on Mr Cameron and gave it more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the gri@@ ps of the Prime @-@ Ministry is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is committed to sc@@ rub with re@@ vocation , and instead it has done to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , who is in charge of the shadow of economics , if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is on the move abroad .
he has also brought the idea to talk that other colleagues on occasionally seize the word and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , addressed to discuss the problem .
when he became the leader of 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wants to move from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; which is often linked with the prime minister . but a few years later he adm@@ its that he has failed to do so .
since it was broadcast@@ ed in television first in 1990 , the questionnaire was seen with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling and his position in the House of Commons and his position under his parliament@@ arians , though critics did have argued that it has become a caric@@ ature and a substantial reform .

pounds rise to accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
the pound has risen sharp@@ ly after data , showing an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 has been increased through the SA@@ BM@@ iller target in parallel .
between May and July the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the quick@@ est and received entries over the time of a interest rate since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed an increase by 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a leap from 20 % after the assumption of the ri@@ val AB in@@ Be@@ v was received .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and combine brands like Bud@@ dies , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry @-@ shares were higher according to encouraging news from the competition @-@ group for luxury goods ri@@ cher 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ a &apos;s newest sales figures increase all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - growth again .
stocks of Glen@@ core rose by 5 % after the mining race said that it took 2,5 billion $ through a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper@@ work MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , while using a decrease of 4.@@ 3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment of rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % after the Sport@@ cle@@ at company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill said that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more sales force in the pockets of the potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that such merchants become the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean less additional jobs .

not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied the Justin yesterday .

P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster leads to the Kartoff@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er @-@ Ide@@ as
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and true in the Kartoff@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er , who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger food owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; Pot@@ ato , &quot; D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ hay Kar@@ to@@ alo and meat has put together on a sp@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him to a poster with a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he happened to be watching television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue is about in its store , that is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ ticul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has now to be put into the patent office in Munich meanwhile at the Patent Office in Munich .
in this respect , it has recently been protected as pre @-@ use pattern since information purposes .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ it contains , Al@@ hay therefore does not reveal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even with his customers , the culinary appreciation was good .
met@@ cash launches ground @-@ speed campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - intru@@ sion
met@@ cash attempts to protect the Ig@@ A branch in front of an al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has started a plan @-@ based campaign in order to defend the market share of the Ig@@ A retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets are expanding their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstream marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
Ig@@ A @-@ traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice @-@ manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , which distri@@ butes in Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop owners , the al@@ illi@@ ed tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected to assume additional details of its defense strategy on 29 September , if the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices will pass its annual Invest@@ ors &quot; strategy .
there is much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia constitute almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ charging , and generate higher profits as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ Network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and Ig@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts as Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di 12 months after opening its first markets will cut away around five per cent of the food market in these two countries , and will take all actors available , but mainly independent single @-@ retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailers must lose 360 million annual revenues per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 .
this prognosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has launched 25 competing in SA and 30 in WA , and generate revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and with the amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs , Met@@ cash could cost about 13 million dollars from interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market share loses in the Eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey conducted by Roy brilli@@ antly found that Ig@@ A @-@ bought buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley particip@@ ates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s generated sales in the food and grocery shop by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.3 percent in 2014 and 2.1 percent in 2014 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent by 2020 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business in Melbourne , told that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has taken contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 per cent since 2010 , and revenues of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s dietary and food outlets , which has about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailers , has been fallen by 43 percent , which is reflected in operating debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on turnover and margins .
the wholes@@ aler tra@@ vers@@ ed however and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ , to increase sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ ites by hundreds of products every week to improve their stores by fast growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label food products .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tations and charging programs to be placed on el@@ an and hopes that the dealer will return for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ son deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and to consider the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ n@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; by the in@@ famous examination of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters into the spotlight .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game , soon after that Kok@@ n@@ akis and his opponent Ryan Harrison was twice separated from the refer@@ ee while Harrison was calling and I was supposed to beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp@@ f failed a potential US Open @-@ win @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ n@@ akis was ste@@ ad@@ fast by He@@ aly .
the teen is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in order to win the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that I hur@@ ting me pretty much , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , as he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et of frustration with himself , and I know it was good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison , and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too severe .
he is a very mature one @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players he trained in the locker area , he is working hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged by his own merits .
He@@ aly also supported the decision that Kyr@@ gios started to take into account the important decision which is on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term steady part of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think he made very quick the rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray observed . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has some very bad mistakes , and we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate for the crew and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency crisis , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary declares the emergency and broke the south@@ ward with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to get illegal in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants were revol@@ ted in a no @-@ country @-@ country and Serbian government who were re@@ acting with indign@@ ation .
the people who were fled by violence st@@ ashed for an unknown period in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents , and settled down there .
but Fru@@ ity rose .
as a police helicopter above them ho@@ vering , the migrants &quot; openings &quot; appe@@ aled the border ! &quot; and rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian poli@@ cem@@ an .
some pointed out of protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that immigrants from Hungary were returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a def@@ ective .
in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries have to be held , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block at a strict meeting in Brussels could not agree in common asylum policy .
however , the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who arrived in the sheltered Italy and Greece . they left their hopes that finally - next month or by the end of the year - a deal was reached that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary set out its hopes for an early opening of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Emer@@ gency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more competences to get out of the crisis , so they could reduce roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country plan to build a st@@ ack@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after reaching a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons in the race , to create bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has been campa@@ igning for many war people from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a substantial bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entrance to the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the upcoming economic migrants are seeking a better life and non @-@ war people who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence , which led the government along the southern border with Serbia , become a crime . these laws continue to place higher pen@@ alties for condemned human merchants .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency , &quot; said Government of Zol@@ tan Kov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press reported on the border armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advisor for Or@@ ban said that authorities need 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penetr@@ ated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaged the fence ; they are now lab@@ elled into police and are accused of the acts of criminal off@@ ences following the new laws .
authorities are going to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials took two of the seven border crossing with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carri@@ ed@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ts the major border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to work on people &apos;s data and press a crowd to push oneself up there .
about 20 failed to reach , but thousands left outside .
another group of migrants marked the most important highway in Serbia and Hungary and said they would deny food and water until they are allowed to go to Hungary .

Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet announced , whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is on which candidates will support them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ t supporters are persistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton had lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders had achieved some profits .
Clinton provides a great advantage with women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have reduced .
your support among the men is significantly decreased , and S@@ anders is only 5 points back here .
there &apos;s a permanent advantage with democratic voters under 50 years of age , and they are now at equal altitude .
Clinton had a great lead in the senior voters .
in the last month , Clinton had changed a two @-@ minute lead in the liber@@ als but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the National elections have said that they were Clinton to support with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would assist them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the nomin@@ ee .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about it .
the views are more mixed with those who Clinton does not support Clinton - only about a quarter would they support enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the preliminary elections suggest that Clinton can support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters do this about its spit@@ zen@@ kan@@ di@@ daten Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 % ) .
if Clin@@ t supporters are asked in an open question why they want it &apos;s nomin@@ at@@ ine , the most common answer is that she is the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
the Clinton &apos;s supporters is also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
prior agreement to dealing with the problems and the constitu@@ encies are also quoted .
because the Vice President puts an potential for the presidential guard to the Wa@@ ag@@ layer , 57 percent of the democratic voters can see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the elections were asked , who for the party would be their second choice is Bi@@ den to the top .
Clin@@ ique Bo@@ ilers say more than half that Bi@@ den their second choice would be far ahead of S@@ anders .
decide Bi@@ den , not for the nomin@@ ee of the Democrats , is Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head ahead of us , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure dropped by 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; number one &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important to candidates , Democratic voters call questions on the elec@@ ability .
similarly as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters can be regarded as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates and potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in voters of the front elections of their party .
maj@@ orities have Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong gu@@ ide@@ alities .
Bi@@ den inter@@ sec@@ ts with the three candidates the best when honesty , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is strength .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 % ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him .
the general elections in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ an@@ ide@@ ologically in agreement with their views .
in all these measurements , about one @-@ quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions of Hill@@ ary Clinton have questions on Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term , most of the Democratic voters of the pre@@ elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions did not influence overall .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only a third is satisfied .
public opinion happened in March , shortly after the problem was light , split .
most of the Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion from her was still worse .
they are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy it is a problem for them among voters a total : 32 % they see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of people entitled to vote do not hold an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters will see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trustworthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are provided with good notes .
of the six tested candidates , Car@@ son and Bush wa@@ its best for honesty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 R@@ elec@@ tors by the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to country next survey close to Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is home to Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s latest survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times .
the two Candi@@ dates back by now half of the support of the voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , in order to 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son falls in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received in demographic groups and in@@ mp under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ sich , died at deepest loved Governor Scott Walker , who fell at the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ Governor J@@ eb Bush , the former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are on third place .
the debu@@ gging affair at the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey conducted last week shows that Car@@ son is increasing in surveys - he lands with 19 % support among re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clear before Car@@ son .
looking to one in the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some ki@@ si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon surgeon , even after Car@@ son exc@@ used to question Tru@@ mp@@ s belief in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
even if top values are measured only in the distance , for bathing flu@@ ff even a trip to the Mediterranean in order to find a warm water .
a dip in the north or Baltic Sea is likely to be a short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some did not go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees keeps the water in the north and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German weather service ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
the bathing temperatures still offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the tip 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood ran@@ ged with the death of a bar@@ gain College no@@ vice
almost two years after a student during a single student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ s were filed against 5 people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta Pla@@ in seized Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during the introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 , and denied his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death rendered to the police .
civil servants said he had been har@@ ra@@ zed with associated eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeated , while he tried to pass over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g didn &apos;t complain about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta firms called not the emergency number 911 , after being impot@@ ent and rep@@ ain@@ ted an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to solic@@ it advice , says Poli@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , members of U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and presented the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in his wounds next morning .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g were repeated with st@@ ump@@ fer energy injury to head , torso and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Ru@@ kan@@ en of the Brotherhood - at least a student dies since 1970 each year on the gun &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ a family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held to account , and this step of authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members due to murder of the third grade .
twenty @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with anti @-@ governmental attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we not only want to blame the persons involved , but once there is an organization - officially or un@@ officially - this is sanc@@ tioned , so we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College established the Brotherhood and the national frat@@ ernity re@@ vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a Zin@@ p increase , and the house@@ se will fall into re@@ plen@@ ish , Ren@@ on for bonds will rise , and the economy will sink into a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
especially the history for the economy is only a small guide to the procedure .
a recession came in only 11 months after the first interest increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in terms of how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed such strong that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could notice that the whole excitement of a Zin@@ c increase may be exaggerated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Che@@ k@@ at at Capital Economics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still to the lower level , to the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear .
however , that does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a trend @-@ based look at how some areas of the economy might react :
as has seen the market last month , the withdrawal of Zin@@ c increases things for a while volati@@ le .
once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that investments in finances 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be abbrevi@@ ated , which perhaps once again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened according to the F@@ ed .
specifically , the market has mostly been warming up over the past 35 years - some 14 per cent - on the way to a rate increase , fairly flat in the last six last cycles of 14,@@ 4 percent , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will be based later in the increases cycle , and the return of return will begin to decrease .
rec@@ essions include a fact of economic life , but of interest rates do they promote .
in the current case the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions which did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely remarkable is that the GDP &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GDP &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the lowest points will be a raise of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Deutsche Bank the 118 interest rate since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.@@ 6 percent , only few expected this will last and expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high level of interest in such fragile economic setting could be risky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken the whole year on a withdrawal of the F@@ ed and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could approve a increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading could only be 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all down@@ cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum to GDP , and before starting rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing very quickly after the beginning of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 years so far .
the solid income was also volati@@ le , as the market increase a raise increase , and the pattern is pretty much the same as in the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares , if that change its strategic course .
if bonds seem to change the direction once the first increase / lowering is made in the cycle .
at the end of the height @-@ cycle the bond is immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in the interest rates will result in bringing a gap between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atter of curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ rate bonds often bring better income , though &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come Analy@@ zer in Schw@@ ab , in an Analyse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interesting is , Jones thinks that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has been adjusted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income gap is more fl@@ atter and the volati@@ lity is increased - all characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the large and entire businesses , companies who take the greater part of their business operations in the United States , profit from them if interest rates rises and will become more attractive to local products .
multinational companies with high debt will be worse because an increasing dollar puts their products on the global market more costly and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares are tend to respond very positively to three months after a initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percent@@ ages following each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ren@@ dits and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debts are a big issue .
businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest are losing the most , &quot; said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savings could see profits through higher yields , even though experts from different opinions are how quickly that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Spe@@ aker Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the sender because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ tainment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also took up the BBC Music Awards and said that she was im@@ itated The Br@@ its
parliament &apos;s colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins reached the voice The Voice on and said this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; transforms itself &quot; into Classic FM , claiming a leading backing member and raises new pressure on the sender , proving that he does something that does not do the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham was also saying the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ law radi@@ os@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and are increasingly unable to distinguish anymore from his commercial competition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to become Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also took the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , appear The Br@@ its only to be under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate that which is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General reported the accus@@ ations back and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial competition when it comes to public music and clarification of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I &apos;m not going to learn about classical music anywhere .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to help radio 3 to find new music and to give new works that I really consider , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that it necessary to be harder to get the audience as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
but Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it come under fire to face the commercial ri@@ vals into the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MEP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins reached The Voice on - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated savings of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - &quot; was produced on special BBC i@@ ority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a hit from our in @-@ house pen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it started a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to ex@@ crete the money of stir@@ red formats for other sub @-@ maintenance formats .
Internet sales up climbed in August at the slower and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sale .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to purchase
experts believe that the Black Friday has stopped the expenses in November
for over a decade the virtual setting has been dri@@ lled , and many of the chief shopping streets in Britain have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
however , experts say that there are now signs that their online revenues st@@ agn@@ ates after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rate in growth since the start of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales will be st@@ agn@@ ant after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the fores@@ een years and go back to 2000 , then it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales level .
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago , as a buyer began to make purchases with their cell purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now , the one comm@@ utes that and we will possibly see that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ Gold phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the retro@@ active revenues .
experts believe that buyers will stop their sh@@ opp@@ ings from this event , taking place in November last Friday in November .
last year , five times map the average number of buyers for their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some traders @-@ sites are star@@ ved .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer war@@ rants for bar@@ gains , buyers of them could ab@@ stain from purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium held that 5 bonus issues has been issued online for a little more than 1 £ online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of shopping are now being carried out through web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the mo@@ ths in the cities .
Muslims buried in Mecca at the crane crash - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funer@@ aries in Mecca through the streets
Saudi @-@ Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Sau@@ dis @-@ Laden @-@ Laden
the Ministry of Health said that in a total of 3@@ 94 people had been wounded , after the crane pl@@ unge
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the killed , which were killed , being a crane at Mek@@ kas W@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
crowded , large in white dressed to pay the distance to pay their respect when the first of the dead occurred their last trip to Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m @-@ gra@@ ve@@ yard .

the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 soldiers who were killed , being a crane by the Great Central Authority of Mek@@ ka , were worn by the streets .
among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m A@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane inter@@ ro@@ g@@ gled .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mecca with thousands that will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden @-@ group would not have ste@@ al the arm of the crane as he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decre@@ e , which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin @-@ Laden was not responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company is foreign to international travel .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man led to revealing what the overthrow of the crane caused , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the Grand mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place from the H@@ add@@ afi later this month .
the Bin Laden &apos;s group has no statements about the collapse of the crane and their representatives were not available for an opinion .

the late leader of Al Q@@ aida , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a comfor@@ ted son who was dispos@@ s@@ essed of the family in 1990 @-@ 20 years .
the cr@@ ashing of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in a life of every healthy person .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
government officials pre@@ arranged that 1 Million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay the members of the dead and the same amount of permanently bra@@ king .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap European crafts@@ man is over
British have increasingly employ craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe saw rise behind
this leads to 200 additional screens @-@ shops , which are aimed at arti@@ sans ,
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q stands will close nationwide
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that British have their h@@ amm@@ ers and brus@@ hes in favor of the use of qualified European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
if you can handle a hammer or a brush to the date of walls , you seem to be a minority today .
because British have increasingly employ craftsmen to perform home@@ work jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new business manager of pol@@ ishing , who owns the Bau@@ Markets chain , said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services to deep prices has now been over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more screening shops , to address the arti@@ sans and make 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women .
at the moment , the men are tw@@ ei@@ gh the men .
she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends , which shows more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to postp@@ one this more to a balance .
in principle , half of our clients consists of 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a huge role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British at FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also addressed their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
king@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company , representing exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her passed a decline in the half @-@ year win and the transformation , after the group owes the costs to the closing of the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q is opening up to 200 new branches .
functional of A@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before judgment
at the State Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt , on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian cro@@ vice @-@ vice @-@ vice , A@@ I / DO@@ B have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ref@@ usal education .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also indicted for abuse of authority .
of this accus@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted on in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the colon@@ el pro@@ secutor of the case , Robert Ri@@ ffel ( ) had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ examination that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 funds defined by the accounts recei@@ vers they used in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage caused by some 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also indicted for finance .
this fact dropped by the chairman of the S@@ hah , Ri@@ dge in Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the accus@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity presented the defense that the association had not yet emerged from the association at any point .
the sporting function@@ aries had only been calculated and recorded the sport club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had spent a lot of time and money , made from the debt - the pas@@ si@@ va bet@@ w in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 p@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; then , we stood before the situation : do we lead the club or block it ? , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ harvesting of the financial calendar .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to undertake this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have lowered money , our life insurance as a security in the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in the case of redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there must be only no debt .
furthermore - with the corresponding financial success the payout of the allowance for reimbur@@ s@@ ation until 1991 was adopted .
therefore , we have had a portion of the allowance for years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , the l@@ ump @-@ rate and not detailed sections , explained the former Ob@@ jects , explained the procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and austerity &quot; accounts for the two def@@ endants in common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the second def@@ endant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why the payments made by the association would not be detailed in detail , the judge asked .
the association was interested not in detail for the financial support , important is only the debt of the debt , so the answer .
as in 2011 against which an official investigations opened for authority during the year 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the account &apos;s account .
these were backs , the def@@ endants were told .
this securities account was held on the names of the second accused and was not known according to his statement by the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the judge .
the respon@@ dents knew long no answer to this .
then he said finally , he believed that this was the best for the club .
when something happened to him , nobody would have known something of that money , the pro@@ secutor put into the room .
the def@@ endant was notified , justify the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know reef and pro@@ secutor .
the first def@@ endant declared that he had not been in agreement with this wording as the association was never done any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all from the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
additionally , the function@@ ary said he never ordered a pen@@ ny salary , reck@@ ons he merely reck@@ oned with o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting .
at Di@@ et it has been charged to the club $ 1,000 per month , but the actual effort has been much higher , he added .
the def@@ endants were unable to identify exact documents for the early years .
these are after a operational examination , in which everything was judged as correct , no longer saved , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter had also the second accused .
all correc@@ tions are made in cash , in order to have to go to the Bank of St@@ el@@ burg in his home country , he declared in his statement .
the main proceedings will be continued on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard runs another 30,000 jobs

in this way , costs amoun@@ ted to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2,@@ 4 billion euros ) will be saved , the company arranged on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , resulting from the fourth quarter .

the world is observed if the U.S. exp@@ o bank on two days , which comes together on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision , whether for the first time in nearly a decade the interest rates are raised .
a survey conducted under 80 econom@@ ists which was interviewed by Re@@ uters , they found that a little more than half , which will do this last week , now thinks that the F@@ ed will keep doing something longer and keep the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may not leave the zero @-@ sector and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; Angel Or@@ bi@@ des , Leit@@ ner associates at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .

however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sting view of global conditions .
it has warned the markets to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday

he said , &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house , but who will not distur@@ b &quot; anyone , &quot; but probably will be upset .
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
he did not give an explanation for his shots .
when police came across the scene they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said said : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted , I could re@@ vert .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , they took 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he did E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he eventually took his own life on Monday Even@@ ing when police controlled him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said William La@@ For@@ ge , he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something with Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trinity relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , following statement of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les that was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , had been met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said , I was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he is not in jail . &quot;
when polic@@ emen inv@@ aded him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on that night he drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
he was awarded a PH@@ D in spring 2015 from the Delta State University like his life on the University &apos;s website .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play monthly because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w won at the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture in his right bank .
while this brought the left margin to tears and exclude it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by an in@@ consider@@ ate attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and required oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double frame and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , and then fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a Red Card and the nar@@ rowing of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not sanc@@ tioned the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had been vacc@@ inated .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account lau@@ ded : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how bu@@ sted I am , my way of recovery starts now , I &apos;ll be back stronger . &quot;
referred to : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of the PS@@ V
in France , the British defen@@ ders has an added incentive in France to recover until the coming June .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a com@@ eback , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ el@@ Holland @-@ team at the 2014 World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very heavy , because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he was touched &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; to him but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad there . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken into hospital - after a scar@@ f of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long before you turn it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favourite book book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron is written in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camp , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to have missed a picture or a message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in the Cameron presented the story of the book instead , instead tell a episode of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and detail to add to the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city Th@@ u @-@ Ville where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to win a boy named Ted , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , that he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose exact name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was lu@@ ke@@ over and the 1991 died , however completely unknown .
as if that was not yet suspi@@ ci@@ ously enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially presented like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie Gaz@@ ette , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ mati@@ cal father , it seems impro@@ bable that Cameron is getting too familiar to the action of the book . here an un@@ named boy , as the local environment falls through the wild Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , sn@@ ur@@ ous beings , &quot; which is occupied in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times in a child for a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ man said that the text was probably made by Cameron &apos;s electoral office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by expulsion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still hard
to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you chose the cad@@ res selected for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test shows not on my card .
I would not close a back@@ wards .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site might be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ player in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear a s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
the ball developed Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even when he represents an un@@ familiar size on the test plane , is an option for the attack .
in this way , Adam Ly@@ on@@ ex@@ det made out of England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to refrain from Adam Ly@@ th is of course not difficult for me than its chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ players are oriented on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said it before - players are their own best performers .
a long time ago it would have prolonged the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully proposes further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes out .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ at Bay@@ l@@ iss , praised his attitude , even if he did not produce so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test man receives in order to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th was given seven odds - like Sam Rob@@ sons before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton did get the chance to do home and reverse .
the only accus@@ ation that you can rise was that England replaced Jonathan the West at first - when ly@@ ric was in peak form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a perc@@ ussions I highly regard .
it is an X factor that Po@@ cket@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he got 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which met us very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must obtain at least the same opportunities as those before him , but of course this depends upon the team setting in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea , mo@@ een by cook to make what an extra spin Bow@@ ler can perform and four Qui@@ cks were received , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a perc@@ ussions can not beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ player of cri@@ cket players .
Mor@@ een might have his job done for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is it a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he entered into 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred cents immediately and looked not back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the ca@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited interaction with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there is no big number of backup spinning @-@ mates who raise their hands and the coaches have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has done a few smart additions at the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela So@@ awar@@ ding , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultants for the testing game could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes to the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in accordance with the said before .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate near Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ger , R@@ oot dealt a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some may not agree , but coaches and team@@ leaders do not determine the timetable .
and you must remember that your job will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit Camp ( Bre@@ xit = Out@@ put Great Britain from the EU ) could gain to Zul@@ u if the economy was put into a tor@@ ch up to 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ le@@ ashed re@@ action strategy in order to keep the UK in the EU will go deep into trouble with each day even without choosing the in@@ geni@@ ous Jeremy &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ Byz@@ n , the leader of Labour and TU@@ C , who escaped for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ ors and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ atically rel@@ im@@ s that some member states are so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises , such as the EU now is and not always its own fault , in Britain itself , formed the agenda with se@@ greg@@ den@@ ces and inter@@ fer@@ ing contract changes , which they most often do not want .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C ruled that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie &quot; agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers are climbing meetings at meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves in front of a famous local memorial , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will win aggres@@ sors for reforms .
it is all about me .
my European friend , who wants to look for the outside world inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us look out that more and more short @-@ sighted Minister and officials came up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s war@@ time chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a allies , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for it , as it has during the exaggerated long ex@@ termin@@ ations such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or a replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending strength .
Poland may soon have a nationalist left government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that it can be s@@ nat@@ ch up your leg to help the Sel@@ fie and save their energy from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to have , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st trends have .
therefore , some such ministers may even consider un@@ inten@@ tionally un@@ helpful comments , quite in SN@@ P style , while Great Britain approved surgery campaign in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , my friend .
&quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; and &quot; Britain has won much of its value from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how rob@@ bery @-@ Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU Sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ cian is the oligar@@ chy of the press @-@ bar@@ on , as it passed through Tony Ben@@ n @-@ induced referendum in 1975 but did not support our entry into 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remind you of Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ un@@ ists , who established a name as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in addition , the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing @-@ showers , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ging foreigners and the Pseu@@ do non @-@ Indians , who own most of our large newspapers .
actually , Tony Blair thought much about it , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , he had assumed more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as a Blair as he considers the referendum on the referendum being refer@@ enced by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that was then open to him by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
the press has never mis@@ led him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on the back on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he doesn &apos;t need any more time for me to spoil yourselves - seems in danger that Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks To repeat the 80 @-@ er years , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy in order to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ tis , whose BBC @-@ set@@ he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ mor@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional bl@@ ero@@ id Tenden@@ cy and the wild@@ est poems by Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism anyone can say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on Radio and TV this week said , when the boy sc@@ outs in him strug@@ gled to not admit that Cor@@ bi@@ t appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow specialist was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years when his old father willing to appeal to his Labour cabinet , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; to remain &quot; under all circumstances - Ben@@ ing expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , what J@@ C told his collaborators and MEPs after all reports on their final days on Monday evening .
whatever the touching picture @-@ up image of Cor@@ bi@@ n wants to communicate - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the paper campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think safe as soon as possible .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ bi@@ t basic ambig@@ u@@ ity on EU membership - in line with their pet@@ an@@ ite si@@ ege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist state - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which s@@ nar@@ c@@ issu@@ s of small su@@ sten@@ ance is a key principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is uns@@ ha@@ vo@@ iced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to withdrawal - foreign diplom@@ ats will be comm@@ ited to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home in all .
why should Paris or Berlin squ@@ ander political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions on the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the U.S. already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the launch on Monday of something which named British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise the Public Health England report on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 individuals , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined The Lanc@@ et by claiming to critic@@ ise the Public Health England ( phe ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nor released the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key@@ note report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , some researchers have placed the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data and pointed to the connections between a few experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month preser@@ ves the &quot; extraordinary wind@@ y base , &quot; at the phe developed his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have wondered whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ation that the current estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were called to conduct a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to guide their opinions on the damage of various nicotine containing products to a synthesis .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose manager had previously received the British / Tob@@ acco Ab@@ acco prize ( BA@@ T ) for independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to publicity in a sustainability report , they told .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not financing , which he should have received according to reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ et are not supplied , but include several well known E @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the min@@ t of tobacco took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work in the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products among most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these compounds or limitations in the phe report will be discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the asser@@ tions of phe , that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes have been a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well being at dawn , said that the BM@@ I had already been re@@ acted before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are substantially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to this are small but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
phe has the unique obligation to inform the public about what evidence is eviden@@ ced and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0.000 people are dying every year on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs a two billion euros per year .
through the clear advantages of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says the former head of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Rival &quot; will give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee would only be used to make the kind of programs that is not sent by other UK radio stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are likely to place public @-@ legal programs which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ regarded time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals , and of broadcast@@ ers as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
following the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which could also clearly be shown clearly by the ri@@ ven@@ tion@@ ated ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ communication committee as part of its investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the circular fee , what I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should put its production at least on programmes that others do not make or order .
you can send The Voice in a first class window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous , it &apos;s natural nonsense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why it finances a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs that could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another , admittedly both self @-@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm to it .
I compelled to see myself how this should be public @-@ lawful TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would cause the BBC ever at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , a contractor for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for reviews &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the ambitions of the people working there , and because they believe it &apos;s the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC broadcast again what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart @-@ lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ er@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ischen Programme &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where one can &apos;t accurately measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they argue if they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they place them in a window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
for the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system with respect to conditions who can get the best value in this .
of course , you think all that one gets a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , ask me whether this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David I@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to examine their au@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inform and entertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said only little of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should take an example of the public @-@ law television broadcast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms he said that only a handful of television is displayed , and with the commercial broadcast@@ ers will enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ fre@@ t &apos; can control the brain cells through sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ les are changing the direction in the moment they are being broadcast@@ ed with Klang@@ impul@@ sen .
scientists have bred spice with genetically modified methods which can be controlled by bro@@ o@@ ds of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des are changing the direction in the moment when they are with sound impulses , which are given to high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the stimul@@ i work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels , which respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms demonstrated the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ ads , with the ultr@@ asonic may be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure would replace one day the de@@ lows of the brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of men to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
f@@ ath@@ ors usually do not react to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out to for@@ tify the ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound@@ waves make the opening of these icons and activate the cells in which they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des , the Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ds TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry .
if he turns out ultr@@ as@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound@@ waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ blows and transfer into the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some similar features with Op@@ to@@ Logic , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch neur@@ ons with stimul@@ i of light and turn off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said , that Son@@ o@@ sta could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be revealed in an optical fiber , at the desired place in the brain , Ni@@ ed@@ in ultr@@ asonic ultr@@ as@@ ound tissue may be impro@@ per and thus can be sent in the brain from the top of the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the observed human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ for@@ ged 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the tense smile of those that I have offen@@ ded - and to the numerous , leg@@ at@@ onic symptoms of others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the pull @-@ up in student dormit@@ ories ranges from easy nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely da@@ unting .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to ch@@ unk@@ y : people tell where you are coming , where and where you are Sab@@ bat@@ ter , where you are in relation to Cor@@ bi@@ n and why you are &quot; honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a he@@ dge of Ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make your questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak out even if your eyelashes would fire into fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people know .
people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people draw and their under@@ wear .
in terms of : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted gets a crude treatment at the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a space @-@ to @-@ earth culture , which is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to rec@@ u@@ perate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship goes on , but you must go away to get the energy I need for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a comm@@ ut@@ one is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality , and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos so@@ ck@@ le : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closing through b@@ aking .
since you start the university at the height of back @-@ Man@@ ia , the knock is on the doors of people to imagine with a dish of Brow@@ nies , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I made you baked some . so , and now please smile if I give you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
her room@@ mates feel obliged to entertain yourself and will join perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
badly mis@@ ed l@@ ump of flour , sugar and gre@@ ase lead to that people can be sleeping , if you t@@ oss .
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student residence .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken , a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well ?
check that with the owner @-@ owner .
the chances are good that they say , even if they cook in the interior .
when someone ste@@ als your belon@@ gings , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to get more imbalance with my room@@ mate she added to her milk a sink to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
you should not make noise , the people from sleep or labour .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb says to the people who sit in the Glass House .
a girl in my fo@@ yer asked her neighbors , if it makes them something good , drum and bass turn something qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to those with loud music .
when she finally heard about 5 pm , her neighbours were kindly allowed to sleep two hours before she allowed her own music to shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour examination .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen by chance in the same student residence ?
vice versa , it would not be ab@@ y@@ sm@@ elling too embarrassing for you to hold a room@@ mate for your future partner to get in herself and then you have to see each day and maybe experience how she over@@ l@@ ates all common friends ?
of course the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot co@@ hab@@ itation is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk a little reason at least to your under@@ wear .
in the upright moment you notice that someone has his key in his non@@ slip room , the border between an ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ment , as it seems .
a good battle is fun , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding an valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but do not miss anyone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place their keys in a glass of water , which you can then put in the freezer - but you don &apos;t notice their domini@@ ons at the ceiling no more than twice .
ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees , single @-@ ear@@ ners , Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ner
the real estate contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the medium @-@ established can@@ tic@@ ular spring houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing , but also the mother and Ger@@ ard ear@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how one can continue to build a cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushed to the residential market .
the entrepreneur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how quickly cheaper living room can be created : it builds in a project rac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , a lot of refugees will drive on the residential market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
because people stay here for some great extent .
in the face of the refugee stream , we need enough space in the coming decades .
a whole , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a row house needs the least square .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different when one puts people in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are just being built in the pilot department , consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a living room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back .
the houses can be changed easily according to their needs .
what is the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house stands on 18@@ 4 000 Euro , with no property .
this is manage@@ able .
six months the building took us .
this is reasonable .
do the construction instructions make their plans complic@@ aded ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : legally , I have drawn up my project correctly .
particularly complicated , it is always the dro@@ h@@ itting Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ gra@@ ft special construction and the space @-@ space order .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
there is still under@@ lining who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the towns is there a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants respond to their Town@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating a luxury built for asylum seekers .
what definitely is not true .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true yet , we have had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but new luxury homes were built to afford .
my project has the message , also the normal human beings need a living space .
not only refugees , but also the native Mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can continue to build a cheap and well @-@ known one today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system , When Apple update will be released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gener@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are encountered problems after the installation because they received an error message that defeated the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to deal with the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush go back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
that may mean the delete from apps to create space - but Apple has been more likely to do that by joining the updates . likewise , it will be easier to use this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a lo@@ ader , so the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue , since the phone may un@@ folded up in half way and lead it to a demo@@ lition of updates .

only after that I decided whether meadow is displayed , or not .

men check out on 17 @-@ year Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seeks the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ ut : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mon@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police their two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait yet to wait for him .
at this time the group was on the level of the B@@ FT Gas station .
on the premises of the gas station also three people stopped .
one of these men now cried out to the young and hit this with the fist fits .
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ ction and a bleeding very strongly from the nose .
when his two friends im@@ min@@ ated and re@@ ate on the bats , he initially left his sacrifice at first .
from his friends the last young man was now home .
the perpetr@@ ator per@@ ed the group by passenger cars up to the apartment and drove off several times over there .
when we no longer saw the vehicle , the last one went ahead of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was re@@ attacked by the bat and another male figure .
taking a gra@@ ves@@ cing of a stroke can be checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the last had to be brought to hospital for health care .
so far only a v@@ ague tat@@ too is present .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ lows .
we are also looking forward to Zambia , Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist , Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand are lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on the 1st of October .
while UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ lows are reti@@ re@@ at , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still working with half a position during the next few months .
after undergoing construction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro into the premises at the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy for the first glance , when Frank Müller and his wife were met with Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at present he studied their professional aqu@@ educ@@ ative work at the Ver@@ dener hospital .
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ste@@ wards and laughs .
&quot; when it was far , I simply called them . &quot;
after the couple of Müller the idea of working in A@@ sen@@ dorf appeared to operate the own practice in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year Mu@@ eller .
&quot; we would like to see and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also sees his own boss .
and so there was agreed that the Mü@@ llers bought the house with practice .
living they continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the master @-@ family @-@ father of Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several doctors &quot; offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
at present he has been active as the commander in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed to the executive staff in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is committed to the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
while the surgeon operates Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Har@@ ste@@ wards as a primary care , his wife UR@@ SE@@ L ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) has specialised in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mosquit@@ oes , both inter@@ nis@@ ten , want to settle for general practitioners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is thus out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and resili@@ ence @-@ EK@@ GS and need a consultation room more .
furthermore , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed .
a grant of € 50@@ 000 to get the Mü@@ llers in a funding program from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; empha@@ sizing the principal conductor Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , each quarter results in the practice of Fel@@ lows , in the North German A@@ practice practice , are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is yet another general practitioner &apos;s office .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice of practice by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains loud UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ lows in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , she would have gone too .
anyone who visits Mü@@ llers is still above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical colleges and the cleansing of the rim .
with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the medi@@ cs have practi@@ sed 30 years there .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls UR@@ SE@@ L rim .
a little of melanchol@@ y they feel after a long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will certainly often see , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin .
your husband is comple@@ mented : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself from gardening that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also , the couple has two grandchildren and travels to his travels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls were raised also at our border &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum application can make this also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people is at the forefront .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clear it is also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , not from the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia .
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia &apos;s plans to continue traveling in Austria and Germany and also set cor@@ ridors for refugees .
this is exactly how the Interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach though not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia will rather intensify the surveillance of the border - particularly to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled than the external border of the Schengen area .
as the minister emphasized , Slovenia does not want to seal the border for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out his commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government po@@ ked , the first refugees would have already tried in the night @-@ hours on Tuesday to pass the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d before the border , in order to exp@@ ire the registration .
the Croatian police could pick it up in the near @-@ fields .
since then , according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik regularly meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mostly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
also li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ards and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country with around 4,000 refugees , said Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo would be located at the Maced@@ onian border , which had formerly led migrants to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it is to strike the people , certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we can nor do we do this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Ser@@ b border city of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were the whole night out of the approximately 500 kilometres distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has promised , so let us have said the police that we are to drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , it could actually be actually before the predicted shift of the previous Balkan route in Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatian &apos;s interior ministers O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong up@@ stream of refugees corresponding plans for potential exceptional situations .
details were not calling , but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member have comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
you lead to strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , since 2007 , the EU @-@ Partner spl@@ its into the country a good witness , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the side of the Hungarian border , about 300 refugees continue to be stuck on the Hungarian border .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports they would have spent the past night at the crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border transi@@ tions of Hor@@ gos and back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to continue on the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian interior ministers N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm at a local rate in Hor@@ gos : he maintains the debates on alternative routes to refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
it would not currently be a very high power of refugees .
they cannot say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to spread to the refugees of land cards where alternative routes in Croatia are indicated .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is less dangerous : in parts of the border , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian civil war still un@@ riv@@ alled min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team has been sent to min@@ de@@ ers in the border region .
stock h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is set to have heard at a ring of cy@@ ber@@ criminals that has been accused of providing information in un@@ released financial reports and press releases on websites like Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire .
with the exploited information , In@@ sider transactions should be taken on the financial markets .
a total of over 100 million dollars had been launched in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the S@@ EC message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials of 32 other accus@@ ation in the case went on .
most of the def@@ endants were from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are intended to be active in both the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ itals Of Mannheim has been around for 20 years

&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ sing , jumping all life in a wonderful autumn note and in the middle of it four big tables at each with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ fore I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ aid help with this action on her twenty @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we have gone through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ era Wel@@ fare stands for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers .
while some of an Pass@@ ant has interven@@ ed in the chal@@ k , and to read the proposition for &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the camper by the U.S. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not long , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop , say phrases like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;m not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and again at the edge of little discussions on the action on themselves , about life , dealing with death .
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger just arrived on site .
&quot; only when I make sure that sometime the end of this world comes , I can live responsibly , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband beams of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ ers .
therefore , this public action was good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
however , that not everyone wants to publicly communicate on the tablets , be understandable , but finally it is a very personal matter .
the issue of death and dying is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , though exactly the Hosp@@ it@@ iz@@ ations in recent years have contributed a lot to the fact that people open themselves .

when the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ aid was sought after speaking by volunteers , they immediately reported it and be with it when it was founded in 1995 .
Go@@ eb@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the insured and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and hosp@@ ice , Sankt @-@ Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ co@@ y@@ roid can handle well with its job and the experiences and experiences made here .
&quot; I see the life of another War@@ ts , consider it precious , and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says .
the offer of the patient @-@ patient hospital service is free of charge and den@@ omin@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of family members and associations enable training as well as training and supervision of ster@@ be@@ - and ob@@ itu@@ aries .

there can also be more personal wishes on post@@ cards as well .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports betrayed results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ber @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his profit perspective on a whole year because of the weaker market demand for cargo services and higher costs at his bo@@ xing .
the company also said that she plans to recru@@ it roughly 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time in the past year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to adjust 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the market market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. announced a prize of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year to earn 20 cent less than in previous pre@@ diction .
analy@@ st expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which are an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and are effective on January 4 , and in spite of increased supply of bo@@ xing for bo@@ xing of heavy and large packages that are required from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result was increased from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher earnings and because of growth in the online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings &quot; solid yields in order to take into account the weaker than anticipated economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holidays were announced one day later than those of the Rival U@@ PS , who plans to set 9@@ 0.000 up to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned $ 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve of the packs of Investment Research asked analysts predicted .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the sho@@ acks were expecting an expected of 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
for the past few years F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in the international company &apos;s level of transport to st@@ agn@@ ant revenues in its unit Express @-@ Versand .
but the boom in the online @-@ shopping has raised the results in F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express entity awarded higher earnings because of higher prices , while the result was declined because of higher labour costs in cargo .
in the market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares for 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2,5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed at 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent on a record high on June 11th .
on their most anticipated meeting in the years , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot in Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the benchmark interest for the first time since almost a decade .
on top of them on an end of the bran@@ ched , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ thing seat is a m@@ ural in the United States .
the map is a reminder that Jan@@ et L. Y@@ els and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double job of Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is a failed third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate would be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether US economy is getting ready to become reconc@@ iled by the un@@ parall@@ eled incentive through the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turmoil in the global financial markets would make pru@@ dent F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government - and whether it is only one quarter of percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will first be the most important thing to watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Che@@ f@@ econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext , not to increase the interest rate , the increased insecurity about the global market has enough justification , to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself ass@@ ures the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently surve@@ yed by Bloomberg , predicted a raise this week .
the financial markets are waiting for a rep@@ ay@@ ment of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which indicates only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed has increased the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists decreases the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score was worth 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1,4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the campaign was triggered by anticip@@ ation that the F@@ ed Policy holds the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ k@@ con@@ om at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get in panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a bill raise funds would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate insecurity about when the F@@ ed will act .
still a month ago the F@@ ed seemed to increase by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in slow intensi@@ fication of the monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ella had said in spring and early summer that , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the proposition .
even though the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was strong this year .
the unemployment rate sank to 5.2 % in the last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and close to the level , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
payment delays have shown signs of recovery .
and although the inflation was constantly going under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary result of much lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Che@@ con@@ fession@@ al near Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the globe arrived at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage occurred in May by more than 16 % at its peak , as investors afraid that the slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would be the global growth .
the market has recovered this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives the market upheav@@ al influence the complex calculation when you can increase the interest rates .
&quot; if events were not occurred on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past couple of weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Not@@ en@@ bank .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least a month to better control the impact .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere note of the Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed suggests its mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; close &quot; possible con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined with each other , by F@@ ed representatives , they cannot only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also get advised to other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for the management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that seem to be linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , A @-@ fle@@ dged member of the Federal Open Market Committee , called itself for a raise increase , took decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia took the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark interest by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; said a limited impact on growth in the U.S. , &quot; L@@ acker said .
a year later F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the breakthrough in 2008 , said Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee on the interest rates of the Bank of England .
the most recent turmoil do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly won &apos;t get into the situation where fear of a raise increase because the markets are upright , &quot; he said , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe that it should be expected at the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany for these days .
preparing you a warm welcome , does not go without the dedication of innumerable volunteer volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who are un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is one with the body and soul teacher .
with their 74 L@@ ences they are still happy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seekers in the D@@ ill@@ inger street . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this is completely different classes than at a right school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is trying to determine how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies which are painted in breasts by paints with representations of unhealthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies give all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification you should implement .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating ran@@ ged over the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ &apos;s Sports Hall
the municipal Bern@@ ried approved the construction entry for 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar power .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around at the Bernstein &apos;s sports ground go step by step : in the recent community meeting , the extensive construction site was dro@@ w@@ ned without major discussions .
previously , the panel provided an application for a legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from valid development plan , among other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special design with regard to the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an &quot; saddle @-@ roof is &quot; to be built with non @-@ operating First and bad@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the surface for solar power : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus we get a wonderfully large southern Greece , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained by Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; liberation &quot; it was again about the te@@ aring , which is for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - to lie under ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan on the sky@@ line does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the am@@ ber representation of the common system usually proceeds in more restric@@ tive strategies during the process of liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turn@@ around at the sports center is a community project of the municipality and of S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the costs are around 2.3 million euros .
grants are expected from school and grass@@ roots promotion .
as the next step of proceeding , the building entry for the 18 x 36 metres high hall will now be presented to the site office .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed before - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this sees the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites confirmed .
however , a decision on this will be the Supervisory Board , and the conven@@ es on the coming Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans are put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees would keep on employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should now move with fishermen and the continue existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the spaces are available .
employees who cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au in Wei@@ l@@ heim , should be offered in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites .
the employees are informed of the plans .
he has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private office near the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question of who the follow @-@ up is , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , who was set up to take charge of 1 October and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the field of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites .
fishermen is a specialist for heart @-@ step and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
col@@ loqui@@ al for the next two years is said to bring fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board of that agrees , both homes , until then next year , the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ ella , which still needs more than 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , the country has planned this for 2018 , if the current restructuring at the hospital in Wei@@ l@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Land@@ rä@@ tin Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites , which is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ ors the house which is in possession of the Federal Council , in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the close I out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it goes on with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ Wh@@ ites could not say , there were several reflections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ ous@@ y housed there .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity would not come back , &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi @-@ move to Le@@ ch , who was positively accepted by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot;
a real perspective for the house , in which fishermen have been working for over thirty years as a boss , have not given it .
he was asked of Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to take the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ der@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) had been at risk of closing in recent decades , for instance the surgery and Obst@@ etri@@ cs .
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar Lion are present tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) with the Berg@@ ische HC .

refugees need accommodation : study warned before housing
the position in the German residential area is tense .
ever more refugees search for a payable place .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is in front of a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German apartment market have long since started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and unemployed from the EU are pushing more and more people onto a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , by 2020 there would need 400@@ ,000 new units to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this result , a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is commissioned by the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , more than 60@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
to that way there are 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer committed to living as asylum seekers in a first accommodation .
many come across the flat market and are ins@@ cribed in the long sn@@ akes in front of the flat rentals .
however , according to Statisti@@ cal Bundes@@ amt , in last year , less than half of all asylum seekers have stayed to rent .
the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in housing policy of recent years .
Germany shoot a flat deficit in front of itself , which is getting bigger from year to year .
currently missing in the metropolitan areas already around 7@@ 7@@ 50,000 living units , laments Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in big cities not@@ ches in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults survived because of the per@@ lu@@ te at the apartment market un@@ tarily turns into &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square meter per capita in recent years has declined significantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim of this is to restart new incentives for social housing .
this could be disp@@ ens@@ ed on the under@@ mining tax and the fundamental tax for subsi@@ ed apartments will be exposed .
furthermore , according to alliance attractive tax @-@ fatigue @-@ free .
the support programme for refugee camps of the Bundes@@ bank Kf@@ W are already well attended by towns and communities .
a good week after the start was started on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros .
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are offering corridor
after Hungary there is practically no coming out , as more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia .
Zagreb announces that the journey through Slovenia to north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but dangerous for the route is dangerous .
Croatia agrees with the Slovenia &apos;s neighbour on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian cour@@ ses@@ in and when it is necessary we organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s country @-@ country is not a Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ down of the ser@@ b@@ arian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees dropped to Croatia to go from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports of the Croatian V@@ RT@@ L section .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day of day .
new laws , which occurred on the same day in power , over@@ took this decent asylum application in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; you can travel , and we prepare for that opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the EU neighbouring country .
most of these are reports concerning Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and with Ta@@ xen in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they would be tempted to walk on the green border to Croatia on foot .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees do not come to the border .
but this also poses other dangers to this present : there are sharp Min@@ es from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de@@ mining are now able to create a secure passage in a fast passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungary there is hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police t@@ acked 3@@ 66 gri@@ lled people .
shortly before the gate on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws are the process of overcoming and damaging the boundary of us as a crime .
in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
sentenced to five years and deportation from the country up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration office , on Tuesday , on Tuesday in the newly furnished &quot; tran@@ se@@ greg@@ ations &quot; a total of 94 rejected , almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants is 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped .
however , there is no one left to be granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seekers should be de@@ ported .
a few hundred refugees were gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to grow up with that .
they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish , tens of thousands of people over the past few weeks on the road@@ side .
the wave of kni@@ ves were dis@@ assembled and one of the stor@@ ks in the border line has been altered .
for the purpose of this conversion , nobody wanted to express itself .
Austria can only reach a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants had stopped in government , but still in the country .
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the further journey to Germany .
the railway traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by directive German public authorities .
in fre@@ ew@@ ays there were regularly smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot .
Mayor of the &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ som &quot; over the borders
&quot; we were busy after the Brü@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday with the elevator , when suddenly ten people were standing on entrance to the tent at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says Wern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly focused on Sunday because of the flow of refugees with Austria , for them it was in Wern@@ stein concludes , &quot; says Shi@@ as , who immediately offered his help and the stretched together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the N@@ ahe river .
before we had the un@@ hoped @-@ hoped @-@ hoped @-@ to , with J@@ ause and drinks .
we have said right away , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler im O@@ Ö@@ N .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very happy that the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pushed @-@ up draw@@ backs were on Sunday evening at Wels of an ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to make it possible after the short notice that the railway traffic has been set to Germany , but still to try the border .
the regional train was asked before the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border in general on the track .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday cleaned , week@@ days before a branch @-@ outlet - organised by the Union Wern@@ stein und Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent more tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ holy policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of supporting structures in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the establishment of structures , the Federal Republic has officially lifted up our German Chancellor and upgraded the position of the Hungarian government in the m@@ ist of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
athle@@ tic policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing the border areas with chaotic conditions .
even the gi@@ ans will have to determine that the &quot; yellow land &quot; that they have invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp .
a major challenge will be given , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , with us to make decent work conditions for human seekers .
and it will be an even bigger - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
finally Conrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 hibernation
Conrad has all hands to do with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight .
the government has deployed the previous powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen ban@@ kers to expose the refugees to thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ year centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has finally got a grip on behind .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday is without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Interior Ministry in the Interior spoke of an &apos; cr@@ ack@@ able situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5.000 Quar@@ terly in the He@@ ur@@ anic year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodations will have to be found within the next few weeks - 20,000 inhabitants will deliver , 15@@ ,000 the federal government .
should we get more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already conducted talks with the Landes@@ haupt@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have promised him to do things even for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Scho@@ born , who will be trans@@ figured out how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations of asylum is also committed to the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the platform can offer uncomplicated properties on the platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , one hopes for hotels that are empty during winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday , Conrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed yesterday the standards for the accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of need , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ ll@@ ator must respect a certain height of the hand@@ sha@@ ker or size of the upper arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergen@@ cies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had been successful with his experience as opposed to the interior of the interior of the interior . however , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gentleman , which one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ se@@ hood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Conrad and Mai@@ er did not cause any costs to the republic , as they asser@@ ted themselves .
their staff members want to increase it to three to four .
the own quest for accommodation has not been successful until now .
Konrad wanted to set a container at Stephan@@ splatz as office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for better distribution
not only any opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment because you can find the persons concerned currently without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for the emergency , however , further sites are to be checked for their vi@@ ability .
criticism of the city &apos;s government at the division of refugees within the federal state .
also other areas need to make their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) outlines the further action in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that German borders are not sealed .
the development of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible .
however , there is now also the corresponding border controls .
for further excursions with refugees in Germany there will be no more .
however , the seekers came to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that Austria also carries Austria to its borders again , is for stir@@ er@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical cor@@ oll@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the procedure of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of office and production building , the IT Group S &amp; T moved out , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is intended to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies under technology area .
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss , Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine , in Star@@ tup company , to invest in the new ship@@ yard , and later on which is to be acquired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; right from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - whereby D@@ haus@@ er promised a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.@@ 7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3,@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meters resi@@ des in the building are rented already , for another 40 percent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened a second shop in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
actually J@@ utta was wanted to put a dog on a dog .
this project had to postp@@ one the 49 year @-@ year @-@ year owner from Li@@ a Per@@ oni into the exchange market . finally , she now got growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop in relation to the shop where they sold under other pockets , suit@@ cases , foot@@ wear and gar@@ ment of different manufacturers , now all revol@@ ves around d@@ amen@@ ity of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are available from 75 Euro .
larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks have been re@@ developed .
&quot; but I have long over@@ laid down if I want to open a shop , &quot; says broadly .
decisive for the decision was among other things , that even the Fur@@ la Produc@@ ers , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the non @-@ profit in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who herself has Italian roots .
their fashion is wide from her mother to the cradle .
meeting the most when something develops and I can show new trends at performance prices .
why so some woman should be happy with the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , also the wife could not answer with last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is util@@ ised for every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher out of K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came out of a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the U.S. president wants to become .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for exciting reasons .
whether it is concerned to alien@@ ally un@@ amm@@ able , journalists , or knowledge sources in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential guard will s@@ wir@@ led the electoral campaign .
and cuts out well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ily K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the real estate of millions records originate .
the New Yorker at the F@@ ishing refresh@@ ment is a concept for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village is over -@@ ei@@ ghty corners with it is related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign .
the Cas@@ all@@ city of Simone Wen@@ del filmed a movie about Tru@@ mp .
and what do people think about its goal , becoming a powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native ke@@ epers has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spro@@ uts which besides tur@@ no@@ mp are also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz belongs .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ esty comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not come to the king of the hearts .
while there are respect for the performance of the family , but I tend to show that Tru@@ mp is a bit a big mas@@ onry , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nickname of the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the Um@@ kreis , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &apos; - to High German : the gi@@ ver , says it .
so , Tru@@ mp comes from the village of An@@ gi@@ ers .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened in the US a pub for gol@@ d@@ fish .
the property of the property property were first property purchases in New York .
however , the life of grandparents was not free from tragedy : your desire to return to a period in the home , failed by the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate had then belonged .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once di@@ gest@@ ed without permission , the director of the Institute for Classi@@ cal History and Folklore , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
that is contrast to the swe@@ ar statements of the descendants .
this had repeatedly made obsol@@ ete about the import of Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the being powered , it is not so ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote hand@@ shake , the grand@@ pa was a born ( &quot; Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the winem@@ akers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; retirement in retirement looks rather stand@@ off@@ ish the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is always so thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm was mentioned as man@@ ners K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family continues to don@@ ate something for the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice because &quot; he has such a radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who were in the US at the time of his grandfather in the US had been like he would , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ck Sarah F@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , which was interviewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , have seen 12 000 th@@ at@@ ars , also in the USA awake the interest .
the Upper Bav@@ arian municipality Ram@@ sau bei Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain Sty@@ rian village . &quot;
from the hand of the Vice @-@ President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den received the award for gentle tourism at the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain village villages . &quot;
in the neighboring country the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain Sty@@ rian village &quot; is allowed to have at most 2500 inhabitants .

Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the ratings , despite the attempts of Nine to take the loss of leadership in the Today show
Karl Ren@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son will hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report the loss of the leaders of the liber@@ als but it did not have big shifts with the reviews for today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast@@ ed by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ ory , over the down@@ fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ chart , reported in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun .
this downside of the board seemed to be no role for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise above 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators were obtained with the five major cities compared to this Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase from the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3.000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap of Sun@@ rise has closed in the past few months .
in August today posted an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 .
until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at today .
this is the most interesting what happens every morning .
the winds of change affects this dawn more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ al of Al to the Raf@@ tes Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama of a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son managed to wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result from yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L .
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z shows , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , on average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday , the first half hour was reached from The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour of 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decrease in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will also be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will eventually catch at 17 : 30 pm .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars , which managed not to bri@@ ghten the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
revealed to be secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ an@@ ons @-@ rim , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparently , who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor eventually lands , was wrapped in greatest secrecy .
and none of the three left girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ sin@@ ons rim in the day before coming out of three , you possibly have given an indication of who will be the victory .
Sam Wood continues his lips until the Final on Thursday sealed .
all three women left themselves in ly@@ rical way on why wood is the perfect man and that sty@@ led his sense of humour , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get the last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could they be fatal to the game , who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ an@@ ons @-@ rim and Mark@@ os@@ ki ex@@ iles them both quickly - except for itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I walked into the house and found ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ ans told everyone .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet . it is so fun to be together with her &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week was her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game -- I am un@@ reserv@@ edly on him now , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose to Wood , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said .
I love the left girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams sent over to his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a scr@@ am@@ ble so he lost his Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ cord in his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to an Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also in the ongoing game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true paint in the locker room after the game .
instead of gr@@ asp@@ ed his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team to gr@@ ind the mill , encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne also was encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ hey , who ri@@ cks him to forget his pat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched in a Pun@@ t who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start to hoped the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian poetry for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the board and told later the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that now happens , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; says Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne dealt with his origin with his origin in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area came to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall it was a wonderful experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hay@@ ne pos@@ ited for a photo with fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and took it on his Inst@@ agram .

&quot; otherwise we will get eng@@ ages in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Free Movement of the Free voters conven@@ es to Friday in the fran@@ con@@ ian Comm@@ une .
actually , very different main topics were provided .
however , the number of refugees now also dominates the Free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will be over@@ lap &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger asked the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , the way it existed during the Serbian wars in the nin@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it goes not further , we have to go to the causes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Free voters chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push the Free voters as quickly as possible .
therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also required more staff for the administrative courts , who are responsible for asylum systems : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
the F@@ W leader critici@@ zed that several Bundes@@ länder will not be consistent : &quot; we are nationwide across nationwide standards in the federal states . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria sli@@ ps , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we have to be capable of handling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the national policies in the big Wal@@ lo@@ af is not to be reached under the table .

yet this is not far enough .
&quot; the subject of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss .
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums , who want to .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussion about the bur@@ dens from the nuclear issue has temporarily down the shares of RW@@ E temporarily on a record and left deep traces at eon . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed , after polic@@ emen shoot on demonstrators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police over@@ flew with a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the force broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , guided district schol@@ ar said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside of a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ ab@@ eng@@ as and then shot in the air before she res@@ igned on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the amount of rubber bul@@ lets , known by which they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a lesser known alternative , obviously produced such a high rate of death .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ lag@@ i say that new provinces to be formed under the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ u , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent struggles since the 10 .
killed August , when the four major political parties were signed an agreement , divided the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , that has been ruled centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution was on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lature have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the prevailing draft in Kathmandu and have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

under the pressure of the project @-@ criticism and the F@@ DP faction , with the investors and management of secrecy , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann passed from the system construction management board at the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and over 50 visitors .
however , it may be good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the project has been around 10 to twelve million euro and has been in discussion for months now .
fierce reactions among the sea landlords who came to the meeting were called out the pictures and new details of the desired hotel structure .
Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member in the group representative of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , laments : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z over@@ looks at all the other gi@@ au@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , he fears like several other project critics that the traffic would greatly increase due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no need to come , so that Schulz takes place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the good of a h@@ ect@@ are of great area of the former hospitality , is however still open .
nor is there no operator .
&quot; first , we have to have a logical concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends .
because this was still lacking , the development plans were still variable .

Google has an un@@ usually personal approach during the announcement of a donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who had f@@ lown with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark stations and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but because the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are des@@ perate to help .
we don@@ ate donations to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .

weight loss can be helpful for slightly overweight Di@@ abe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to tell if readily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery are longer living as those who do not receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; die @-@ death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to record food .
over the years , obesity operations have been beneficial for treating type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been carried out in humans , which are abnormal obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people having a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity in obesity , an upset stomach and stomach adhesive - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people , which were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I , which has been subjected to this operation , dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I stayed with those who did not receive non @-@ surgical diabetes , approximately equal to 29 .
among those who undergo any surgical procedure , occurred at 36 % the diabetes disease completely and at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is completely dissolved in only one percent and partly by only about two percent .
in addition the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also performed the patient @-@ blood levels of Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , writing the researchers .
after the surgery the average hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined from some 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you express yourself in the improved vo@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced not the mortality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng h@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also includes average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight in comparison to the Gast@@ ro@@ kt@@ om@@ ie Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and increased decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2 % ) and reported rather a complete overthrow of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival in surgery over five years , there are indications of a study of heavy people in Sweden that runs surgery to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was with obes@@ e people , subjected to an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival for the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ assur@@ ing for individuals with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we get people to take it seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they &apos;ve accumulated this genetic changes that have joined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love @-@ story plays at the H@@ uns@@ rück .
it is an issue that is growing more attention at this time in fiction : a young woman , to school hours un@@ popular and in@@ si@@ ghtly , hits the flock of her youth after years , and this one loves herself in her .
so also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der .
beyond love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , for it plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe cannot take up all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East encountered .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader asked for an end to violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the prolonged refugee crisis at the start of its ten day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , who dedic@@ ates ethics studies .
he asked that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama promised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; addressing several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to contem@@ plate long @-@ term solutions , such as a genuine peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved this problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the September 11th terrorist attack , and that the violent reaction of the US took a chain of irre@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 I have expressed my applause in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he made force a , and this has created unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
forty @-@ fold increase of intake of hand @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
Gi@@ ver Control centers in the US report on an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under the age of twelve to swal@@ low the strong drinks @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants so Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , we climbed the cases of revenues of manual inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the tox@@ ins centres , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly becoming more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the ER , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children are inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant drinking , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube reveal how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants would only drink because of a cheap experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people said supposedly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixed with non @-@ quality mou@@ th@@ wash in order to drink a tougher beverage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
younger children can be angel@@ ing from attractive d@@ ots of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are saving .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , wine grapes and oran@@ ges that are very appealing for children .
hanging inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants can have a few sp@@ lash @-@ poison@@ ing to alcohol .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , the medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ep@@ y hospital in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let your sip whis@@ ky wrap around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then there is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four injections of to straw@@ berry fra@@ grant in school , was brought into an emergency ad@@ ation to the treatment .
her blood non @-@ concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered as drunk at an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical practitioner , who treats them in the G@@ angle Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ est her words and was not able to go when she came in the emergency .
doctors experienced them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and got his head struck , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very scary , &quot; said Ort@@ ler Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N .
it could have fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
regarding alcohol @-@ poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with death cases .
in 2013 two women were killed in Ontario women following the gor@@ ges of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that denied a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
staff of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol has spark@@ le a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ anol , which was noted as active ingredients .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York , their &quot; sculp@@ ted &quot; teacher to po@@ isons since they put anti @-@ bacterial products around the school or so it was a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to mu@@ d@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them out of their space .
the police regarded the failed plan as &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; and dismis@@ sed Inter@@ disciplinary action to the school@@ office .

there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y in Celtic Glasgow , which was spontane@@ ously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . it insisted that he and his team @-@ amer@@ ica were not under higher control because they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch tab@@ ular guide .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it .
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football fans - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former National @-@ player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the ranking .
de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ranking is not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m Games and there aren &apos;t just people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will let the things around , sw@@ am di@@ ke .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chef makes you turn up matters .
after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now stand with five points prot@@ ru@@ sion clear at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we do this exactly like that - but we must go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the player better .
joining together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton gently for January @-@ transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer @-@ window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer will have this season @-@ time to integrate that which you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes , more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to the one you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it all rises .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period May to July in 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without labor for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate from 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as shown by the figures for national statistics ( ons ) .
in the meantime , employment was over 12@@ ,000 in Scotland during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell at 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent over the course of the quarter - a number above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ i commented the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of government has put the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have witnessed further improvements on the Scottish labour market , with a increase in employment and a decline of unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why to be a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I shall watch how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma state Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip is ex@@ iled by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was presented for the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew closer , I began to be afraid .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since more applicants are available as places , a flawless lottery will take place to decide which is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma reduces the number of media sites from 12 to 5 .
anyone who is chosen will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I cannot do that .
I would like to sit alongside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of my friend , with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with telephone and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants to and you get access .
I proc@@ ure myself with her .
she adm@@ its that she could have tried it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong with what I do .
Richard Glos@@ sip had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I said to him , that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter was present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty is to help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is located next to me .
if you want to know more about the event you hear the series of pod@@ casts I have done .
I don &apos;t want to go down here to all details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no enough evidence to justify a death penalty .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I shall see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter that you can turn to for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y him out and threatens to end racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his stables in the past year and put forward the race immediately .
he took on the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ated Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the late Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy &apos;s said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself did find himself under difficult circumstances , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt test of Li@@ dar@@ is which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it had kept down for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage alleg@@ ations and did not want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see it as too highly sensitive grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been eating long , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it is extensive .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to move about the main tour , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more trainers .
then I have to think what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had tried the Bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integr@@ ated Department has tried to sp@@ y its pen .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will name when I was asked - and offered him a job in my stables for providing information about what I do inside my stables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if that is the case , they should certainly summ@@ arise themselves to their n@@ oses , because they are trying to grip me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . chair of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ y , current president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ ache , current president of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I consider that it is personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L bar@@ ge behaviour and maybe people outside trainers are responsible for what is occurring in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and cast me off , and I have no doubts whatsoever that what I say will make them think about it now .
but I have now arrived at the point that it doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the coaches of the coaches have been set up with the long lasting Kob@@ alt examination in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to it that he could &quot; take his license via the table . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposed to the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has wron@@ gly been applied lu@@ dge on the leg .
it could have been that evening like that .
it could have been such a day yesterday , which was so .
but it also had such a race day .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the packing on the race day . an examination of this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sydney Roo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators put the Storm @-@ player &quot; Ring@@ eling &quot; with his team during the high Storm Vic@@ tory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a hardly covered note of the Storm @-@ Team after his crew winning the final victory against North Queensland cow@@ boys in Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland to be &apos; too good &apos; in the rings .
Bell@@ y@@ exports defended the g@@ ack@@ lim@@ o of his crew and said they were &quot; concentrated only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ y@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team keep him confident as it was eager to get kno@@ cked by the Storm &apos;s team .
&quot; this emerges , and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ struggles when she joined us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ ver@@ ge on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that in the whole year nothing changed alongside our defensive system or techniques . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ackl@@ es a real emphasis and that has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train , so he probably won &apos;t get used to lose so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is already funny as this is getting up again and again in this season .
Bell@@ y@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and remember that Ben@@ net St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
he died down his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ y@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he &apos;ll take care of a sh@@ re@@ ck on it .
but now he has a team that can play and see what we &apos;re looking exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of player .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , making them playing like this .
I build a stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ y@@ ar@@ ola also pointed out that the game Storm at Roo@@ ster achiev@@ es a higher result than the game of Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our play , but is this an Ex@@ c@@ iting game ?
or are breaks , and do not point a ten@@ sion@@ ing point ?
for me it is the maps .
when they mention , it means that in a phase we will meet yet .
the Storm team has free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales begin starting next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with 200,000 tons of deposit according to drug an@@ age
a man , who may possibly face a lifel@@ ong sentence due to his experiment , to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine who was pu@@ zz@@ led to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police took 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly lifel@@ ong punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café might have been from a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Pro@@ agan , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; stated the court on Wednesday .
in the pen@@ al matter he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ ort .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollar as security together to achieve its release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ os statements made by the two people it is clear that the edition of a 200,000 dollar represents a real financial burden , &quot; Mr Richter flan@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from it , not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , among the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass , who announces himself by the police on a daily basis and comm@@ itting himself to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : driving house done apart
at a rear @-@ end with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry lor@@ ry has been badly injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three cars involved had slow@@ ed down in the direction of a permanent assembly in the direction of Basel .
the third driver re@@ marked it too late and tried in vain , to differ in the last moment to the left as the police over@@ l@@ acked .
the under@@ age of the in@@ genu@@ ity tear completely apart .
the driver was badly injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours until 2 pm .

Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used phone of girl to make ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophil@@ es used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the phone of the girl when this was asleep , logged into an online Mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ ep@@ y Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and al@@ armed immediately her mother .
the police took care of it and watched the five pictures , analyzed then computers that were found at the address and discovered the &quot; Web research that used for the search for im@@ permanent pictures of children .
Ho@@ g@@ g said to the officers , that he would have done it because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; and he then promised to be a co@@ p to sc@@ are them . &quot;
the pro@@ secutor E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addiction that he is addic@@ tive to sc@@ are people .
he gave to me that the search performed on the computer was carried out by him , but said it is to happen , because he wanted to claim a co@@ p to exc@@ ite ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did so to l@@ ure them .
he said he is sick of his head , when he drinks , he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the tre@@ mb@@ ling and in the wine .
she then saw the decent pictures on the phone , and confron@@ ting the def@@ endants .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused of his computer and Playstation used to speak to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded not guilty to the charges of the indictment to have rejected in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year and not to have appeared before judgment at a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , since they argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in his failure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ ri@@ ch@@ ael dev@@ out whether the certificate &apos;s judgement until October in order to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ g@@ g was granted security in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other circumstances still in custody .
he was still recorded before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
smug@@ gling soft to small border transi@@ tions to Germany
more and more refugees are being picked up at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks made out of fear of discovery and capture the people more often at smaller bor@@ der@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees were picked up along the border river Inn .
they were walking on bridges and bar@@ ley on the German side .
there they are transferred by Federal Police in reception and sent to the registration .
at the Munich railway station , according to federal police details , more refugees met once again on Wednesday during the weekend starts on Wednesday .
until 8 : 00 p.m. , approximately 700 people are arrived in the state capital , &quot; a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city had reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : sp@@ un by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tro@@ phy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the South@@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm @-@ mon@@ opo@@ lies in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to deep pressure @-@ pressure across Western Europe currents currently warm sea air in the country , the German weather service ( D@@ W@@ D ) in Stuttgart with .
the vigor@@ ous tu@@ ief is the sp@@ urs of the Tro@@ ms@@ man &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn over the past few days by the Bermuda Islands .
heavy storms and Thunder@@ storms are expected primarily in Baden .
according to D@@ W@@ D is still due to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ b Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ seek@@ er with Bö@@ s from 60 to 90 hour @-@ kilometers .
on Friday the sun can no longer be seen .
the mass does it : every two years the car@@ makers will show their novel@@ ties at the IA@@ A .
2015 is to be noted above all in the compact car fleet , which currently sell very well .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were falling according to the power station ( KBA ) alone in August at this segment .
this is also reflected on the IA@@ A ( audience 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept autom@@ obil@@ es and new luxury cars , many new comp@@ act@@ models are presented in this year .
one of the biggest Premi@@ ers for the German Autobahn project is the Opel A@@ stra , who will be at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; the A@@ stra Award is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel &apos;s Chief Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the exhibition .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order that the volume model is also well sold , the new A@@ stra model is also not much more expensive .
Opel provides an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in the view , which starts at 17 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs € 16 9@@ 90 .
the A@@ stra has a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 horse@@ power .
the Hessen H@@ esse has further diesel engines and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp to those for the first time also three @-@ cylinder pet@@ rol engines .
unlike the most important ri@@ vals VW Golf and Ford Focus , there is the Opel A@@ stra first only as a fifth .
a second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible at the IA@@ A .
and what next to the A@@ stra on the IA@@ A still drive new comp@@ act@@ di@@ tos ?
Renault Les gan@@ e : Renault chic the fourth generation of his A@@ stra competition Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only shown as a fi@@ dd@@ ler in a conventional and a fascinating sport GT version .
in trade it enters the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan family wants to find its position in the heavily growing segment with the new model .
thereby , the compact Infin@@ iti fits with its curved lines fully into the design principle of the brand .
the basic model will get a pet@@ rol motor with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
however , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 PS .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , among them a newly developed 1.@@ 0 @-@ liter tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and a power of 82 kW / 111 PS .
the maximum torque is after manufacturing information at 170 New@@ t@@ meters ( N@@ m ) .
sales launch of Bal@@ eno in Europe is spring 2016 .

on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n desc@@ ends above all hand at the front parti@@ san . here the Cooler Master was drawn new and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
inside , above all the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons are reduced by a touch@@ screen and is the first Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
added together at the IA@@ A in the compact class , a series of acquisitions and new variants such as the premiere of Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cell are deserted
the Federal Constitutional Court has been granted to an ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary en@@ voy Te@@ gel , where a month @-@ per is housed in a small cell .
because of the violation of their dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation , if they are housed into small cells .
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
however , those affected can still hope for money if only a few days they were locked in confined spaces ( AZ . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommodated in the detention facility Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell of around five square meters of floor ; the toilet was sp@@ il@@ ely separated .
after that , the man , who is now again walked again on an open cell according to the information of his lawyer , had been reloc@@ ated to a larger cell .
his minister@@ ial cl@@ age due to un@@ worthy adhesi@@ on against the country Berlin was stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly .
but the Constitutional Court lifted the verdi@@ ct of the chamber law in Berlin and rejected the case for renewed test .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
Kammer@@ court decided now about the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons from the questionable period only a few days of liability for the compensation , a compens@@ ate was given , it meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a bon@@ ding of the protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber of the chamber is now to clear the height of the sanctions .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dge often have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
they said that they spoke in the April of a prisoner , dem@@ nity offset , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy of a decision in 2011 is also according to the multi @-@ disciplinary arrangement of a cell without separate toilet .
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court to an in@@ mate attack in November 2009 in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the se@@ wage purification stage was held from 15 to 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours at the same cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were in the head@@ lines during the last weeks as well .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness turn up , even to pun@@ ches it should have come because of the tense situation .
according to information from the Federal Ministry of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young people , 19 shall exp@@ ire in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany to forecasts of the German Federal Ministry in this year , following statement by vice @-@ Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) revealed in the face of the unusual challenge , &quot; I say again and again : we can create this , and we can create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
needed after different forecasts of 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - and the next five years is for the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as it has been built before ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
also the lack of living space is more dramatic , but above all in affordable ten@@ ets : each year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 thousand apartments come out from the rental price , and for these particularly affordable housing will also apply for refugees .
the Federal Minister for Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) intends to double the promotion , of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
too little too little is this from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 thousand welfare apartments have to be created annually , and the federal government should invest an advancement of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; members and federal ministries agreed that there will also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the estimates of the Institute of labour market and vocational research , it is assumed that 55 percent of the refugees are being employed in Germany over the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not ask for their qualification systematically in order to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but for the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the relief organisation , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , migr@@ atory researchers Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ al@@ hardt in Germany it has given a political turn@@ around : from the Work@@ ban on Refu@@ ge@@ es to receive recognition of labor .
while it was formerly a working ban for asylum seekers between up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as does the residences of asylum , the asylum seekers have been restricted to a residence .
the fact is - even because of the lack of qualified labour , has consistently argued that refugees should be enabled quicker to go to the labour market .
there is a major hur@@ dle to access the labour market have a lack of German knowledge .
until now there is still no adequate offer on general and job @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore a view from Thr@@ än@@ hardt in the Königs@@ weg path for labour integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees give their children to the kit@@ ten , estimated at least ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ minded parents , it is only once very important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management of handles in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ator rise strongly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about by carrying more specialist schools .
in the countries students are prepared without German knowledge of welcome classes .
but they are not always instructed by fully trained teachers , teachers , but as in Berlin , even by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ eps from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
principal , no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or thr@@ ul@@ fed the study - the only exception was Berlin , Interior Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees could be facilitated by access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a residence or d@@ ul@@ tification do not receive achievements based on asylum seekers , if they start studying .
the latter will generally not get the BA@@ Fö@@ G as they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ici@@ ous@@ people .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany so far to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G eligible to shor@@ tens this span to 15 months .
but this financing does not have to be closed , call Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ ne &apos;s Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will in future play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion is an important part of their identity .
the state ought to succ@@ es@@ sively put down the same rights in Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches law develop into a new state @-@ religions @-@ relationship .
it would also be important to establish a Islamic welfare state , which cares for the new arri@@ vals .
rights are also obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear point of contact and be ready to work with the state in many areas and to give some control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes a willingness to address religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ker@@ k , vo@@ iced the concern about religious conflicts could also be registered according to Germany .
those who have had such conflicts in Germany have immediately got their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk .
he proposed to translate the Basic La@@ ws on Arab .
integration will be much more still a subject of the whole society in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany indeed - as a result of European decisions - has been a anti @-@ discrimination post and a general gender equality law since a decade ago .
but it slowly learns how the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ series showed , in the police and authorities that were systematically ignored the rac@@ ist image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and stakeholders have long been calling for international treaties such as the anti @-@ racial discrimination , must become reality in the coming years , if the country remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their ways - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally speaking , Germany is able to provide the previously anticipated refugees in medi@@ cally speaking , says the president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tages@@ spiegel deri@@ ve the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this is necessary extra money to flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all early arri@@ vals are equal in the registration of health types .
brought services could be rec@@ laimed later with the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long run , it is highly questionable as many people are available with the limited performance catalogue , which sees the asylum seekers .
otherwise the doctors will primarily make sense of language barriers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even so far , the Berlin scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de proved that immigrants are worse informed about their disease than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only in clinics , also in medical offices it would have to be bar@@ red av@@ ista costs , they are demanding .
in addition , many refugees would have been helped with more general medical questions in the emergency patient .
and with a different diagnostic view .
under refugee quot@@ as , approximately I give it significantly more un@@ dealt with disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
with the partially other disease pictures , German doctors came from their training , but it means Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as regards water shortage , the refugees may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have been a highly developed educational system , several refugees even doctors .
to practice them , however , they must verify its qualifications and remain useful for ex@@ change@@ ably further testing .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany are mentally ill for the post office ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ compul@@ sive disorder or depression .
very vulnerable , refugee &apos;s in@@ der , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study of the Technical University Munich ranks that each fifth Syrian refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who is suffering from a post@@ injury treatment is suffering from among others at so @-@ called flas@@ hing by air@@ mail , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart p@@ aced and death problems .
more symptoms are sleeping and concentr@@ ates disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to avoid that symptoms would be chron@@ ically acceptable , is an early treatment required , stated Mun@@ z .
however , far , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill @-@ sick refugees get a psycho@@ therapy .
indeed , mentally ill @-@ sick asylum seekers can face an application for a Psycho@@ therapy , but the processing usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly experts or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological disorders , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mal@@ in@@ estim@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream

Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Afri@@ el@@ dest leader , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread about the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death @-@ threats and warned them from joining by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ er said that seven op@@ positions @-@ politicians can have received SMS messages on their cell phones which they waiting to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members elected by the Parliament and as soon as they leave the Parliament , parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the boss @-@ speaker said that the party guided by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will be up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP is later split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and services business .
the expected job reductions will lead to a load of over $ 2.@@ 7 billion from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will allow a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who shall lead the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and focused on as it is HP today and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will assist companies to transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; focusing on the provision of previously un@@ ri@@ dden , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it shares a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems and its Palo Alto garage , the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley .
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to tackle the coming from traditional PCs into mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focuss@@ ed on companies generating better performance .
FC Arsenal &apos;s Captain Mi@@ cle Art@@ eta states that team @-@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play it before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly be missed for at least the next four games for England and in view of its history his involvement is certainly still uncertain in the next summer on the European Championship .
the big shame of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate chamber of breaking and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone , which is not well healed .
it is not a big matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his buttons , or with the wounds that he had before .
this may be true from pure medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there are the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he has also played in only 65 of arsen@@ al of arsen@@ al @-@ 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider image for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight gam@@ ti@@ des since 2007 / 08 have been one of the first Premier League clubs , which have had the most offen@@ ding stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have an an@@ gled period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and gain strength . &quot; L@@ ess said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will undergo a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane in the upcoming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents itself with a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players the need to get a small bre@@ ather . &quot; L@@ ess said .
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites , through group F continues , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is among the play@@ grounds with the biggest intimi@@ dation in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by a earthquake , where on the Richter scale 3.@@ 2 were measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the teaching from the last season with the Champions League of Monaco and remains by far @-@ being hope to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive has immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never folded in arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons to men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more des@@ perate than ever before , as su@@ icide attacks among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ berg ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched existence ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek assistance when they need these .
friendship is the heart of the battle to master the challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms demonstrated that when the pas@@ sions had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of recovery are doubled .
for those who are not depressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
in the age of more than social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the inv@@ inci@@ bility of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even when in reality dominates isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by which psych@@ ologists extr@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focusing on the head was placed .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which shines through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing football in cozy ses@@ ri@@ ps and the longing of Ross after Rachel - all that came from knowing that men can relate to it even if they often go back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as members of the phone staff explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my hear@@ ers for people who feel depressed and su@@ icide , made me really clearly show how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come over with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling of being perceived as a weakness if you speak about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term gains and mechanisms .
it presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status about the phone will help people in eye sight the despair also may help to get long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you want to visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends for a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you &apos;re sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship might be .
friends will be broadcast at Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - throughout the 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G in Malmö to rent
angel Di Maria celebrates by Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Iv@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hits on Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to take part in Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Sam@@ son Cav@@ ani held course , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain earned his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the prince &apos;s Park on Tuesday started .
in Mary , less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G players who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised its lead , when Cav@@ ani had reached a head@@ ball@@ ad in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes a strong start against the Swedish Master , since they asp@@ ire not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ on , but an improvement on the path to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs left chances above the gate . he was later released in the game against his hometown team and against the club , with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to gain at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , our opponents have trouble to cause and relax at ease , even if there are certain things that we have to be perf@@ ecting in the course of the season . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret we have not yet scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was held on weekends a 2 : 2 draw on their own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was released in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing @-@ stor@@ my was designated as the man , the PS@@ G was taken to the next stage in Europe , and he clari@@ fies why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he finished Johan Wil@@ and past in the long corner of the grid .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would be a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic eff@@ ected in an play @-@ off to reach this level joined with an@@ ff with nine national play@@ mates in the field and was faced with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle base ha@@ ded a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who pass far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself was sometimes on , with some mis@@ ses and bad deals , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was pat@@ ched on no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the start .
yet he pointed a lot more skill when he got his te@@ amm@@ ers into the game and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic that turned Di Maria to a swi@@ vel cut which was subject to the post @-@ pole in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay was thus achieving his sixth seasonal sh@@ tor , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts on that Malmö could come back to the game , and only an excellent interference by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi on a door@@ way at the end .
the coaches of Malmö , Age Har@@ ling , later announced that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European Champion X@@ avi plays since summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who was then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times of Spanish Master , three times Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger , four times champion Champions League , two times European champion , one time champion - the titles list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer of the year 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
yet in an interview with the Mar@@ ca ski@@ pped X@@ avi now that he was already standing before the Euro 2008 in front of the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered well as FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ ach took over FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the differenti@@ ating man for this today works for the German record master : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has captured Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under the contract and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P said to me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he has rejected me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s play season 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi would have been running .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League to the Bavaria about the whole distance on the lawn , weigh@@ ed the red aus ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end to the royal division .

as a result of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light broke the experienced actor Brown , acting as the need for alternative perspectives , while in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the selected screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , do it during the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of an actor of The Mar@@ tian is fir@@ med .
Dam@@ on and Brown closed the producer @-@ mates Ben aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the Show @-@ Fin@@ alist .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a gro@@ ute , who is beaten by her white stri@@ ls .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the Director @-@ rights to the film ; Dam@@ on testi@@ fied that their direction &quot; in the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;

professional @-@ clim@@ bers and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ with home .
the contest show , which completed just their 7th season , had never experienced a competition party , which could complete all the steps of its obstacle course .
during the end @-@ end , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the final .
the last task was climbing to a 75 foot long climbing path in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended the task within the time he had the first athlete , who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Ninja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge every three seconds more quickly , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock reaching the profit of the Big Prize of 1 million $ .
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never had more than 10,000 $ or had a life , &quot; says Isaac E ! about his bunch of money .
so suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Report to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten , although first at all ended the course , did not get any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , they get the one at the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
as much the money is a wonderful price and life changed , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe he is still a gro@@ ove about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received numerous awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am happy that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just that if they had transp@@ osed the roles .
America Ninja Warri@@ or was extended for a series of eas@@ el , the filming will commence in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past the Minnesota T@@ wins

&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ fighting every game , and so I want to concentrate on the game .
the nomin@@ ee tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three results and was in two of us , his first R@@ B@@ Is since the middle of August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked the wood as well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sh@@ us@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the neck training ) , and saw distinc@@ tly better from the Bull@@ ard , and he got it straight into the deck .
with three beats in the rear at the end of the seventh Inn@@ es the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .

with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second brought Al@@ hagen the third Bas@@ epp@@ ner Tre@@ vor to a Double Play .
this was the first in the major league for the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ sts hit a double Play .
after Detroit was added at the end of the ne@@ down@@ turn , the Wall managed an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .

the tig@@ ators gained three R@@ us in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veteran , who had been rep@@ ain@@ ted before the game of the injury list , after it had been missing for more than one month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt comfortable when I set off and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after they got in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , K@@ mer@@ ry gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , who managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .

Ischgl : German military intervention in Syria an option
the Munich &apos;s head of Munich &apos;s safety conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for an occasion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that decisive night thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw out the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago one was glad that the Kel@@ ch of a military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict desc@@ ends outside our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid at the local refugees .
Austria controls the south and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has once again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Presidency of Johanna Heu@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station OR@@ F , according to Hungary I will now be sent back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also Germany did not send refugees to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she declared .
according to the question of an agreement , in which Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I have already given discussions between the Director @-@ General for Public Safety and representatives in Germany .
concrete numbers called her not and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days , tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so @-@ called bal@@ kan@@ ians from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for the next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU ministers will aim to take on a special start to the binding distribution of more 120 000 refugees on a special meeting .
given the strong refugee rescue in Germany the federal government wants to support countries in the first @-@ up and distribution of the people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the offices in Berlin .
Merkel emphas@@ ised , those people who seek shelter , de@@ pl@@ ore them too .
but who did not have a lead perspective , could not stay in Germany .
this concept may have been sub@@ squ@@ ently divided into the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now be able to cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force of force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck on the route route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours on it announced the government in Budapest to block the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour is unlike Serbia on the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent hot head@@ boats over Romania , &quot; said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government exp@@ elled the plan immediately .
there were first im@@ min@@ ts of people that had cut off the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of other migrants reported on the way to the Greek border .

at the purchase , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smells .
the switches alone says nothing about the way the fruit is ripe - so green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be kept at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .

first F@@ ishing tower , then distinctive c@@ tured @-@ front
the coming night breaks down in the valleys of the Alps @-@ north@@ ward of the F@@ öh@@ n , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland on Tuesday closed .
on Wednesday and the night of Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n partly wind up with assault on the mo@@ by @-@ valleys .
after com@@ promis@@ ers on Thursday morning we crossed a distinctive c@@ tured @-@ front that brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind @-@ bu@@ cks and a temperature drop .
as the Met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a message writes , Switzerland is currently on the front of a comprehensive sea @-@ area over the British islands in a vigor@@ ous south @-@ west direction .
at the Alpine rim , the night breaks down the Wednesday of the caves through the valleys .
in the episode , the F@@ öh@@ n continues to Thursday morning in the man@@ t valley with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ it@@ land , partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can pre @-@ penetrate to the adjacent mid@@ position , and on the mountains there are even Or@@ can@@ bu@@ cks of over 120 km / h .
while lying in the north on Wednesday in summer for summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture starts to st@@ ew out of the plain .
here rain is presenting an , who holds up to Thursday nights .
in sum , south of the Alps must be calculated in the next 48 hours with some 100 lit@@ res of rain per square meter , this after the last few days has already fallen by large rain @-@ quantities .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n continues the air , in which episode rolls a cold front with strong , partly we@@ ather@@ ing rain from west to east via Switzerland .

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther &apos;s Square
nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther &apos;s place in Rome .
in the presence of the president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino was bap@@ tised on Wednesday a previously un@@ named place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill , on the name of the German re@@ ali@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was filed by the work@@ community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority often could live only in secret their faith .
the place becomes apparent in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the annual turn 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
then he found the city back then as a sin@@ ner sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions were encouraged by the opinion of historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated with his theses against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del the division of the Russian church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the masterpieces , which was painted by Ot@@ mar Alt in his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and Bible texts has been updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which is now released with gorgeous images .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which was formulated in 150 mo@@ ons his quite personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which , however , is not as important with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lus@@ cious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective subjects are adapted , this can certainly be rather ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked on his Bible @-@ project for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that dedic@@ ate topics such as cru@@ c@@ els , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or father@@ land .
thus he has spontane@@ ously fascinated a number of partners : that applies to the Luther publisher with his the@@ ological orientation as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and it is mainly the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ piano , who dealt with the Bible on the basis of the painting .
he interpreted the Bible @-@ makers from Ot@@ mar Alt and so in Today , in current contexts . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ ale mirror of al@@ ts painting .
embedded they are between the original Bible @-@ biblical from Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who here formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry band has Golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately dis@@ sol@@ vers for the Bible @-@ project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant heritage order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the education was already because of the pi@@ stock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to re@@ work that , in order to bring me again to the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to be more important in art in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of picture @-@ worlds is defined today by advertising and that is loud .
Sy@@ mbo@@ lic is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that the viewer should let the pictures show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show them &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they discover and sense what force they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post conf@@ esses Tuesday in the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art , &quot; I like , as he understands on his pictures . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to respect the Bible properly but the Bible chosen for it is important , even mysterious topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no co @-@ operation on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a pictures of the Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to deepen his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als and paper construc@@ ts - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition presented on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
construction starts for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place was located , company mand@@ ates , board@@ walk for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finally the end again .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration for floo@@ ding , especially in the native people who did not tolerate the train .
so hill de@@ ported to new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval won in October , I was now telling the first church of Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the child@@ ren@@ - and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further mem@@ or@@ pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works in the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundesliga continues to focus a clear sign on weekends .
the football respon@@ ds to the most secure situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the politics his help in coping with the related problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since the reunion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s no man in principle , that doesn &apos;t address me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something interesting to get a handle on this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said G@@ B @-@ Chef Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in the pit office next Wednesday and meet the State &apos;s minister@@ ial minister in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the topic will certainly play a central part , &quot; he announced .
the football could and wants to help .
but the decisive women must put politics down .
the German Bundesliga team is therefore extending its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach , at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Juli@@ an@@ â s / Malta .
also some Bundes@@ lig@@ ists support this programme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend the 36 promot@@ ers put a clear sign , if on the left tri@@ kot@@ är@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) will help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ newspaper ( Tuesday ) , and described the plans for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee &apos;s drama goes every one , no one must be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can have football ( soccer ) , no , we have to use our beam strength , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have so incredibly suffered , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ se managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication against Hungary on this Friday invite the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach noted the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a great common plant in German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ one have started their own projects would have been great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are there active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we have spent will live in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and the next year the association is put together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government for 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already called &apos; the whole amount for 2015 , &apos; told Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
report : SAP @-@ Board of Directors loses an eye in an accident
the Executive Director of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has recently lost his left eye to several reports by a fall in early July .
in the accident at the stair@@ way in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell after midnight on a tum@@ bler lying in his left hand reports on the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is nearly blood@@ shot , being impot@@ ent , then she got out tow@@ ed onto the road - that he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ thin &quot; SAP @-@ founder H@@ asso Plat@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early October we meet in front of the supervisory board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is involved in the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully fit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( thunder@@ storm ) , he will come back in October to Germany and continue to run the software group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was dealing with the Supervisory Board and its chairman H@@ asso Plat@@ n , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
to him it is important to go to the public with such a personal history , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen something like that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you are fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

whether the re@@ us will be back in the Bundesliga to Le@@ verk@@ usen at Sunday leaving the BV@@ B Coach : &quot; we expect a return from it to training on Friday . &quot;
given the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its tribal population on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door position .
therefore , Roman F@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking a place of ancest@@ ry Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained in an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the football teacher the World Champion .
whether women &apos;s turn@@ eller in the future come to use in all European league games , though Tu@@ ck was still open .
with high probability he will also challenge the second game .
the prob@@ abil@@ ty statement of Mit@@ player Re@@ us that the final chance of BV@@ B in the Europe League has to be the target , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l believes : &quot; that is why Marco does not lie so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to drop the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ un@@ tos : government wants to make a rest for Germany
Germany shall be leading by the will of the federal government in the shift in cars of technological fron@@ trun@@ ner .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a Strategic Plan from the House of Transport , Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which provides among other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Autom@@ esse IA@@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less st@@ em@@ bedding , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with the representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
among other things the Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Tourism strongly emphasises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band balance and a generous amount of access to digital radio .
the testing of new technology is currently being created on highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver will not be compensated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional risk of liability &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German federal government wants to verify the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus Germany has to stand for example internationally that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
the German government also wants to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention that is so far available only to people as a driver .
at automated driving , the car is taking over , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data within seconds .
according to a report submitted by the Economic Affairs project , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically possible .
nevertheless , driving less cars on public streets &quot; can be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in the Germany site appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; digital connectivity of passenger cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD &apos;s private poli@@ cem@@ an S@@ ar Bar@@ to@@ l .
the issue of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clear and clear .
but still see the German independent cars un@@ scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday on the AA pre@@ defined survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the audit organization DE@@ K@@ RA will believe that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will start over the next ten years , 32 percent less than in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France accounts for 21 per cent of the respon@@ dents up to 20@@ 25 with self @-@ driven cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to fully depend on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association @-@ glau@@ coma , only seven percent would agree to abandon the control throughout the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway you could still think about 15 percent in flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent .
good everyone by car would not leave the car under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start at ping @-@ p@@ ong @-@ EM
according to current status , the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will only fight in the single market for the title of September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we are strong enough even to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo Schei@@ der , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the German Bundestag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jörg Haider @-@ head during the EM @-@ dive in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time B@@ oll was on the flight with a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing in China .
the 34 year old German champion is rep@@ lic@@ ated on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the downside , we are now no longer such a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; favorite &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated single @-@ European representative Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner who att@@ aches the S@@ etz@@ gen in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg is also reminded of the European Championship in shots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also missing and we are the European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead we should orient@@ ate ourselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the world @-@ driven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant H@@ enny
it is a mixture of very grand fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ pe@@ a cabinet maker : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window man@@ nequins , which is terri@@ fying thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of fashion scene - and therefore , that he put men in the tube .
&quot; I can no longer say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant H@@ enny cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be light , now it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the 18th September to the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung is to be seen , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ pic@@ ter had changed his initially fle@@ eing stance on a vision of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he would have been against it , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , a show was a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made downtown Montreal and in Paris station .
&quot; it is about as much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ es .
it comes to tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits to give an insight into the little still impressive work of the man , which has written the fashion history without ever completed an education .
chron@@ ologically , the vision is not set up , but it is a beautifully chore@@ ograph@@ ed total work , for which a lot of effort was operated : to fres@@ hen the dolls , for example a sty@@ list was engaged .
14 tons of material made the makers according to data of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October legend , there was still a special sho@@ em@@ aker : a leather tro@@ user out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers &apos; old Ted@@ dy is in the exhibition too .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ inian wal@@ lets of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put at his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ HS and clothing , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
with a pupp@@ et to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
the dism@@ iss@@ age of fashion he later joined himself .
he st@@ ole fashion journals and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier was related in Munich .
but I bought it later on .
he did not pay the Mod@@ els for his first own fashion show .
it got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
it used to go to the long nit@@ ro@@ dents in and around afraid to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tops have emerged in a large amount for customers who , for example , they re@@ worked for blankets and she@@ ers .
today , that alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ vies Pl@@ aces .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the beginning of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : head in jewelry , for accessories like bags and in regional costumes .
actually , the so @-@ called vintage mode , which rests on past styles , an increasing customer &apos;s potential .
those who are not operated in the textile industry in Germany is no longer available on the market .
we already have half of all orders in our business .
fashion designer Pl@@ ows is also a member of the branch association with nine other companies at the branch association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of its sales are broken away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; private trade stores and also the wholesale trade there are almost no more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our products can hardly reach the customers on this path .
mass ware are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold on chains .
moreover , weak@@ ling the export , currently to Russia and in the United States .
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to focus on its environmental awareness as Cord@@ ula Bauer accompanies the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we are running a seal of quality , which shows that we are environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt completed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also relates to the used materials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diploma @-@ designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the snail of the West@@ Sax@@ onian University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
to address competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies which need to think economically most economically &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore a existing design is often only slightly different , to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter newly developed the historic snow @-@ top .
they put the machine at some places small chi@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ e@@ de@@ master@@ y Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ds inspired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not do anything with traditional skir@@ t top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now playing the snow@@ ball for her jewellery .
in an elaborate process they shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of pl@@ under - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
she also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors had lived in pl@@ ust and surroundings and who wish to mem@@ ori@@ ze a mem@@ ento .
I view my jewelry as the modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; - Film
legends are not supposed to stir well but Disney is still waiting for a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it goes according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not a novel@@ ty but a kind of continuation that 20 years after the first film plays with the magic child maid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the financial crisis in England .
who is playing P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already clear : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI pus@@ hes out to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must move wider to the outside , to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the reform of reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should enti@@ ce to enti@@ t@@ lement foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the central leadership group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to encourage new start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i .
the leadership group passed a series of guidelines , including a negative result of the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls , politics , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ ystems .
after the statement , a neg@@ ativity @-@ list is created , which identifies sectors and companies that are not into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programmes .
the initiative is of importance because it gives the market a larger role in the division of resources , a legally state business environment and open the market open , &quot; says the statement .
the government will also lo@@ dged checks on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure that companies will decide how they perform their business .
the statement also stated that China will allow China to explore new models of cross @-@ border business co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer , public controlled sectors open , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of non @-@ funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by requ@@ esting the requirements and facilitate the application process .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting also Premier Li M@@ cl@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double up mer@@ cur@@ y limits in predat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double up the threshold values for mer@@ cur@@ y in large predat@@ ors and consumers with it a significantly higher dose of nerve revenues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is an appropriate work paper of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans clearly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side @-@ effects mis@@ led industrial and environmental policies passed with full impact on pregnant and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt by F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt says , therefore the threshold values of the neur@@ is@@ oned fish for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are raised from one to two milli@@ grams of Mercury in kilograms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but big rob@@ bery @-@ fish , however , were so strongly poll@@ uted to mer@@ cur@@ y , that on the basis of the still existing limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cor@@ ds are not allowed to be sold .
after dup@@ lication of the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ negoti@@ able .
in return for this lo@@ vel@@ ing , the EU wants to ti@@ ghten the threshold values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0,@@ 1 milli@@ gram of Mercury per kilo@@ gram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this however as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cemeter@@ ies , such as car@@ p , usually are so low stra@@ ined that they already made the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de of distr@@ action , which alone helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is a po@@ is@@ oned heavy metal , powerful on the food chain , especially in car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government warned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low volumes especially in the bor@@ ro@@ aches of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal state of affairs declared on its home page with regard to the current limits , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
Mercury is mainly transported by coal @-@ burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , German coal fired power plant in Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ buck more than six tons of Mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity in Germany .
the concentration of mer@@ cur@@ y in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had been cited in March in the paper .
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cur@@ y in fish already been among the most common health risks in the EU war@@ es system RA@@ SF@@ F .
