agreement in the form of a brief@@ ing between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the Member States within the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ Z could close stand@@ by credit agreement with central banks of the cred@@ itor when the banks make a relevant request .
the agreement could be closed until the total amount of the cred@@ itor on the mechanism dispos@@ ed to the mechanism , namely within a total limit of 2.7@@ 25 b@@ b@@ illing units ; this is equivalent to 50 % of all future generations of the member states .
however , right now they are listed below for some conditions , to which the BI@@ Z would be ready .
in any stand@@ by credit , BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions resi@@ dences , without which a total of five years will be exceeded .
at the opening of the loans , as well as for the extension of the credits , the BI@@ Z would charge a credit charge .
moreover , the first Zion@@ ists would not be dis@@ continued before a month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments of their own liqui@@ dity .
the Zion@@ ists would have to be made available in the United States at the disposal of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would act under consideration of the funds of the bank , is likely to take three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ Z at the given moment falls on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would have largely correspond to market parag@@ rap@@ hs .
