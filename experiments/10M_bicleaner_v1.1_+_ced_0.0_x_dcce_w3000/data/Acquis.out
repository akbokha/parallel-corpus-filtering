agreement in the form of a brief@@ ing between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the Member States within the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ Z could close stand@@ by credit agreement with central banks of the cred@@ itor when the banks make a relevant request .
the agreement could be closed until the total amount of the cred@@ itor on the mechanism dispos@@ ed to the mechanism , namely within a total limit of 2.7@@ 25 b@@ b@@ illing units ; this is equivalent to 50 % of all future generations of the member states .
however , right now they are listed below for some conditions , to which the BI@@ Z would be ready .
in any stand@@ by credit , BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions resi@@ dences , without which a total of five years will be exceeded .
at the opening of the loans , as well as for the extension of the credits , the BI@@ Z would charge a credit charge .
moreover , the first Zion@@ ists would not be dis@@ continued before a month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments of their own liqui@@ dity .
the Zion@@ ists would have to be made available in the United States at the disposal of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would act under consideration of the funds of the bank , is likely to take three or six months .

the community in@@ sured that New Zealand with this agreement should not be prevented by using new technological developments , or sustain its competitive position on the market of the community .
should a change of the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , then consult the two sub@@ contractors each other before introducing such a change in cl@@ ause 10 mentioned committees to find a proper solution .
taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agree that any actual application of funds or other sponsors for the export of h@@ amm@@ ers and lam@@ bs , as well as for the s@@ laughter particular living sheep and lam@@ bs are carried out only at prices and conditions which are consistent with the existing international commitments and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these produce .
the committee constantly checks the tendency on the Hamm@@ el , lam@@ b and Go@@ at car@@ vers of the two parties , and on the world market as well as the terms of terms on these markets , including the conditions , which are of importance to the cl@@ ause 7 @-@ mentioned objectives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly suggest that your government can agree to the above , that this letter and your answers together constitute an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ad@@ ore myself to tell you that my government can agree to the subject , and that your letter and reply will form a deal according to your suggestion .
in the form of a brief@@ ing between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Eastern Europe about trading of Hamm@@ el and Lamb .
I ad@@ ore me to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish regulations regarding the import of h@@ amm@@ el - , lam@@ b and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations the two parties have agreed :
- fresh or cool@@ ed h@@ amm@@ el - , lam@@ b and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ stelle 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common customs tariff ) ;
- frozen Hamm@@ el - , Lamb - and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ stelle 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Joint tariff tariff ) .
under this agreement the export possibilities for h@@ amm@@ el - , lam@@ b and goat meat from Uruguay to the community on the following annual amount are fixed :
in order to ensure a f@@ law@@ less functioning of the deal , Uruguay to ensure through suitable procedures that the fact in fact led the agreed amount not exce@@ eds and under the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .
should a change of the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , then the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before introducing a change in the number 10 mentioned committees to find a proper solution .
in the event that the community particip@@ ates the protective cl@@ ause , it is obliged to bear the concern that in this agreement , ac@@ claim is not touched to the common market in this agreement .
in the event that imports from Uruguay will exceed the agreed amounts , the community reserves the right to ex@@ pose the imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the community comm@@ its itself , the exhau@@ st@@ ion on the import of the products made by this agreement on a test@@ ic@@ ile of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ o@@ rem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when joining new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay is changing the number 2 fixed quantities corresponding to the extent of the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the import of import for these new Member States will set in compliance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; here the number 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ satz of the exhau@@ st@@ ion is taken into account .
the total number of the total of the total number is set with the day of accession to the community to 5 800 tons of batt@@ lements .
the community is taking everything to avoid a market development which could inter@@ f@@ ere the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen Hamm@@ el and Lamb on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community meets arrangements , so that the paragraph of intervention stocks of frozen meat due to the execution of Regulation adopted by ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an Schaff@@ le@@ isch .
taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agree that any actual application of funds or other sponsors for the export of h@@ amm@@ ers and lam@@ bs , as well as for the s@@ laughter particular living sheep and lam@@ bs are carried out only at prices and conditions which are consistent with the existing international commitments and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these produce .
these terms are compatible in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ ATT and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal inch and trade agreement .
in particular , Uruguay guarantees the compliance of this agreement , in particular that it will be issued in the quantities specified in this agreement on the number 1 products stated in this agreement .
the community comm@@ its itself to meet all the necessary arrangements , so that the issu@@ ance of in@@ feed licenses depend on the proposal made in Uruguay by the template of a export @-@ license which is given to the present place by the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an government .
in terms of policy regulations , it is also defined that the relevant ur@@ u@@ gu@@ an authority in the competent office of the community has been granted in regular intervals , for the export @-@ licens@@ ing to un@@ lock the amounts if necessary for identification purposes .
this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the basis of such agreement on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Eastern Uruguay on the other hand .
it is valid till 31 March 1984 ; after that time it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to cancel it with a notice period of one year in writing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be checked by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes , which they are necessary to consider . &quot; &quot; &quot;
