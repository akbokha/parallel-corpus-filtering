it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that are dis@@ solved in the mouth ) as a solution to the deposit ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection resolution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ l thinking and Spe@@ ech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a psychological disorder , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( Peri@@ ods an@@ or@@ m@@ aler Hoch@@ stimmung ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe to severe man@@ ic episodes , and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients suffering from the past to the drug .
the inj@@ ecting solution is applied for quick control of conf@@ isc@@ ated un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral in@@ gest@@ ion of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to the entry or the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets can be applied in patients with the gor@@ ge of tablets difficulties .
in patients who simultaneously take other medicines that are just as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol probably works primarily as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters appears to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role , carries Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and will prevent their re@@ occur .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent the re@@ perc@@ ussions of symptoms , was investigated in three studies until one year .
the effectiveness of the inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizop@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases that compared to conf@@ lic@@ ted un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was rati@@ fied over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ eri@@ l , in a different study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , to prevent re@@ perc@@ ussions in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was carried out in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which suffered from in@@ ei@@ ving un@@ rest , with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change in symptoms of patients were based on a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering from the treatment .
the company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body re@@ im@@ bur@@ ns the mel@@ ting @-@ tray and the solution to the incorpor@@ ation .
in the two studies with the inj@@ ecting solution showed patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in d@@ oses of 5,25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms gest@@ ant in@@ ag@@ itation than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decreased Abi@@ li@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies are more effective than plac@@ ebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also fet@@ tered up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the re@@ occur man@@ ic episodes carried out during previously treated patients and if it was administ@@ ered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg cans were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms gest@@ ed un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy on the entry ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ am@@ id@@ ale interference ( un@@ control@@ l@@ eness ) , tre@@ mor ( sle@@ y ) , anxiety , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , sali@@ va hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( enhanced sali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) launched to the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schizop@@ hr@@ enia , and in prevention of a new Ott@@ oman episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol said to weigh on the risks .
moreover , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the inj@@ ecting solution in quick control of conf@@ lic@@ ated un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with schizop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable towards the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission divided the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union .
ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new Ott@@ oman episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended inc@@ le@@ osis for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in d@@ osing over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dosage .
the recommended initial dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schizop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients aged 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower Initi@@ ation osis should be considered clinical factors ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Indu@@ tractor is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ icide behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after the change of an anti @-@ psychological therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased Su@@ icide disorder with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ic medication .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be applied with caution among patients with known cardiovascular disease , cardi@@ ac in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , respir@@ atory disorders , conditions , which are applied for hyp@@ ot@@ onie ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which received a year or less persistent , there were occasi@@ onal reports of during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol mut@@ ing dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
when in one with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient appears signs and symptoms , which imp@@ aired to a m@@ ns , or in@@ clear high fe@@ ver without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , must be abol@@ ished all the anti@@ psych@@ ic medication , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with coron@@ ary cases in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are used with cr@@ amp@@ ments which are used with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , an elevated risk to plac@@ ebo .
there was however , in one of these studies , a study with fix@@ ing Dos@@ age , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted fe@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol @-@ treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ onale or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients suffering with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essm@@ ents for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related inci@@ dents in with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic medication @-@ treated patients who permit direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ uri@@ e , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels .
a weight gain is generally seen in schizop@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medication where weight gain is known as a side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines that may be taken as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a stomach acid @-@ blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ p@@ ation rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , however this effect is regarded as clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy pro@@ st@@ agn@@ ates a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chinese inhibit@@ or ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % , while the C@@ max stayed unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ oxet@@ ine and par@@ oxet@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be done similar tin reductions .
with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ izing , the common application can result with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher pl@@ asma @-@ CPU compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ext@@ ensi@@ onal Met@@ abol@@ isation .
if you take into account the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be done similar tin reductions .
after st@@ ating the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors should be lifted the dosage of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y to the dosage prior to the beginning of the term therapy .
Dil@@ an@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administ@@ ered together with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical studies revealed C@@ ans from 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol per day no significant effect on the met@@ abolic disorders of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ext@@ ro@@ meth@@ am@@ an @-@ Rati@@ o ) , 2C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ext@@ ro@@ meth@@ amine ) .
the patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the insufficient data base for the safety of people and because of the concerns raised in reproduction , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits do not produce the potential risk to the fet@@ us .
however , even in other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients should be warned of , dangerous machines , including fuel vehicles , to operate , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol have no negative impact .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as potential medic@@ ally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the below listed side effects is defined after the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schizop@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total of reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ismus , Ak@@ ha@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with semi @-@ eri@@ l ( 57,@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % amo@@ unted to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS increased by 14.@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled trial over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53,@@ 3 % in patients under half @-@ term treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % amo@@ unted to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium @-@ treatment .
during long term savings phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo on which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medic@@ ally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.@@ 0 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and Kr@@ amp@@ fan@@ cies , undes@@ irable events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia people , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the launch of un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal anti@@ do@@ si@@ dings were acci@@ dentally observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone in adult patients with estimated d@@ oses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information about the effectiveness of a her@@ es@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of exagger@@ ation with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; however , it is unlikely that Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis is produced in the treatment of an over@@ di@@ zation of benefits , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is a high pl@@ asma connection .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is convey@@ ed with schizop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a particip@@ ative influence on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ rep@@ ent@@ or and to the Hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
with gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in d@@ oses from 0,5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy pro@@ b@@ anden , the Pos@@ it@@ ons em@@ ission @-@ shar@@ ehol@@ m showed a dose @-@ dependent decline of the bond of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , an D2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ or league , on the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and cru@@ ising .
in three Plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schizop@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to plac@@ ebo a statist@@ ically significant increase of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ d@@ re @-@ controlled trial was 52 of the proportion of respon@@ dence to patients who were talking about the study media , in both groups similar to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from mess@@ sc@@ ales , which were defined as secondary study , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants , showed a significant stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ d@@ l .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizop@@ hr@@ enia showed themselves a significant higher reduction of back@@ install@@ ment , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study conducted at schizop@@ hr@@ z@@ ol ( N = 18 or 13 % of valuable patients ) with significantly less patient a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output ( i.e. an increase from at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of approx .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a over plac@@ ebo excessive effectiveness in reducing real symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fix@@ ing dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol against plac@@ ebo no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ y and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies on 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a compared to plac@@ ebo excessive effectiveness in week 3 and a cl@@ ue effect that was comparable to that of li@@ thium , or half @-@ eri@@ or in week 12 .
in week Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also proved to be a compar@@ ative proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie on how li@@ thium and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic properties , which partly over 2 weeks not on li@@ thi@@ ans or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapie in Therap@@ y Ser@@ um@@ mirror , found the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a superior effectiveness in reducing real symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabil@@ isation phase before Rand@@ om@@ isation showed themselves Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol against plac@@ ebo largely considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ im@@ et , predomin@@ antly in preventing a back into the man@@ ie .
based on vit@@ ro @-@ studies , the enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ction of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , which is cat@@ aly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .

in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ op@@ tics between male and female healthy Pro@@ b@@ anden , as well as a pharmac@@ ological investigation of schizop@@ hren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a specific analysis to pharmaceutical macro ine@@ tics found no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin , or the effect of smoking on pharmac@@ etics from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ological characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
an un@@ le@@ osis study at Pro@@ b@@ anden ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study com@@ prised only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to pull out conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane has been studied in a main study , attended by 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had received a anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine in three quarters .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ ay@@ ana or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the treatment of a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in combination ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
in total , in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with abra@@ sion untreated patients were treated to the treatment , towards 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients , which received conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el black@@ ish drugs .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between drugs and survival for the deteri@@ oration of disease and survival .
it showed themselves in patients who previously received other treatments in their metastatic breast cancer , with regard to these indicators that myst@@ ic@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el soft@@ ening medicine .
it may also not be applied with patients , the breast@@ feeding or before the start of the treatment low Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ dent removal in the blood .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) realized that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with which the first treatment was no longer preventing , more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el soft@@ ening medicine was not given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission part@@ ed the company Abra@@ xis Bios@@ cience Limited A approval for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed to the treatment of metastatic mamm@@ ak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma in patients in which the first @-@ line treatment is failed for metastatic disease ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie ) ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ . &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or heavy sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy during the abra@@ sion therapy should be reduced in the subsequent series to 220 mg / m2 .
at sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy degree 3 is the treatment to break up until a improvement to level 1 or 2 is achieved , and in all subsequent cycles a dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies conducted with patients with com@@ promised kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to sufficient data to be thought@@ fulness and effectiveness .

if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated once again with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients there should be no renewed abrasive treatment cycles , until the Ne@@ ut@@ rom@@ phil@@ ately has risen to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ ist has risen up to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly identified with Abra@@ x@@ ane in relation related cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity has not been proven , kar@@ di@@ ale inci@@ dents in the inde@@ xed patient stret@@ chers are not un@@ common , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine treatment or imp@@ aired cardi@@ ac disease or ham@@ ic disease .

male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sperm activation , because by therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause effects of fatigue ( very frequently ) and verti@@ go ( common ) , which can impact on the traffic and ability to operate machinery .
in the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects shown in 229 patients with metastatic mamm@@ ak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ sion .
Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most remarkable important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( if 79 % of patients reported ) and was quick rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( HB &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the patients with abrasive patients and was severe in three cases ( HB &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects are specified in connection with the Gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy with any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .

p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ c@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules substance , which promotes the cont@@ amination of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tubes of the tubes and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by in@@ hibition of their deport@@ ation .
these stabil@@ isation leads to a im@@ itation of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network that is essential for the vital practice phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in the Trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ ma@@ om@@ pon@@ ents being convey@@ ed in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells and in the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in the transportation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el promotes the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells .

the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic mamm@@ ak@@ ar@@ gal@@ om is supported by data of 106 patients in two sing@@ ular studies and 4@@ 54 patients , which were treated in a random@@ ised phase @-@ III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients were treated with metastatic mamm@@ ak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of inf@@ usion of 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion to 63 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centr@@ alised study carried out in patients with metastatic Mamm@@ ac@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of sol@@ vent with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion to the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ media ( N = 229 ) .
when taking into the study 64 % of patients had a dis@@ counted general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al met@@ ast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ al models .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % only had a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and for adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement by a degree for patients who were evaluated at a time during therapy a periph@@ eral N@@ europ@@ athy degree 3 .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for ending on Bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatments were not evaluated and is still unknown .
the Pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics of the entire p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute ill@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was established in clinical trials .

the clearing of Pac@@ ar@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after a sol@@ vent @-@ powered p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el inj@@ ecting and also the mani@@ fol@@ ine volume was at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies of human micro@@ vitamins and tissues , the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily attributed to 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .

controlled clinical trials have no significant benefits shown on the gift of ep@@ o@@ ins , when the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ o@@ centr@@ ation is enhanced about the concentration of ana@@ esthe@@ tic symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions required .
the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ binder @-@ rise should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minim@@ ise the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evidence in@@ suffici@@ ency should in@@ suffici@@ ency in@@ suff@@ ice that in Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin target cannot be exceeded .
after the present findings , the treatment of ana@@ emia with ep@@ o@@ in al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of kidney failure is not acceler@@ ated .
for tum@@ ults under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ in @-@ al@@ fa @-@ G@@ abe and the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in response can be considered ( patients who may be trans@@ cribed ) .
if the HB @-@ increase is bigger than 2 g / dl ( 9,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a HB @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ wer @-@ conditional an@@ emia ; dosage adjustment with the aim of holding the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ ine value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a utility risk considering the patient &apos;s participation which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger det@@ ective surgery should , if possible , before the beginning of the ep@@ o@@ in @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy , the cause of ana@@ emia examined and treated accordingly .
patients who under@@ go to a larger det@@ ecti@@ vit@@ ae , should have an appropriate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly with an underlying cardiovascular disease .
moreover , it cannot be ruled that in treatment with ep@@ o@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a starting @-@ mo@@ glo@@ omy of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk for post@@ operative arthritis / vas@@ cular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , in several controlled trials , they have not proven to survive in tum@@ our patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia ; or reduce the risk of tum@@ our patients .

the most common side @-@ effect during the treatment with ep@@ o@@ in al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .

survival and tum@@ ors were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blinds of plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ ed studies and

in these studies revealed in the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in treated patients with an an@@ emia due to several more frequent mal@@ ign@@ ts consistent with an un@@ clar@@ ified , statist@@ ically significant higher mort@@ ality than with controls .
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thy@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and thus related complications in combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in treated patients and at inspec@@ tions .
there is an increased risk for th@@ chro@@ bo@@ em@@ atic events in tum@@ our patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results relate to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in in tum@@ our patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ary among 13 g / dl , since too few patients were included with these characteristics in the aud@@ ited data .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after the men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high carrier risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a low trau@@ mat@@ ous hip , as in the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the fem@@ ur , a disease , which changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip consumed should be a great dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) , or by inj@@ ecting a muscle .
the administration of par@@ ap@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the pain , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the MOR@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta should be used only by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the substance in A@@ cl@@ asta the same is like in Zom@@ eta , a part of the dat@@ as material was used for Zom@@ eta to assess the A@@ cl@@ asta .
during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of sp@@ inal and joints were examined over a period of three years .
the second study com@@ prised 2 127 men and women with ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a fat@@ fac@@ et ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ ate ) .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was , whether the content of the al@@ kal@@ ine ph@@ osph@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me , the bone substance grows ) in blood again norm@@ alized or at least 75 % over the output .
the trial with older women was reduced the risk of sp@@ las@@ ms in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis density ) over a period of three years compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other ost@@ e@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ m ) with those under plac@@ ebo the risk of gir@@ ders was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with rice , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta a fraction ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repe@@ ating inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta should not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other Bis@@ phosph@@ ates or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to inf@@ usion and ost@@ e@@ age rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides clearing material to physicians to use the A@@ cl@@ asta to treat e@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material to patients in which the side effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis and ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis in men a intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta once a year is recommended .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ mat@@ ism , the administration of inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks is recommended after the operating supply of the hips ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the MOR@@ bus Pag@@ et .
after a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long recovery period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure an adequate supply of calcium , corresponding to twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ mat@@ orium hip , a Initi@@ ald@@ osis is recommended from 5@@ 0,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney function ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended , as limited clinical experience for this patient population is pre@@ determined .
older patients ( ca . 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elimination in older patients is similar to younger .
children and young people A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended to use in children and young people under 18 years , as data are lacking in the un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
a pre @-@ existing hyp@@ oc@@ al@@ ot emia is to treat the therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta due to sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the fast implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid on the bone structure can develop a temporary , occasionally symp@@ tom@@ atic hyp@@ oc@@ al@@ ot emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after inf@@ usion of the A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.8 ) .
additionally it is advis@@ able to ensure an adequate supply of calcium , according to patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , corresponding to twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer treatment , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ tical ero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be weigh@@ ed in an application of bis@@ phosph@@ ates with accurate prevent@@ ative dental treatment .
for patients who need dental gri@@ ps are no data available whether the break of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of ost@@ e@@ ot@@ rop@@ es in the j@@ aw area .
the clinical assessment of clinical trials should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and be based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen in short after application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of as severe side @-@ effect caused by pre@@ stige was given in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 from 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall pre@@ valence of superi@@ ors between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2,6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2,@@ 1 % ) comparable .

kidney @-@ functioning Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid has been associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which is considered to decrease the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( annual prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney function were in a clinical trial with ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of G@@ abe was observed at 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of Labor Statist@@ ical Kal@@ zi@@ um emerged the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below average patients with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical trial , compared to 21 % of the patients with A@@ cl@@ asta in the mor@@ bus pag@@ e@@ du@@ et studies .
all patients received comple@@ mentary quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis , in the study for preventing clinical frac@@ tures to a hip fac@@ et and in the mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study for preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a Initi@@ ald@@ osis vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in a large clinical trial was reported by local reactions to the inf@@ usion , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis in the orth@@ od@@ on@@ gen occasionally , above all with cancer victims , about ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the orth@@ od@@ or ) reported the bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated .

9 increase in bone density of the ste@@ ering column around 6.@@ 7 % , the total pen@@ ises by 6.@@ 0 % , the leg har@@ ness by 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis patients were treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic comb .
a micro@@ compu@@ ter@@ tom@@ o@@ graphi@@ e- ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to plac@@ ebo a rise of tr@@ ab@@ ek@@ ular bone vol@@ um@@ ens and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ek@@ ular bone architecture .

11 The effectiveness of inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid as compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months .
in the combined results , after 6 months , a similar withdrawal of pain and pain treatment was observed compared to the starting point for au@@ cl@@ asta and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as responsi@@ bly at the end of the six @-@ month primary study ( to the therapy ) , could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with cr@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , the therapeutic approach could be attended by 141 of the A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of those with cr@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients , are maintained during a mid @-@ duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application .

the early distribution phases ( α and ß , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bone and ex@@ cre@@ tion about the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the ab@@ used dose is in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total @-@ body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eous concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion , but had no impact on the surface area under the curve ( pl@@ asma resistant to time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ en@@ z@@ ym@@ aker met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not yet met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by humans , and because they are a f@@ aint or even no direct and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly , met@@ abolic @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -

it arises that a light ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney function up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid requires .
because for severe kidney @-@ functioning ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available for this populations .

accounts is applied for treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent patients ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ al ament ) is not shown . • It can be applied together with another Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) which can be customized with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ actic or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ actic acid or ins@@ ulin can be maintained at the beginning of the accounts ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ actic acid or ins@@ ulin should be reduced .
this means that the body can be improved and improved its own ins@@ ulin , thus allowing the blood sugar levels to better adjust to type @-@ 2 diabetes .
for more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in Tri@@ ple@@ as was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ res@@ in , in addition they received either an account of up to 3.5 years either from accounts or plac@@ ebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
accounts led to a lo@@ wering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes the blood sugar lo@@ wering in the use of d@@ osing capacity of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion trial , the effect of the extra gift of accounts for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ li@@ nit@@ rogen in lo@@ wering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values around 0,94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0,35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and ins@@ ulin in 28@@ 9 patients were examined , patients , the accounts in addition to ins@@ ulin , a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 45 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side @-@ effects in connection with accounts were t@@ ances , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ ana@@ esth@@ esia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to irrit@@ ating ) .

the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on for patients under 18 years of age are not available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. former coron@@ ary heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or o@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced car@@ di@@ aler reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain and o@@ de@@ me , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disorder has been carried out .
in this study there showed an increase in reports of in@@ suffici@@ ency , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased output levels of liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver illness , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should not be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ Spiegel increases up to 3 @-@ times the limit of the standard range , the liver values are to be controlled again as soon as possible .
if a patient developed symptoms that point to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved exercise , fatigue , but@@ ton@@ lessness and / or dar@@ ker res@@ n , the liver ail@@ ments are to check .
the decision whether the patient &apos;s treatment should be continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , should be led to the requirements of the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven to st@@ ir of li@@ abilities and in some cases with a fluid .
as a result of a her@@ it@@ lution , under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a slight reduction of the middle hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ations ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.4 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ atively controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ otherapy in order to 3,@@ 6 @-@ 4.@@ 1 % ) and to a lower scale even in patients under sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ite and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ mo@@ ons by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity consists of patients who Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used as oral dual or tri@@ ple@@ tion therapy with a sul@@ phon@@ ec@@ har@@ n@@ rogen or as a dual @-@ form Com@@ bination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , on a appearance or a deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there are a direct link between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patient reported on disorders of visual shar@@ p@@ ness ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic evaluation should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of undes@@ irable events in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 cargo @-@ value per 100 patient @-@ years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to be treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , for 100 patients with women , which were treated with a compar@@ ative media .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , they were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Re@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative media .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this one is taking care of it ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for exam@@ ining the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic or Phar@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enz@@ ym@@ abo@@ ces , i.e. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium hydrogen and HM@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 2@@ C8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulting in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ on ( a Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 2@@ C8 Ac@@ tor ) resulting in a reduction of AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on used in pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to the uter@@ ine and thereby dimin@@ ished the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal system .

these lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the inde@@ xes of the lens , as it also observed in other hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substance .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one advoc@@ ated over the triple @-@ fold of the upper limit of norm@@ ali@@ ases often to such as plac@@ ebo but less common than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ li@@ nit@@ rogen .
in an out@@ come study in patients with previously advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , the incidence of severe her@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1,6 % higher than among plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
since the launch of market in@@ suffici@@ ency , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reports , more common , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
it became a summar@@ ised analysis of reports undes@@ irable events in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated in groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated in contrac@@ ted groups .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , fr@@ aming at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) who were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative media .
in taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , after 180 m@@ g. daily over seven days there were no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Peri@@ ox@@ idi@@ omas Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Ac@@ tiv@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and sk@@ elet@@ on muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ ity production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral Glu@@ cos@@ ities in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the retro@@ fit of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ ( 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
at the time after two years after starting treatment a blood pressure control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ ulated study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were random@@ ised despite three @-@ month optim@@ is@@ sive phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , compared to patients who remains only ins@@ ulin , compared with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed themselves a statist@@ ically significant reduction in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ onal compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks study conducted on type @-@ 2 di@@ ab@@ etics .
in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the total pl@@ asma tri@@ gly@@ co@@ eride and the free fatty acids and a rise of the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as lower , however clin@@ ically not statist@@ ically increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total pl@@ as@@ matri@@ gly@@ co@@ eride and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to plac@@ ebo under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was no statist@@ ically significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while under met@@ form@@ in and extrem@@ cl@@ azi@@ d decreased values were observed .
in a study about 20 weeks reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial raised tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this is both an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular output study , 5@@ 238 patients were random@@ ised with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disorder in groups , which were given over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ bi@@ ased , whereby the leading con@@ centric Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is normally reached in pl@@ asma 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution from M @-@ IV to the effectiveness in about triple the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ actions studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic or Phar@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral use of radi@@ o@@ active mar@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the subjects ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the middle pl@@ asma @-@ elimination period of un@@ changed pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and which is the entire active met@@ abolic rate at 16 - 23 hours .
the pl@@ asma @-@ zentr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy Pro@@ b@@ anden , whereby the fr@@ ying of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance however resem@@ ble .

the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had a transplan@@ t as it was not tested for these groups .
in the first study , attended by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different A@@ den@@ uri@@ c d@@ oses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared to those of a plac@@ ebo ( head@@ lamp ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medication for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of A@@ den@@ uri@@ c ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol each year .
in both studies al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose har@@ p levels in the blood was placed at the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study we had 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients who took the A@@ den@@ uri@@ c in a dose of once daily 80 mg and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of those who once daily 120 mg took a res@@ in @-@ level measurement in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) in the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ uri@@ c ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal living standards .
in particular , in patients with heart care , there is also an increased risk of certain side effects which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) launched to conclude that A@@ den@@ uri@@ c was more effective in lo@@ wering the Har@@ ns@@ st@@ resp@@ i@@ eg@@ els in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and the blood vessels .

as a result of transplan@@ ts , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease in patients with ana@@ emia cardi@@ ac disease or de@@ compens@@ ate in@@ suffici@@ ency is not recommended to treatment with feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ res@@ cent drugs , it can come to an acute ho@@ ich@@ fall during the treatment process , because by lo@@ wering the ser@@ um@@ har@@ oc@@ y@@ line at first Har@@ ns@@ st@@ abl@@ ers can be mobili@@ zed in the tissues .

primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney @-@ dys@@ functions The AP@@ EX study resulted in the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney @-@ work constra@@ int ( .@@ h ) .
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C became the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with the percentage down@@ fall of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ns@@ con@@ centric passages concerning pro@@ b@@ anden , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used for the treatment of ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , where the bones are br@@ ittle and used ) with women after men@@ op@@ ause , in which a risk for a low vitamin D mirror exists .
the patient must take tablets with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or import other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and vital substances ) .
to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest to take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company laid out data that origin@@ ate from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 males and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in relation to increasing vitamin D spi@@ der .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients treated a lower vitamin D mirror with patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at only ( 32 % ) .
the company also laid out information that in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE contained Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose is exactly the dose which is needed for the prevention of a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , de@@ sti@@ pul@@ ations , di@@ arr@@ al ( arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , de@@ sti@@ pul@@ ations , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , Gesch@@ ul@@ ence ( arr@@ ho@@ ome@@ i , dy@@ nasty ) , infl@@ ating ab@@ dom@@ en ( brus@@ hing stomach ) as well as su@@ ck pul@@ ling .
in patients with high hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( all@@ ergy ) against ag@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 , or any other components , AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should not be applied .
it must not be applied in diseases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium mirror ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage , or import of medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and vital @-@ supplements ) for the day to take .
the following references are to be followed just to reduce the risk to mal@@ ign@@ ite irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should be sho@@ cked according to the performance of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should do go on the tablet or tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

it is very important that all d@@ osing instructions will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .

due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , this may lead to transplan@@ t loss or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .

in a result of switching to an alternative formulation , needs to be carried out a therapeutic medication and corresponding dosage adjustment to ensure that the system@@ ic ex@@ position of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m remains intact .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of loss and compatibility in individual case and on blood levels . see below &quot; recommendations

if the condition of the patient in the first post@@ operative phase is not allowed to capture medicinal products , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentr@@ ates on the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) .
the duration of the application due to the transplan@@ t of the transplan@@ t , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression must be sustained ; consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t therapy should commen@@ ce with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift .
further dosage adjustment can be necessary later , as the Pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift .
dosage recommendations - switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be turned into a transplan@@ ment of twice daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , to take place on the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t after switching from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once daily needs to begin with the kidney and liver transplan@@ tation for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are placed on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , a or@@ ale initiation dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day daily to take place in the morning .
other transplan@@ t @-@ receiver , there was no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pan@@ cre@@ atic and dar@@ ed patients infected in a or@@ alen Initi@@ ald@@ osis from 0,2 mg / kg / day and in intest@@ inal transplan@@ t@@ osis from 0,3 mg / kg / day for application .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with limited Leb@@ er@@ function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood @-@ tal@@ low in the cont@@ ac@@ ed area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a flo@@ wering of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Da die kidney function does not affect the pharmaceutical function of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ical potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular identification of ser@@ um@@ cular stations , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ clear@@ ance and a monitoring of ur@@ inary bladder ) .
switch from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f At the shift from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the Tal@@ king in the full blo@@ t The dose should be based primarily at the clinical assessment of loss and compatibility in the individual case from full @-@ blu@@ red @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m Tal@@ king during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m should also change after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , amendments of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at simultaneous use of substances , which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m thorou@@ gh@@ ing circulation ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose can take several days until the ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials are expected to conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the reservoir in the blood 20 ng / ml do not exceed .
in clinical practice the talents of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus usually lie in full blo@@ om in the first time following liver transplan@@ ts , usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and ne@@ sting - and heart transplan@@ ts patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
while the subsequent treatment of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ s have usually been blood @-@ centralized in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including Tran@@ splan@@ ch@@ rep@@ ent@@ ations or other side effects , which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m sub@@ or trans@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; or@@ tions of the formulation or the regime should only be done under the narrow @-@ machine control of one in the transplan@@ t experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t surgery , which has proven to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ si@@ va as a therap@@ ist , there are no clinical data available for the saved formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation for adult heart suffer@@ ers and transplan@@ ts , there are no clinical data available for the saved formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
because of possible interactions formed to de@@ composition the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ mirror in the blood and a ton@@ ing of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant supplements ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant supplements ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood offers , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m blood levels can be subject to significant variations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f one as Kar@@ di@@ omy@@ e@@ opath@@ y , exter@@ min@@ ated or sept@@ um hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing cardi@@ ac disease , a treatment with cor@@ tical problems , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver functioning , infections , hydr@@ ation , and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ si@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV @-@ light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to the appropriate clothing or using a radi@@ ator factor .
when patients suffering the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , symptoms for PR@@ ES such as head@@ aches , changes in consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual dys@@ functions should show a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies which are known as a inhibit@@ or or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m and thus reduce the blood @-@ values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m or lower .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood mirror with simultaneous gift of substances , which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m dose to maintain equal concentr@@ ations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction has been made with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ ic medication such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ ector ( z .

since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m allow the clearing up of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thereby increase the hormone position , making decisions taken especially cau@@ ti@@ ous measures especially cau@@ ti@@ ous .
the results of veter@@ in@@ arians have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can reduce the clearing of Pen@@ to@@ bar@@ bit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of investigations on transplan@@ t patients don &apos;t provide any indication that among Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ si@@ va , a higher risk for unwanted events concerning the course and outcome of pregnancy .

due to its high molecular weight , its low water @-@ sol@@ uble and high bonds of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and pl@@ asma rot@@ eine can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ fied .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions must be wo@@ unded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the administration @-@ speed should be directed after the protection of the patient , whereby maximum inj@@ ections of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .

based on the data from first @-@ marketing data , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits of risk prevention , but considering that the safety profile should be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is necessary on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE which is required for a fil@@ ing from PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the author@@ ization of authorisation has to request another renewal of authorisation .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited signed the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ints ( CH@@ MP ) officially recogni@@ zes that the company with@@ draws his application for approval for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , are the breasts , the brain , the bones or the grain parts ( tissues that connects other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) of it .
this is a type of virus that has gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has changed so that there is no copies of itself and thus do not trigger any infections in humans .
for ex@@ ex@@ in would have turned directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the un@@ broken inside the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , is usually contributing to the restoration of corrupt DNA and killing the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in which the p@@ 53 gene is broken , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share .
the company laid data from a study with a patient before the Li @-@ Frau@@ ch@@ i @-@ cancer in the field of sub@@ construction , into the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP did the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the initial documents submitted papers , the CH@@ MP is created on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors takes advantage for the patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not proven sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ance can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notice the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients has currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed substance release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so mer@@ ged that one of the effective components left immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is applied to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhin@@ itis ( hy@@ po@@ graphy ) , by an all@@ ergy to pol@@ len ( inflammation of the n@@ as@@ al paths ) in patients with as@@ n@@ as@@ u@@ der@@ ous sw@@ elling ( hidden nose ) .
in adults and young people aged 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ ze twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ end@@ omet@@ ri@@ um ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be dimin@@ ished by the sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main contribut@@ or were the changes of the sever@@ ity of h@@ ay treatment symptoms which were reported by patients before starting treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all h@@ ak@@ su@@ ction symptoms , besides the sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients reported the aer@@ on@@ ze , over a decrease in symptoms of 46.@@ 0 % , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in patients who captured p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ end@@ omet@@ ri@@ um was reported , patients showed below Aer@@ ina@@ ze a alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms around 37,@@ 4 % compared to the patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( heart illness ) , harmon@@ icity , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , aden@@ itis , head@@ ache , fatigue , ins@@ om@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ ness ) , sleeping disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ ina@@ ze is allowed in patients who may not be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , to rep@@ ent agents or lor@@ at@@ ine ( another medicine to treat allergi@@ es ) are not to be applied .
aer@@ y@@ ze may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a Eng@@ vin@@ kel@@ glau@@ coma ( elevated eye pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or already had a hem@@ orrho@@ ea stroke ( caused by brain blood vessels ) or have a risk for a hem@@ orrho@@ ea stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission rus@@ hed to the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ ina@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is basically to swal@@ low ( i.e. without it to break , break or to ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze should be applied due to mis@@ conception and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) are not used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not be continued according to the symptoms .
it is recommended that limit the time of application to 10 days because at long @-@ term , the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take off with time .
after the decline of the sw@@ elling of the v@@ eil in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued when needed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
da aer@@ ina@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine includes , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is attributed to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combination with other vas@@ o @-@ morph@@ ines like bro@@ mo@@ crip@@ it@@ in , per@@ go@@ id , Di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ gas , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other Dek@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and the effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for that patient care and the data are not enough to address relevant recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ y@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to express appropriate recommendations on dosage .
patients need to be informed about the treatment in the incidence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac or coron@@ ary arr@@ hyth@@ mia , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or et@@ w@@ ai@@ gen other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of the head@@ aches ) .
in the treatment of subsequent patients , patients are advised to be treated : • patients suffering from cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ ic@@ attack in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder emp@@ athy or bronze in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours before conducting mat@@ ological testing , since Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka will otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce in their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol have also been administ@@ ered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the pl@@ asma @-@ san@@ itation has been observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , there were no significant differences between the patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo irrespective of whether it has been taken by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol .
the enzy@@ me responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not identified yet , so that interactions with other medicines could not be excluded completely .

A@@ eri@@ us was conducted in total eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of m@@ add@@ les , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
there were further studies submitted to verify that the body requires the sy@@ rup , the solution to the entry and the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets in the same manner as the tablets and the use with children un@@ question@@ able .
amongst allergic rhin@@ itis , if the results of all studies were brought together , two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average withdrawal of the symptom ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .

the experience gained from clinical trials for the effectiveness in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for young people aged 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mit@@ ig@@ ating allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be completed according to the previous disease process and can be ended after the end of the symptoms and can be res@@ umed in their re@@ occur .
the persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms between 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during all@@ ergy time treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been established in the framework of clinical trial with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administ@@ ered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , at equal intake of as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol was not reinforced ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be explained about it , that in very rare cases it can come to stu@@ per , which can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment or the ability to use machines .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , as in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most commonly reported side effects that was more common than those reported on plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth@@ wash ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
at a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 patients aged 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect of head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and with 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ multi @-@ dose study , which were administ@@ ered up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ inflammat@@ ory Zy@@ tok@@ ens as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human m@@ ast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hesive P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ in at End@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ specialist , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine resulted in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days each day , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dosage ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval indicated .
at one single dos@@ is@@ - study involving adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg has no influence on standard measuring ranges of flu@@ de@@ composition , including strengthening subjective end@@ ness or the tasks linked to the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ al secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , it@@ tery and red@@ ness of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z at the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classi@@ fy in sa@@ is@@ onal and Per@@ enni@@ al , may be allergic rhin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mit@@ ig@@ ating allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent Rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as on the basis of the total co@@ res of the frag@@ ments for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Konjun@@ ktur vit@@ is , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively empha@@ sized the equ@@ alization of allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investig@@ ating other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ physi@@ ology in the differ@@ ing forms is similar and chronic patients can be rec@@ spec@@ tively en@@ spec@@ tively .
since the hist@@ amine release is an urs@@ or factor in all of the ur@@ inary disorders , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine is also attributed to improving symptoms in other forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lo@@ wering of size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dosage intervals .

an improvement of the tor@@ ment by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and awareness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess this variable .
in a Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients &apos; demo@@ s are comparable to the general seasonal rhin@@ itis -@@ Pop@@ ulation , was achieved by 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no locking points for a clin@@ ically relevant cal@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , this enzy@@ me is still not identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , however , it was not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and older people to protect influ@@ enza , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 from the influ@@ enza @-@ A @-@ virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a future pan@@ dem@@ ic virus that could cause a future pan@@ dem@@ ic .
a influ@@ enza breaks out when a new trunk of the flu takes up , which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the human vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; body foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms the anti@@ body against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way the immune system is later able to form in contact with a gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus of this tribe faster anti@@ body .
subsequently , the membrane envel@@ oping the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body alien ) , and used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this caused the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the security of the vaccine to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre@@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vaccines .

it is used in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines for treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency Virus Typ 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are infected with the acquired immun@@ o Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to the admission , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be en@@ acted when the doctor has checked , which anti@@ vir@@ al medicine has previously taken previously , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood of viruses will address the virus on the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of aging is based on the body weight .
aging is reduced in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al drugs the HIV amounts in blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS not to heal , however , it may delay the immune system , and thus also the development of with AIDS connected infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al drugs , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , who had previously been treated with a release .
this with low do@@ si@@ oni@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had previously taken the release of the release with other prot@@ ectors .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ evidence concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in Vir@@ us@@ last after the treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ector , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had less than 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in children decreased A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the vir@@ al last , although with the children , who were previously treated with prot@@ ector , only very few of the treatment mentioned .
in the study involving adults , which had been treated earlier with prot@@ ector , lo@@ wer@@ ed with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug A@@ gener@@ ase inhibit@@ ing to 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ector :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prototyp@@ ing brake resistant , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger decline of Vir@@ al last to four weeks than with the patients who took their previous prot@@ ector release :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( inf@@ il@@ ess ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and F@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against am@@ us@@ or or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be applied in patients , the cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplements to treat depression ) or medicines that are just as well as A@@ gen@@ ase and are to be harmful in high concentr@@ ations in the blood health .
as with other drugs against HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ase inhibit@@ ors the risk of an pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , an ost@@ e@@ at@@ rous tissue ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ active synchron@@ ous drug ( symptoms of an infection caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) launched to conclude that the benefits of aging in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines used to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years towards the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ o@@ etic ampli@@ fier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee proved that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no prot@@ ector , not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the approval of scientific reasons for scientific reasons was proposed only . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the use of amp@@ pren@@ eur@@ r should be carried out under consideration of the individual vir@@ al Resi@@ st@@ ence and Pre@@ treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the one is less than 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ change@@ able ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ us@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 . when A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ st@@ erung ) , higher d@@ oses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ pren@@ eur@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the Pharmac@@ op@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ectors were not tested in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the mis@@ use of data to be thought@@ fulness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ological data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions on 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be done in patients with mild or moderate living @-@ functioning with caution , in patients with severe living @-@ functioning it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .

patients should be advised that aging or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a cure from HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
for usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be used along with low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C , and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have an increased risk for heavy liver surfaces with potentially fatal disease course .
for the event of simultaneous anti @-@ vir@@ al treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please consult the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing hep@@ atitis liver function including a chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis show an increased frequency of liver functioning under a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other gl@@ uc@@ o@@ eu@@ tics that is not recommended above CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 per , unless that the possible benefit of a treatment reduces the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ i@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including mor@@ bus Cus@@ ps and supplements of the adren@@ al function .

at HIV infected patients with severe immune def@@ ect may develop an inflammat@@ ory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ u@@ alties , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , were reported cases of ost@@ e@@ at@@ rous in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with lower therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase should not simultaneously possess medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with pharmac@@ euticals whose active ingredients are predomin@@ antly di@@ mm@@ ed over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for the increased pl@@ asma @-@ seals with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logic understanding and lead to a resistance development .
in trying to compens@@ ate the low @-@ low pl@@ asma through a dosage adjustment of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed .

if a patient has already installed cur@@ rants , the pay@@ roll is checked and when it is possible to verify the Vir@@ uses and pic@@ ks the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the pharmac@@ euticals is not required when Nel@@ um@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max by 30 % lower , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ us@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .

52 % lower , when Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ opin@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ makers in pl@@ asma ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ opin@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ us@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered twice daily .
a met@@ ering recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is widely recommended but a widespread monitoring is not known as the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ological study conducted on the application of A@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , is advised due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase lie at least an hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
that is why the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins ext@@ enders would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ ector , and existing limited data let suspected that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine may possibly lowers the Ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din because of the decreased and possibly sub@@ therapeutic pl@@ asma could be less effective .
when these drugs are applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logic monitoring should be made , as an exact forecast of the effect of combination of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to detect on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of amp@@ makers and ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to a rise in pl@@ asma @-@ center ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at 193 % and thus a rise in connected with meg@@ fab@@ ut@@ in connected side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is to be administ@@ ered at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
Pharmac@@ eutical studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but the pl@@ asma @-@ stones of both medicinal products could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase in C@@ max by k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in pl@@ asma compared to the value , which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , potentially lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions that are linked to these drugs , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ector , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da is not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can come to Res@@ ort@@ ment disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va , known as enz@@ ym@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the pl@@ asma systems of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .

the simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ion with aging can increase their pl@@ asma @-@ centralized and increase using P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection @-@ related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days of trial period , while the End@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ connectivity interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these Gl@@ uc@@ o@@ eu@@ tics , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment reduces the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ i@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ G reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is heavily dependent of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced the cre@@ ase of pl@@ asma at simultaneous administration of aging .
da Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel@@ ung of this h@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opath@@ y , including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ se , the combined use of these drugs with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
there will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the pl@@ asma @-@ centr@@ ate has increased from Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m to be raised by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase is not used together with or@@ ally un@@ bi@@ ased Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while in the same application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ c@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advis@@ able .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ c@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors to a possible increase in the pl@@ asma stream from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered together with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ext symptoms , especially if there are also low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the per se low cas@@ u@@ ousness of historical compar@@ isons can currently no recommendation be given , such as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose to adapt when Am@@ us@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
for simultaneous display of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standards for rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of ton@@ ing or rein@@ forcement of the physi@@ ological effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ monal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predic@@ table , hence also alternative methods of contrac@@ eption .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side @-@ effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example Desi@@ re@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ ypto@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m für Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines Resi@@ st@@ enz as the presence of the mut@@ ations of L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a stolen phenomen@@ al resistance with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a decreased probability of a vi@@ ro@@ etic contact person ( Resi@@ st@@ enz ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is advised to always move the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems to analyse the results of resistance tests .
at phenomen@@ al Resi@@ st@@ enz@@ ental inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used in conjunction with the genetic data regarding the de@@ valu@@ ation of the activity of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ector @-@ resistant insulation @-@ resistant insulation .
companies to distribute the diagnostic tests , have been clin@@ ically @-@ phenomen@@ al Cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r associate patterns creates a certain cross@@ resist@@ ence against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ um@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for the cross @-@ resist@@ ence between domestic and other prot@@ ectors for all 4 fossil avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously untreated patients in which an anti@@ st@@ ew@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ thi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ us@@ r reserves its activity against several other prot@@ ector @-@ resistant insulation ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a vers@@ al therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which may affect the following treatment .
the test@@ ament of the effectiveness of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cl@@ ashes ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predomin@@ antly with reduced Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred ( s = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in view to the period ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ al last ( E@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Plas@@ ma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ lower vibration of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ authorized A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and capsules in d@@ osing of 15 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ ent rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of people with PI previously untreated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of which received with A@@ gener@@ ase N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients included in the study included a pl@@ asma @-@ HIV virus &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output level .
19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered during the treatment optim@@ isation with PI previously expected children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ brid@@ oo@@ st@@ ilt &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( to@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule , and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max by 30 % reduced when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , along with Am@@ us@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of amp@@ pren@@ an@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % reduction in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of pay@@ ers 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration at the ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake is influenced by the extent and rate of the res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution capacity is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves to a large distribution capacity as well as an un@@ avoid@@ able penetration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in pl@@ asma , with the amount of un@@ bi@@ ased am@@ us@@ s which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bi@@ ased am@@ us@@ r remains constant , fluctu@@ ating the percentage of free active components throughout the met@@ abolic sequence in the ste@@ ady State in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min .
therefore , pharmac@@ euticals , which indu@@ ce CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ voke or in@@ appro@@ ve or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg every three times , leads to a similar daily routine exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
entrepren@@ eu@@ r is out of solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and aging capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able with a milli@@ grams .
also the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of a kidney @-@ functioning on the elimination of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ us@@ av@@ r pl@@ asma pi@@ eg@@ eln comparable to those who at healthy pro@@ b@@ anden after a dose of 1200 mg amp@@ h@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the cann@@ on of mice and rats has occurred in male animals hep@@ at@@ ne hep@@ at@@ cell@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome with d@@ oses , that of the 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg amp@@ h@@ r , languages mentioned .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ onic cell@@ ular o@@ den@@ ome and cardi@@ ology has not yet been un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on the human , both of clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , there are little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ test tests , the bacterial @-@ test tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chro@@ mos@@ omen@@ ab@@ err@@ ation@@ st@@ est in human periph@@ eral l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is neither mut@@ lar nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically .
these live tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by measuring of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ates .
until now , in clinical studies , there was not yet been a significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during administration of aging , nor by the end of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated as early as 4 days , showed up a high mort@@ ality in the controls as well as with affiliates .
with a system@@ ic pl@@ asma composition , which was significant among ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , have been observed a number of minor changes including th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor sk@@ elet@@ on changes that point to a del@@ ayed development .
24 . when A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ st@@ erung ) , higher d@@ oses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ pren@@ eur@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amp@@ h@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is to be done in patients with f@@ aint or mild living @-@ functioning with caution , in patients with severe living @-@ functioning it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For several medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be pos@@ ited in duration 27 if a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the lo@@ ops are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk to a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logic understanding and lead to a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max by 30 % lower , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ us@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ makers in pl@@ asma ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ opin@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ us@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered twice daily .

the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins ext@@ enders would be low .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is applied to the enzy@@ me therapy in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ d@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase lack ) used to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve ) .
this means that certain substances ( Gly@@ kos@@ amin@@ o@@ gly@@ kan@@ e , G@@ ags ) are not being built and thus in most organs in the body and these harmful .
following not neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements tend to dimin@@ ish lungs , cardi@@ ac volume , heart and au@@ gen@@ ial disorders .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational devices , and patients may require such medicines to replace an allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by studying the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years of aging Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine of about 60 % , and half of the aff@@ o@@ ed children dism@@ issed the end of the study a normal large liver .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , skin pain , rash , at@@ rop@@ athy ( yellow pain ) , pain pain , pain in the limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fe@@ ver and reactions to the inf@@ usion site .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased loss of oxygen ( a measuring size of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fe@@ ver and sho@@ ok .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be highly vulnerable ( allergic ) to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , not to be applied .
the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) is every year all new information that may be announced , check and submit this summary , if necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is given to patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission divided the European Commission Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for long @-@ time enzy@@ me in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ d@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase lack ) is indi@@ ces to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be added if the patient gets this , every 15 minutes in single steps on a maxim@@ ald@@ osis of 43 E / kg / h was added .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 has not been established , and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been established , and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients may develop inf@@ usion related reactions that are defined as any associated side @-@ effect , which occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion ( see Section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be widespread in machine , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out immediately at a reasonable level of clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , that virtually all patients can form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase usually within 3 months from treatment course .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience in relation to the renewal of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , has to be careful due to the theoretically increased risk @-@ reaction after inter@@ ruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ ka ) , to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence of infectious reactions .
in the case of a light or medi@@ al inf@@ usion reaction , the treatment should be weigh@@ ed with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ ap@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate , where the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be stopped until the symptoms are reported to the symptoms associated with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ ap@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
inf@@ usion can result in inf@@ usion of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate , where the reaction has occurred , again .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ ap@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate , which occurred in reaction .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of an interference with the intra@@ operative inclusion of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is used .
Tier@@ experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ ale development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
as no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated compared to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase above the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , is recommended while treating with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the side @-@ effects in clinical trials were sorted mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in the phase @-@ 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study of 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug operations related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3@@ - study and its extension for a total of 45 patients aged five years , or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are usually listed in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper air@@ ways and lungs in the pre@@ history , there were heavy reactions to , including bronze , respir@@ ation and facial imp@@ eding ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ solic@@ ited drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 @-@ study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly he@@ gemon@@ y form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week , 200 e / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every two weeks .
most patients have occurred within 3 months after starting treatment to a ser@@ van version , whereby it occurred among patients at the age of 5 with a he@@ avier delay . ( on average after 26 days of 45 days compared to 45 days in age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase @-@ 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) were found at 13 / 45 patients no by radi@@ o@@ immun@@ o cip@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say demonstr@@ able antibodies , including 3 patients with which it had never been to ser@@ van .
patients with fail@@ ing to lower antibodies refer@@ enced to a robust decline of the G@@ AG Spi@@ eg@@ els in the Har@@ n , while patients with high antibodies would be able to establish a variable decrease of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase @-@ 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal up to low NEU@@ TRA@@ LI@@ Z@@ LI@@ TE inhibit@@ or effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ oni@@ das@@ - activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to imp@@ air clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies appeared not to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drugs actions , even if the appearance of undes@@ irable pharmaceutical agents typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one for the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ ys@@ is of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of another accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzy@@ me .
in intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and of cells into the l@@ ymph@@ omas , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ors recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ ulated phase @-@ 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients have been recru@@ ited for the study carried out the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the mean phen@@ otyp@@ e and a patient dism@@ issed the serious phen@@ otyp@@ e .
patients have been en@@ rolled , if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ ator volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary outcomes for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute en@@ closures in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ e- test test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label add@@ ying study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the plac@@ ebo group an improvement of the lung function and the ability to present in the following table .
in an open expansion study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as out of the following table emerg@@ es .
the decrease of the predic@@ tive percentage FE@@ V is not significant about this period clin@@ ically and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
by the 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ u@@ pol before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) by the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established , which remained constant down to the study program .
regarding het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous path@@ ology between patients suffering from using a combined end point ( an expected percentage point ) across the 6 @-@ minute walk , movement of the shoulder @-@ en@@ gen@@ ess A@@ HI and ch@@ ili@@ es ( 58 % ) , has generally been an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration at 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it has been conducted a year @-@ old open phase @-@ 2 study , which primarily examined the safety and pharmac@@ etics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy degrad@@ ation form and 4 with the medium run form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle course shape ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle course shape , whereas the elderly patients could be limited only or no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study investigations into pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schem@@ ata on the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week , 200 e / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every two weeks .
the met@@ ering scheme with 200 e / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous can represent every two weeks in patients who represent difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two met@@ abolic schem@@ ata is equivalent .

the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed set the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of the drug and a longer function of cancer cells .
Alim@@ ta was investigated for treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ing Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , Alim@@ ta was studied in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received any chemotherapy against their condition .
in the treatment of non @-@ binding lung cancer the effects of Alim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had been dealt with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different medicine against cancer ) .
Alim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further drug against cancer ) and both in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received any chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with Alim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in , survived average for 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survi@@ ving life with Alim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , patients , where cancer does not attack the turn@@ al cells , for the administration of Alim@@ ta for longer survival times than with the reference media .
September 2004 , the European Commission divided the company El@@ i Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Alim@@ ta to the entire European Union .
every penetration bottle must be en@@ rolled with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.9 % of so@@ dium hydro@@ chlori@@ de inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis will be taken from the sm@@ elling bottle and with 0.9 % of so@@ dium hydro@@ chlori@@ de inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in currently on first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic Bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except in excess body @-@ epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .

the recommended dose of cis@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ professional bron@@ chi@@ al cancer , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administ@@ ered as a intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the reduction of the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin actions must be given a day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed goods , as well as on the day after the treatment is a cor@@ tical ero@@ id .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid and intake should be continued during the entire treatment of therapy and for further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) during the week before the first pit re@@ xed dose as well as after any third session cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , in front of each gift , a complete blood @-@ picture was created - the , including a differenti@@ ation of the lumin@@ aire and a Th@@ rom@@ atic wi@@ res .
the al@@ kal@@ ische phosph@@ or@@ ase ( AP ) , Asp@@ art@@ at @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anin @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a Dos@@ age must take place under Ber@@ ück@@ ner &apos;s blood pressure or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predic@@ tive therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood circulation .
if patients are non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity measurements 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient is the value before treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA has to be broken when in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ cus @-@ reduction , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues in the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over the age of 65 there is an increased by @-@ risk risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended to use in children under the age of 18 due to sufficient data to the un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing @-@ up to 45 ml / min has no dosage adjustment necessary to go beyond the dosage recommended for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance at 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a living @-@ function constra@@ int &gt; The 1,5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ ary bound@@ ary and / or trans@@ amination value of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper border @-@ value ( with evidence of liver metastatic ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper border @-@ value ( in the presence of liver metastatic ) , not specifically examined in the studies .
patients need to be super@@ vised with regard to the frac@@ ture and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , not to be administ@@ ered by patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ rom@@ phil@@ ately has a value of ∅ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ atic and the Th@@ rom@@ atic and the Th@@ rom@@ atic @-@ figure has again reached a value of the Amino 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ rom@@ atic number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a reduced tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ ebr@@ ile Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was observed if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients need to be instruc@@ ted to be instruc@@ ted with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ y- lak@@ tic measure to reduction tox@@ icity . ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid equal intake of anti @-@ oxid@@ ants and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ va ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ ce@@ - tens of days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy is provided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long semi @-@ value period for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , we had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liqui@@ ds , collection in the trans@@ cell@@ ular room a Dra@@ in@@ age of the sei@@ zing before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment shall be weigh@@ ed .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ os , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this drug is usually administ@@ ered combined with a other cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated vital substances ( except yellow fe@@ ver , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible shortage of damage caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - can be advised to obtain advice on the sperm activation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high d@@ oses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ minerals ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high Dos@@ age ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased re@@ ap@@ ing of side effects .
therefore , caution is advis@@ able if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high d@@ oses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ ce@@ - tens of days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data in connection with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ value like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ i@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the bar@@ gain status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Standards Rati@@ o ) if the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
no data is expected to use P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for pregnant women , but as at an@@ de@@ - the tre@@ ach@@ ts are expected at a application in pregnancy severe birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if absolutely exhau@@ sting and after careful det@@ ach@@ ment of the utility for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive @-@ protection provided by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out prior to the treatment of the treatment of the treatment .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects on the stu@@ ff@@ ed cleans@@ ing cannot be ruled out .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the Pop@@ ulation of all patients who were given in the treatment arm the aud@@ ition@@ ers ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statist@@ ically significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ing Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown in the case of Lun@@ - gen@@ kre@@ bs@@ symp@@ tom@@ sk@@ ala in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ plat@@ in @-@ Arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ co T@@ in @-@ Arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment @-@ arms takes themselves by an improvement of the lung @-@ parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ plat@@ in arm and a connec@@ t@@ edness of the lung function in the course of time in Kont@@ rol@@ lar@@ m .
a multi@@ centralized , random@@ ized , open phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy treatment ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Pop@@ ulation n = 2@@ 83 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el to actually treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .

in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and break are revealed 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi , in 24 hours after chemotherapy does not break ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
for comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values are 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission part@@ ed the European Commission of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ ces : for prevention of ev@@ acu@@ ity nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with severe em@@ eto@@ itive chemotherapy according to cancer treatment and the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with moderate in@@ eto@@ oth @-@ chemotherapy according to a cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi on the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is in@@ duced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding any Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on tank , patients should be monitored using an am@@ nest@@ y ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ marine I@@ le@@ us after the inj@@ ecting machine .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able at the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t@@ - interval is extended or bow@@ ed to such an extension .
besides in connection with another chemotherapy agents , alo@@ xi is supposed to be used neither to prevent chemotherapy nor to treat nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical trials inhibit@@ ing Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron the in@@ tox@@ ic@@ iled activity of the five studied chemical otherap@@ eu@@ tics not ( cis@@ plat@@ in , cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide , Cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical trial , there were no significant pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic interaction between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage and a ste@@ ady @-@ static vas@@ cular met@@ o@@ cl@@ op@@ r@@ ami@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one on a population based pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic analysis was shown that the simultaneous running of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ dic@@ ine ( D@@ ex@@ ame@@ ar@@ on , Flu@@ oxet@@ ine , semi @-@ oxet@@ ine , k@@ oxet@@ ine , k@@ oxet@@ ine , k@@ oxet@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) has not had a significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences of the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies , therefore , should not be applied , therefore , should be considered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron for pregnant , unless it is necessary from the treated doctor than necessary .
in clinical trials , the most common in a dose of 250 mc@@ g to ob@@ serving side @-@ side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity and reactions of administration ( brow@@ ning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage showed themselves similar cases of unwanted events such as in the other d@@ osing @-@ groups ; there were no dose of a dose of action .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies conducted because of the great distribution vol@@ um@@ ens is a di@@ aly@@ sis however pres@@ um@@ ably no effective therapy in Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised dou@@ ble@@ d@@ studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , which received a moderate in@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ day 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.2 hours ) , which was given in day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ous .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind , total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with oral 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1,@@ 500 mg / m2 Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ men@@ ce , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , which were given 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron that were given on day 1 of the intra@@ ven@@ ous .
results of the studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ oth @-@ chemotherapy and the study with severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy is summar@@ ised in the following tables ( sheets ) .
in clinical trials for indications of chemotherapy in@@ duced exercise and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the inv@@ ented failure , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the channels involved at the v@@ entri@@ cular DE@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation involved and the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy Pro@@ b@@ anden study was the assessment of the EC@@ G &apos;s effects of i.@@ V. ad@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single d@@ oses of 0,25 , 0,75 and 2,25 mg .
summary After intra@@ ven@@ ous G@@ abe follows the initial decrease of the pl@@ asma @-@ centr@@ alised , a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ous half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum pl@@ asma @-@ zentr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the whole tin @-@ range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg by healthy and cancer victims dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intra@@ ven@@ ous G@@ abe by Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 d@@ oses , consisting of 11 high @-@ temperature oxid@@ ants were measured between day 1 and day 5 % increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ ser@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ological sim@@ ulations from pharmac@@ euticals , that resulted in even daily intra@@ ven@@ ous G@@ abe in 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which after non @-@ recur@@ ring intra@@ ven@@ ous administration , however , the C@@ max after the addition of 0,75 mg was higher .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on Met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a minor extent that I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt projection at healthy , the total @-@ clear@@ ance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe living @-@ functioning the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ism and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is therefore non @-@ justified .
in pre@@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered adequate over the maximum human@@ ic exposure , which suggests a low relevance for the clinical use .
10 For pre@@ clinical trials , references that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentr@@ ations , which can be involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular DE@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and can pro@@ long the shareholders of action .
high d@@ oses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose said in about the 30@@ fold of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of living , end@@ ocr@@ ine , pan@@ cre@@ atic , pan@@ cre@@ atic sp@@ inal cord ) and skin @-@ um@@ ors with rats , but not with mice .
underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high d@@ oses and since alo@@ xi is intended for humans to be unique use , the relevance of these results are evaluated for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ints ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative credit , where the approval of approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C is recommended by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ecting solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same practice , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference intake ) . &quot;
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ standing ) hep@@ atitis C ( one through vir@@ al infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation the liver tissue indicates that the values of the liver @-@ enz@@ ym@@ ms Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been initiated that this applies to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon put data before the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and pur@@ ity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and effectiveness at Hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference practices in 455 patients .
the study was measured , as many patients after 12 of total 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the drug mentioned ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document , what were the greatest concerns raised by CH@@ MP at the recommendation to fail the approval for the transport ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , concerns were expressed concerns that the data on the stability of the drug and the market must not be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C who spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with al@@ eon , the disease vacc@@ inated with more patients than at the reference point ; moreover , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test carried out in the study by exam@@ ining the question , to what extent the drug is an immune response ( that is , the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust education ) and small in@@ infected Laz@@ arus ( R@@ iss@@ - or counter @-@ unden ) , de@@ ed and se@@ wn wo@@ unds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to treat infections , which were det@@ ectable or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go does not affect this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine , but in patients under the age of 18 , patients may not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should once again examine the patient and consider altern@@ ate treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial re@@ bo@@ oms ( the parts of the bacterial infections in which proteins are produced ) and thus in@@ hibit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator of the effectiveness was fil@@ med in all five studies of the patients whose infection was completed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ ts , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ ali expressed similar points : if the results of both studies were brought together at home @-@ scale , talked about 90 % of the patients of both groups in the treatment .
in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go has been observed in the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ essen ( less filled in body tissues ) or infections , which were det@@ ectable or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation on the order .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) launched to conclude that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections in relation to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • in@@ fied little la@@ under@@ ation , de@@ ed or se@@ wn wo@@ unds .
in May 2007 the European Commission rus@@ hed to the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union .
patients in which two or three days are no improvement , should once again be examined and considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be the treatment is broken , the o@@ int@@ ment was carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ o@@ gens or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary wound , the effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ r@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , inadequate .
an alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2 @-@ day treatment no improvement or a deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the impact of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical pharmac@@ euticals is not recommended .
due to the low pl@@ asma rich@@ ness , which have been reached in people after top@@ ical application on be@@ dic@@ ed skin or infected superf@@ icial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .

due to the low @-@ system@@ ic exposure for top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not required to be required , if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reprodu@@ ci@@ ble tox@@ icity after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are insufficient with regards to a statement on the birth and the feder@@ ations / post@@ nat@@ ale development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indi@@ ces and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continues to be termin@@ ated or completed with Al@@ tar@@ go , is between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported field of confusion at the date of administration , which looked at about 1 % of the patients .

the drug mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective Hem@@ ation of the bacterial prot@@ ein@@ osis by interaction at a specific bond of the 50 sub @-@ unit of the bacterial re@@ bos@@ om , which diff@@ ers from the Bind@@ ing of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the bond of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bind@@ ing center and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Center .

should on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of the resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some inf@@ ecting forms may appear , a consultation by experts should be pursued .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in were .
in the case of a non @-@ speaking on treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes should be considered with additional Vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
absorption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be was given daily under Oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and on the mild skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary dental wo@@ unds , individual pl@@ asma was won .
the acceptance rate was carried out in days 3 or 4 during adult patients before implant@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours according to the previous application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic inclusion in people after top@@ ical use of 1 % Sal@@ be on 200 cm ² ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP im@@ itation .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human Leb@@ er@@ mi@@ k@@ ros@@ omas became primary thanks to CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of CY@@ P2@@ C8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity at rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive life and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between one and 15 years that are not imm@@ eas@@ ur@@ ably bound up against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within one out of two d@@ oses of existing vaccines , whereby the protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of a hep@@ atitis B infection and is ensured that the existing vaccines can be led to an end from two d@@ oses .
if a refres@@ her dose is designed against hep@@ atitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis @-@ A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine will be given .
vaccines have an effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) , as it can prevent against an illness .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the licensed vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved for Twin@@ rix children .
the three vaccines are applied to protect the same disease , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ering existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix includes identical ingredients , some of the data collected the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection .
in an additional trial with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led at between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection on the development of antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ aches , ap@@ et@@ it@@ em@@ gel , pain on the inj@@ ecting site , red@@ ness , mat@@ ness ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix is allowed to react hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) on the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) to not be applied .
August 2002 , the European Commission rus@@ hed to the company Gl@@ ax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. for the marketing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for gr@@ ati@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix is made of two vaccines , with the first dose of the election and the second dose is administ@@ ered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired both for hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B , it can vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ als vaccines or with a comb@@ ative vacc@@ inated vaccine .
the anti @-@ HC@@ V anti @-@ HC@@ V anti @-@ HC@@ V anti@@ gen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ body values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ als vaccines .
it is not yet completely assured , if immun@@ iz@@ able persons , who have addressed on a hep@@ atitis C , a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , as it is also protected with no longer refer@@ able antibodies to be protected by the immune memory .
3 How in all inj@@ ections should be available to the rare cases of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate ways of medical treatment and monitoring is always available immediately .
if a rapid protection against hep@@ atitis B is necessary , the standardi@@ zation system@@ ema is recommended with the Com@@ bine motors , the 360 ELISA units and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface anti@@ gen .
in Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ se@@ pati@@ enten and persons with disorders of the immune system , under circumstances no sufficient anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies is achieved , so in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ination can be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ e@@ al muscle could lead to an sub@@ optimal im@@ aging result , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in these cases in Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix cannot be in@@ compar@@ ably sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases for in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular circulation to ble@@ eding .

patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective needs to be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study , which was passed through 3 vacc@@ ination of this formulation in adults , was the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , sailors , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology , head@@ aches and fe@@ ver comparable to the frequency associated with the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccines .
20@@ 29 vaccines have been administ@@ ered by 20@@ 29 vaccines at the age of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ d@@ oses of combin@@ ant .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and sail@@ or on a calculation basis per vaccine dose ambi@@ rix but not based on a comp@@ utation of per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % with the pro@@ b@@ anden after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ d@@ oses of combin@@ ant .

the frequency of mat@@ ernity was however a pro@@ band comparable to ( that is , compared to the total vacc@@ inations at 39,@@ 6 % of the subjects that got Ambi@@ rix compared to 36.@@ 2 % with the prob@@ ands that received the 3 @-@ cans of combin@@ ation .
the frequency distinctive pain and in@@ activity was low and comparable that was observed after administration of the combined combined with the 3 @-@ d@@ oses vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study with 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccine was the appearance of local reactions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group , comparable with the 3 @-@ d@@ oses combination with 360 ELISA units and more 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface anti@@ gen .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was a common appearance of pain ( at the inj@@ ecting site ) per dose , not per proxy .
the proportion of vaccines that reported via severe side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ d@@ oses @-@ di@@ agrams with the drop @-@ d@@ oses of 360 ELI@@ SA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis C @-@ A surface anti@@ gen , was statist@@ ically different .

for the 28@@ 9 persons whose immune im@@ balance was more valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ary rates ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 , according to the gift of the 3 @-@ Dos@@ en@@ ant @-@ care is significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response that were achieved in a clinical trial phase at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after ter@@ mination of the full vacc@@ ination ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the table below .

you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ aded face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines the ambi@@ rix not fully protect against an infection with hep@@ atitis @-@ A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B virus , even when the complete vaccine with 2 cans was completed .
if you / your child are infected with hep@@ atitis @-@ A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus infected with hep@@ atitis @-@ A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B @-@ B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick ) , a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver or symptoms that are similar to those of hep@@ atitis @-@ A@@ - or Hepatitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you already have an allergic reaction to ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ eting skin rash , respir@@ atory or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • when with you / your child has ever performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • when you / your child have a serious infection with fe@@ ver / has .
• If you want to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the administration of the second vaccine ) .
if possible risk of an infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased content to effective components is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine before ending the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is suffering from people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle mass . • when you are weak@@ ened / your child based on a condition or treatment in your body with your own def@@ ende system , or if you / your child will under@@ go a her@@ es@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these instances , but the immune response of these persons on the vacc@@ ination cannot be adequate , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 S@@ ages your doctor if you are taking any other medicine / integrate ( including those who may have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated / was obtained or immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( anti@@ body ) or this is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient , and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as various limb@@ s .
if Ambi@@ rix is administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficiently .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women are not administ@@ ered unless it is urgent that they vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A as well as hep@@ atitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor when with you / your child already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccine , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been announced since issu@@ ing the first approval for the marketing agreement , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefits of risk @-@ risk for Ambi@@ rix will remain positive .
since Ambi@@ rix is only limited to a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data is limited to this medicine due to the low patient position .
Ammon@@ ites can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete end @-@ fat def@@ ect or with hyper@@ cli@@ ent@@ ele En@@ cep@@ hal@@ y ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ac@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations ) in the history .
Ammon@@ ite is - split into several single d@@ oses to meals - swal@@ lowed under food mixed or over a Gastro@@ enter@@ al t@@ avern ( through the stomach cover in the stomach of leading tube ) or a n@@ as@@ al onde ( through the nose in the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study since Ammon@@ ite did not compare with other treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a spot@@ light signal , that is to be compared without a drug ) .
Ammon@@ ites can also lead to loss of loss , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , anxiety , irrit@@ ation , head@@ ache , red@@ ness , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash , or weight gain .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) launched at the conclusion that Ammon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle to high ammon@@ ium values effectively prevents .
Ammon@@ ites was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , since due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine .
the use is inde@@ xed to all patients with which the entire En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel has already manifest@@ ed itself in the new year old ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with bel@@ ated form ( in@@ complete end@@ omet@@ ric def@@ ect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first life of life ) , then there is a indication for use when in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ ar@@ dent en@@ cep@@ hal@@ y .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with gor@@ ging disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein @-@ toler@@ ance and growth and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with her@@ on @-@ growing and adult .
in patients who suffer at an early man@@ if@@ ying lack of car@@ b@@ yl phosph@@ ate synthe@@ tic or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or Arg@@ in@@ ine is necessary in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ app@@ ucc@@ ase lack must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0,4 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets must not be administ@@ ered with lo@@ op@@ ia , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets are not immediately getting into the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum d@@ osis .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore in@@ suff@@ ice with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with so@@ dium ret@@ ention and oil @-@ formation conditions , only with caution .
since met@@ abolic and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate about the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these findings in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
for sub@@ cut@@ aneous types of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high Dos@@ age ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a stressed loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a del@@ ayed irrit@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning ner@@ ves in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated by humans into the mother &apos;s milk , and this reason is the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the lact@@ ation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients had at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ ebox , Pan@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie , periph@@ er@@ als neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ turn appeared in a 5 month old to@@ d@@ dler with an acci@@ d@@ osis of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed with an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of d@@ oses to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic disease connecting with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is eliminated by the kid@@ neys .
pus@@ h@@ omet@@ ric is seen as phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with U@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative sponsor for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that for each gramm@@ es , so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0,12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ rogen .
it is important that diagnosis is placed at an early stage and the treatment immediately started to improve the prospects of survival and the clinical result .
progn@@ osis of the early @-@ manifest@@ ed form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms experienced in the new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ at@@ ist , and the disease resulted in treatment with per@@ one@@ one@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their embro@@ ider@@ y @-@ free an@@ alogue within the first year of death .
by Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ se , the exploitation of altern@@ ate paths of nit@@ rogen calcium ( so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ment reduced and any sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rates of new bor@@ row@@ ful at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life of life ) diagnosed in 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rates were 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many too spiritual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with bel@@ ated form of the disease ( including feminine patients with the het@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ otes form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase @-@ lack ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium arc@@ tic leu@@ ka@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ment reduced diet , the over@@ rate was 98 % .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur further deteri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ical states .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is composed in liver and Ni@@ ere enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and of its Met@@ abol@@ ites in pl@@ asma and Ur@@ in were determined in so@@ dium healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle , the her@@ mo@@ ist rh@@ osis after item , as well as repet@@ itive gifts of or@@ alen d@@ oses from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also investigated with cancer victims of the intra@@ ven@@ ous genes of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing meas@@ urable pl@@ asma is determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary medicines or hem@@ ro@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , after different d@@ oses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after night @-@ visual fast@@ ing no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate was in pl@@ asma .
at three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three sol@@ d@@ oses ) , the medium @-@ sized phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate con@@ dens@@ ities in pl@@ asma on the third day five times higher than after the first g@@ aps .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gi@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine about the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no cl@@ oc@@ ate effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules is taken either by oral ( inf@@ ants and children , which can still not swal@@ low the tablets , or patients with lo@@ y@@ dis@@ rup@@ eds ) or via a p@@ ale st@@ ical st@@ ine .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ born child , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with her@@ on @-@ growing and adult .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ prot@@ one in pl@@ asma should be held within the normal area .
in patients who suffer at an early man@@ if@@ ying lack of car@@ b@@ yl phosph@@ ate synthe@@ tic or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or Arg@@ in@@ ine is necessary in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum d@@ osis .
when rap@@ ins were subjected to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , there came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ ks .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ ebox , Pan@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie , periph@@ er@@ als neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
pus@@ h@@ omet@@ ric is seen as phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with U@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore ideal as an alternative to ex@@ cre@@ ting the ex@@ cre@@ tion of bub@@ bles
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that for each gramm@@ es , so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0,12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ rogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible in treatment , and in some patients may occur further deteri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ical states .
after a oral single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable pl@@ us@@ ec@@ es of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of the shelf the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C .
in this procedure includes the small measurement spo@@ on 0.95 g , the middle semi @-@ spo@@ on 2,9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ri@@ but@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is dis@@ solved before use also in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enz@@ ym@@ es are lacking certain live @-@ enz@@ ym@@ es , so that they accum@@ ulate the intake of proteins in the body after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are going to be carried out in the laboratory testing , you need to notify the doctor that you take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .

An@@ gi@@ ox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar in the heart ) , for example with inst@@ ile Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ os ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measuring value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or E@@ KG ) .
will An@@ gi@@ ox applied to prevent cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI Express , a higher dosage is administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow and enhance the effectiveness of a PCI .
approxim@@ ating 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of det@@ ox inj@@ ectors , or in connection with a gly@@ co@@ red @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI was compared .
during PCI the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube stays , which remains in the arter@@ ie in order to prevent a closure ) , and they received additionally other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots , such as waste tor@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS there An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , coron@@ ary accidents or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days and a year as effective as traditional treatment .
in patients who has subjected to an PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy blood vessels , with which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox cannot be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other past@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it must not be applied in patients who recently had a ble@@ eding , as well as people with heavy hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or cardi@@ ac infection .
the committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) launched to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an ann@@ ar@@ er replacement for hep@@ arin is .
September 2004 , the European Commission divided the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox within the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ trial attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) with an emergency room or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended Initi@@ ation dose of An@@ gi@@ ox at patients with ACS is a intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ement of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is performed in further a result , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and inf@@ usion to the duration of the surgery on 1.75 mg / kg / h .
after PCI you can return to clinical requirements again the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bol@@ ster of 0.5 mg / kg can be administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with an PCI consists of a initial intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ b of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and an incidence of an immediate intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a single bolt @-@ gift by An@@ gi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value is short@@ ened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) on less than 225 seconds , a second con@@ versions of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight should be made .
in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitute and dil@@ uted drugs before the application was carefully mixed and the bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis swi@@ ftly can be administ@@ ered swi@@ ftly .
once the ACT value is worth more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer necessary , provided the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administ@@ ered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney exercise , ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to an PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h .
lies the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0,3 mg / kg and will rest@@ art the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again .
in patients with moderate kidney disease , which resulted in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ 2 ) , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ bolt without dosage adjustment on average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients is An@@ gi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see under Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after ter@@ mination of the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of un@@ fr@@ action@@ ated hep@@ arin , or 8 hours after ter@@ mination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous mol@@ t of the molecular hep@@ arin .
• Eff@@ ective hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active or other components or against pen@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or increased blood pressure risk . • heavy un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ ordin@@ ate bacterial infection . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are observed during treatment carefully in terms of symptoms and signs of blood circulation , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if there occur in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most ble@@ eding on arter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ation cases ( PCI ) under@@ go , during the treatment in principle everywhere ble@@ eding occur .
in patients , the war@@ far@@ in are taken and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should consider a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Standards for rati@@ o ) to ensure that the value after deriv@@ ation of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be achieved before the treatment existing level .
starting from the knowledge of the drug mechanism of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tika or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ag@@ greg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) it can be assumed that these ingredients increase the blood flow .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , juven@@ iles and children from six years with diabetes , which require a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the stomach wall , the thig@@ h or the upper arm inj@@ ected or considered permanent inf@@ usion with a ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin for the regulation of gl@@ uc@@ ose ( sugar ) produced in the blood or the ins@@ ulin cannot process effectively .
ins@@ ulin gene in terms of ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter period of time is regarded as a short @-@ effective Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes where the body can &apos;t produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type @-@ 2 diabetes , where the body ins@@ ulin is not effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at ins@@ ulin per .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 30 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % for human standards .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin or any other components , or in patients who are already suffering from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicinal products , which can affect the glu@@ ing seal .
September 2004 , the European Commission rus@@ hed to the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Avent@@ is Germany GmbH for approval of the marketing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is known as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the area of the ab@@ dom@@ inal cover , the Ober@@ sch@@ enk@@ els or the Del@@ tam@@ us@@ cles , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous with continuous inf@@ usion in the field of ab@@ dom@@ inal cord .
due to the decreased glu@@ ed @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ishing ins@@ ulin delivery could be the ins@@ ulin demand in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the active thickness , the brand ( her@@ etics ) , of ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , gal@@ van@@ izing , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the method method can draw a change of ins@@ ulin delivery .
3 . insufficient dosage or loss of treatment , in particular in patients with a ins@@ ulin in@@ portable diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic cure ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin in another manufacturer should take place under str@@ ingent medical supervision and may make a change of dosage necessary .
the time of re@@ ap@@ ing of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change in switching the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that can increase the ble@@ eding activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics , oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , Fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ oxet@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ant , Pen@@ tox@@ if@@ y@@ lin , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , rop@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ phon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics such as Bet@@ lock@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ dine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reser@@ pine the symptoms of the no@@ rep@@ air@@ ment was weak@@ ened or ab@@ sent .
Tier@@ experimental studies for re@@ loc@@ ating tox@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin , in relation to pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ ale development ( see Section 5.3 ) .

after a gl@@ uc@@ al injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to investigate the Ur@@ - cause for the severe hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces the blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the periph@@ eral of gl@@ uc@@ ose ( especially through sk@@ elet@@ al muscles and fat ) as well as through the im@@ itation of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
