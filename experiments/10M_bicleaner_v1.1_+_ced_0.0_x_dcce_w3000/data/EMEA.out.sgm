<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR), which explains how the studies done to human resources (CHMP) conducted studies to advise recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package board (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or a pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that are dissolved in the mouth) as a solution to the deposit (1 mg / ml) and as an injection resolution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirl thinking and Speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not present), distrust and insanity; • Bipolar disorder, a psychological disorder, in which the patients have manic episodes (Periods anormaler Hochstimmung) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of severe to severe manic episodes, and to the prevention of manic episodes in patients suffering from the past to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injecting solution is applied for quick control of confiscated unrest or behavioural disorders when the oral ingestion of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution to the entry or the melting-coated tablets can be applied in patients with the gorge of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who simultaneously take other medicines that are just as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works primarily as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitters appears to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role, carries Aripiprazol to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and will prevent their reoccur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent the repercussions of symptoms, was investigated in three studies until one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that compared to conflicted unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was ratified over twelve weeks to 347 patients with semi-eril, in a different study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo, to prevent repercussions in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injecting solution was carried out in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder which suffered from ineiving unrest, with that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change in symptoms of patients were based on a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suffering from the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body reimburns the melting-tray and the solution to the incorporation.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injecting solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms gestant inagitation than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In application for the treatment of bipolar disorder decreased Abilify in four of the five short-term studies are more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also fettered up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the reoccur manic episodes carried out during previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg cans were also more effective than placebo the symptoms gested unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify on the entry (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale interference (uncontrolleness), tremor (sley), anxiety, nausea (nausea), saliva hypersecretion (enhanced saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Humanarztants (CHMP) launched to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia, and in prevention of a new Ottoman episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes of the treatment with Aripiprazol said to weigh on the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injecting solution in quick control of conflicated unrest and behavioural disorders associated with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable towards the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission divided the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new Ottoman episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes of treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended incleosis for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosing over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended initial dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients aged 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower Initiation osis should be considered clinical factors (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-Indutractor is set out of the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after the change of an anti-psychological therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased Suicide disorder with Aripiprazol in comparison to other antipsychic medication.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be applied with caution among patients with known cardiovascular disease, cardiac intoxication, respiratory disorders, conditions, which are applied for hypotonie (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure drugs) or hypertension (including akzelerated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which received a year or less persistent, there were occasional reports of during the treatment with Aripiprazol muting dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">When in one with ABILIFY treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient appears signs and symptoms, which impaired to a mns, or inclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, must be abolished all the antipsychic medication, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazol should be used in patients with coronary cases in anamnese or at states that are used with crampments which are used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis who were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, an elevated risk to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was however, in one of these studies, a study with fixing Dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted feebrovascular events with Aripiprazol-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazionale or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients suffering with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related incidents in with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic medication-treated patients who permit direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, Polyurie, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder, the use of antipsychotic medication where weight gain is known as a side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines that may be taken as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonist Famotidin, a stomach acid-blocker, reduces the resorpation rate of Aripiprazol, however this effect is regarded as clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy prostagnates a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinese inhibitor) the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107%, while the Cmax stayed unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be done similar tin reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") Metabolizing, the common application can result with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma-CPU compared to CYP2D6 extensional Metabolisation.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you take into account the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protector inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be done similar tin reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After stating the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors should be lifted the dosage of ABILIFY to the dosage prior to the beginning of the term therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Dilanazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies revealed Cans from 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day no significant effect on the metabolic disorders of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dextromethaman-Ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethamine).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for the safety of people and because of the concerns raised in reproduction, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits do not produce the potential risk to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, even in other antipsychotic medicines, patients should be warned of, dangerous machines, including fuel vehicles, to operate, until they are certain that Aripiprazol have no negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the below listed side effects is defined after the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study was treated with patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a total of reduced incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonismus, Akhaisie, Dystonie and Dyskinesia, compared to patients who were treated with semi-eril (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% amounted to patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS increased by 14.8% in patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - in a controlled trial over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under half-term treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% amounted to patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During long term savings phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo on which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters, revealed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, Spätdyskinesia and Krampfancies, undesirable events and increased mortality in older dementia people, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the launch of unintentional antidosidings were accidentally observed with Aripiprazol alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the effectiveness of a heresalysis in the treatment of exaggeration with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that Hämodialysis is produced in the treatment of an overdization of benefits, since Aripiprazol is a high plasma connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol is conveyed with schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder about the combination of a participative influence on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and 5HT2a receptor as well as an excessive affinity to the Dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-repentor and to the Histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With gift of Aripiprazol in doses from 0,5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy probanden, the Positons emission-shareholm showed a dose-dependent decline of the bond of 11C-Racloprid, an D2 / D3 receptor league, on the nucleus caudatus and cruising.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three Placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazol compared to placebo a statistically significant increase of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidre-controlled trial was 52 of the proportion of respondence to patients who were talking about the study media, in both groups similar to Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from messscales, which were defined as secondary study, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depressants, showed a significant stronger improvement than with Haloperidl.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed themselves a significant higher reduction of backinstallment, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study conducted at schizophrzol (N = 18 or 13% of valuable patients) with significantly less patient a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output (i.e. an increase from at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of approx.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazole a over placebo excessive effectiveness in reducing real symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixing dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazol against placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboy and active-controlled monotherapy studies on 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol showed a compared to placebo excessive effectiveness in week 3 and a clue effect that was comparable to that of lithium, or half-erior in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week Aripiprazol also proved to be a comparative proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie on how lithium and Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic properties, which partly over 2 weeks not on lithians or Valproat-Monotherapie in Therapy Serummirror, found the companion therapy with Aripiprazole a superior effectiveness in reducing real symptoms compared to the monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-time expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase before Randomisation showed themselves Aripiprazol against placebo largely considering the prevention of a bipolar regimet, predominantly in preventing a back into the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro-studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is responsible for dehydration and hydroxyction of Aripiprazol, which is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle elimination time is approximate 75 hours for Aripiprazol over CYP2D6 and approximate 146 hours at 'poor' (= "poor") Metabolisation about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacoptics between male and female healthy Probanden, as well as a pharmacological investigation of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific analysis to pharmaceutical macro inetics found no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin, or the effect of smoking on pharmacetics from Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacological characteristics of Aripiprazol and hydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">An unleosis study at Probanden (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazol and Dehhydro-Aripiprazole, but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to pull out conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety spreadable toxicity, toxicity at repetitive Gabe, reproducitoxicity, Genotoxicity, and to the canodious potential the preclinical data let no particular dangers originating from humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were only observed at dosing or expositions which exceeds the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they have only limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>

<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis has been established as a result of the levelling of sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazol in the Galle by monkey to repeated oraltitudes from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81mm of the recommended maximaldosis in man based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human Galle in the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol not more than 6% of concentrations, which were detected in the study of over 39 weeks in the Galle by monkeys, and lie far under the limit values (6%) of the vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosing, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11fachen of the mid Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical Maximumosis, observed.</seg>

<seg id="291">Abraxane may cause effects of fatigue (very frequently) and vertigo (common), which can impact on the traffic and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">In the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects shown in 229 patients with metastatic mammakarcinoma who were treated in the pivotal clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abrasion.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenie was the most remarkable important hematological toxicity (if 79% of patients reported) and was quick reversible and dosisdependent; Leukopenie was reported at 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (HB &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of the patients with abrasive patients and was severe in three cases (HB &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>

<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of oversensitivity can be calculated based on a definite in context in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, there are no estimates of actual frequency possible and it was not established any cold connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antickrotubules substance, which promotes the contamination of the microtubules from the tubes of the tubes and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibition of their deportation.</seg>
<seg id="303">These stabilisation leads to a imitation of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubulary network that is essential for the vital practice phase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin the Transzytosis of Plasmaomponents being conveyed in the endothelm cells and in the frame of in-vitro studies has been proven that the presence of Albumin the transportation of paclitaxel promotes the endothelm cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is thought that this improved transendotheliale transport through the gp-60-Albuminesreceptor is conveys and due to the albuminbinds Proteins SPARC (indited protein acidic rich in cysteine) in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic mammakargalom is supported by data of 106 patients in two singular studies and 454 patients, which were treated in a randomised phase-III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients were treated with metastatic mammakarcinoma with Abraxane, which was given in the form of infusion of 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>

<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and ß, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bone and excretion about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h 39 ± 16% of the abused dose is in urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total-body Clearance is independent of the dose 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains uninfluenced by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Zoledroneous concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no impact on the surface area under the curve (plasma resistant to time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance by Cytochrome-P450-enzymaker metabolized substances is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not yet metabolized by humans, and because they are a faint or even no direct and / or irreversibly, metabolic-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient-groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledronic acid is correlated with the creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine Clearance, and was for 64 underexamined patients in the average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">It arises that a light (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and an excessive kidney function up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the Zoledronic acid requires.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe kidney-functioning (creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available for this populations.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR) which is described as the Committee on Humanarztmedium (CHMP) conducted studies to consult recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Accounts is applied for treatment of type-2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent patients). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in which metformin (a diabetesmedial ament) is not shown. • It can be applied together with another Diabetesmedikament (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can additionally be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) which can be customized with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphylactic or insulin, the previous dose of sulphylactic acid or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the accounts (low blood sugar); here the dose of sulphylactic acid or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body can be improved and improved its own insulin, thus allowing the blood sugar levels to better adjust to type-2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in Tripleas was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphylresin, in addition they received either an account of up to 3.5 years either from accounts or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glykosylized hemmoglobin, HbA1c) measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Accounts led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which makes the blood sugar lowering in the use of dosing capacity of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletion trial, the effect of the extra gift of accounts for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphyllinitrogen in lowering the HbA1c values around 0,94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0,35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of accounts and insulin in 289 patients were examined, patients, the accounts in addition to insulin, a reduction of HbA1c values of 45% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side-effects in connection with accounts were tances, infections of the upper airways (colds), weight gain and hypoanaesthesia (diminished sensitivity to irritating).</seg>
<seg id="760">Accounts should not be used in patients who may not be hypersensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazon or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, insufficiency or diabetischer ketoaziebox (high vibrational levels - acidar levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos in the framework of a monotherapy (for the sole use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients is to serve as a metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission parted the European Commission Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for approval for the marketing of accounts in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until moderate, round, domed and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the wording "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also shown for combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin, and in which metformations is inappropriate (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">The application of Pioglitazon for patients under 18 years of age are not available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. former coronary heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of insufficiency, weight gain or odeme, especially those with reduced cardialer reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of insufficiency, weight gain and odeme, if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced makrovascular disorder has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study there showed an increase in reports of insufficiency, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output levels of liver (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver illness, Pioglitazone should not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-Spiegel increases up to 3-times the limit of the standard range, the liver values are to be controlled again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient developed symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unresolved exercise, fatigue, buttonlessness and / or darker resn, the liver ailments are to check.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the patient's treatment should be continued with Pioglitazon, should be led to the requirements of the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven to stir of liabilities and in some cases with a fluid.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a heritlution, under the therapy with Pioglitazon, a slight reduction of the middle hemmoglobinations (relative reduction of 4%) and the hematocrits (relative reduction of 4.4%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparatively controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemotherapy in order to 3,6-4.1%) and to a lower scale even in patients under sulphylharnite and insulin (relative reduction of hemmoons by 1-2% and the hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-sensitivity consists of patients who Pioglitazone is used as oral dual or tripletion therapy with a sulphonecharnrogen or as a dual-form Combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch was reported under the treatment with Thiazolidindians, including Pioglitazon, on a appearance or a deterioration of a diabetic maculaödems with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there are a direct link between the intake of Pioglitazon and the appearance of Makulaödems, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of a Makulaödems if patient reported on disorders of visual sharpness; a suitable ophthalmologic evaluation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of undesirable events in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 cargo-value per 100 patient-years with Pioglitazon to be treated with Pioglitazon treated with Pioglitazon, for 100 patients with women, which were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, they were treated with Pioglitazon, compared with Pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Retures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this one is taking care of it (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for examining the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the Pharmacoinetic or Pharmodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymaboces, i.e. orale contraceptive, cyclosporin, calcium hydrogen and HMGCoA reducers are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulting in an increase in AUC from Pioglitazon to the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with rifampicon (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 Actor) resulting in a reduction of AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to that under treatment with Pioglitazon used in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance to the uterine and thereby diminished the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal system.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the Turgors and the indexes of the lens, as it also observed in other hypoglycaemic substance.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone advocated over the triple-fold of the upper limit of normaliases often to such as placebo but less common than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphyllinitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with previously advanced makrovascular diseases, the incidence of severe herinsufficiency at Pioglitazon was 1,6% higher than among placebo if Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch of market insufficiency, Pioglitazone reports, more common, however, if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with insufficiency in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It became a summarised analysis of reports undesirable events in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated in groups and over 7,400 patients treated in contracted groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, framing at 44 / 870 (5,1%) who were treated with Pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="797">In taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, after 180 mg. daily over seven days there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Perioxidiomas Proliferator Activated Receptor-g (PPAR-g)), which leads to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces the Glucosity production in the liver and increases the peripheral Glucosities in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the retrofit of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ (8.0% after the first 6 treatments).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after starting treatment a blood pressure control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon at 69% of patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebokontrolulated study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were randomised despite three-month optimissive phase with insulin, to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon reduced the mean HbA1c value, compared to patients who remains only insulin, compared with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, at Pioglitazone showed themselves a statistically significant reduction in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotional compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks study conducted on type-2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglycoeride and the free fatty acids and a rise of the HDL- cholesterol levels as well as lower, however clinically not statistically increased LDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazide the total plasmatriglycoeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo under Pioglitazon was no statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels, while under metformin and extremclazid decreased values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study about 20 weeks reduced pioglitazon not only the sober triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial raised triglyceride level, this is both an effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglycemic synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular output study, 5238 patients were randomised with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced makrovascular disorder in groups, which were given over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is quickly resorbiased, whereby the leading concentric Pioglitazone is normally reached in plasma 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution from M-IV to the effectiveness in about triple the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interactions studies could be proven that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the Pharmacoinetic or Pharmodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 Actor) or lowers the Plasmaoncentric of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive maroglitazon in humans, the marker was found mainly in the subjects (55%) and to a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The middle plasma-elimination period of unchanged pioglitazon amounts to people 5-6 hours, and which is the entire active metabolic rate at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma-zentrations of Pioglitazon and its Metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy Probanden, whereby the frying of the oral Clearance of the mother substance however resemble.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred with mice, rats, dogs and ape concurring to repeated administration, plasma-volume, with hered, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to that under treatment with Pioglitazon which diminishes in the gestation hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance to the uterine and thus reduce the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal system.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced at the rat increased incidence of hyperplasia (with male and female rats) and tumors (with male rats) of the uretic epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the familiar adenomatous polyposis (FAP) conducted treatment with two other Thiazolidindions to an increased frequency of colontics.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white until moderate, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the wording "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 cargo-value per 100 patient-years with Pioglitazon to be treated with Pioglitazon treated with Pioglitazon, for 100 patients with women, which were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, they were treated with Pioglitazon, compared with Pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Retures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years the effects of the combination therapy of metformin each have been studied with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, the Pioglitazon showed themselves a statistically significant reduction in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotional compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study about 20 weeks reduced pioglitazon not only the sober triglyceride level, but improved the postprandial raised triglyceride level, this is both an effect on the Tryglycemic absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglicer synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the goal with regard to its primary endpoint, stroke, infloopation above the ankle, coronation Revascularization and Revascularisation of the near arteries, specify the results that using Pioglitazon no cardiovascular disease risk.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients, should arrange this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of systemic exposure of Tacrolim, this may lead to transplant loss or increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolim formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; ortions of the formulation or the regime should only be done under the narrow-machine control of one in the transplant experienced physician (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a result of switching to an alternative formulation, needs to be carried out a therapeutic medication and corresponding dosage adjustment to ensure that the systemic exposition of Tacrolim remains intact.</seg>

<seg id="1434">Blood-Talking of Tacrolim should also change after switching from Prograf on Advagraf, dosage adjustment, amendments of immunosuppressive therapy or at simultaneous use of substances, which could change the Tacrolim thoroughing circulation (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a medicine with a low Clearance, adjustments to the dose can take several days until the steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials are expected to conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the reservoir in the blood 20 ng / ml do not exceed.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the talents of Tacrolimus usually lie in full bloom in the first time following liver transplants, usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and nesting - and heart transplants patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">While the subsequent treatment of liver, kidney and heart transplans have usually been blood-centralized in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe undesirable events, including Transplanchrepentations or other side effects, which can occur in a result of Tacrolim subor transexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolim formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; ortions of the formulation or the regime should only be done under the narrow-machine control of one in the transplant experienced physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are an already existing cardiac disease, a treatment with cortical problems, hypertension, kidney or liver functioning, infections, hydration, and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressiva, the effect of sunlight or UV-light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to the appropriate clothing or using a radiator factor.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data from first-marketing data, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits of risk prevention, but considering that the safety profile should be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP is necessary on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE which is required for a filing from PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorization of authorisation has to request another renewal of authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited signed the Committee for Humanarztints (CHMP) officially recognizes that the company withdraws his application for approval for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, are the breasts, the brain, the bones or the grain parts (tissues that connects other structures in the body, surrounds and supports) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In Advexin, it is a "Adenovirus" that has changed so that there is no copies of itself and thus do not trigger any infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">For exexin would have turned directly into the tumors and thus allow cancer cells to make the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the unbroken inside the human body existing p53 gene, is usually contributing to the restoration of corrupt DNA and killing the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-cancer in which the p53 gene is broken, the p53 protein is not correct, and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share.</seg>

<seg id="1648">After the CHMP did the answers of the company on the questions asked, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initial documents submitted papers, the CHMP is created on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin at Li-Fraumeni-Tumors takes advantage for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration, as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not proven sufficiently demonstrated that Advance can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notice the CHMP, whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients has currently taking part in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advance.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed substance release" "" "means that the tablets are so merged that one of the effective components left immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is applied to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhinitis (hypography), by an allergy to pollen (inflammation of the nasal paths) in patients with asnasuderous swelling (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and young people aged 12 years, the recommended dose of aerinaze twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose-endometrium (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be diminished by the stipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main contributor were the changes of the severity of hay treatment symptoms which were reported by patients before starting treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scala, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all haksuction symptoms, besides the stipation of the nose, patients reported the aeronze, over a decrease in symptoms of 46.0%, compared with 35,9% in patients who captured pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-endometrium was reported, patients showed below Aerinaze a alleviation of symptoms around 37,4% compared to the patients who took desloratine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachykardie (heart illness), harmonicity, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), adenitis, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeness), somnolence (sleeness), sleeping disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze is allowed in patients who may not be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, to repent agents or loratine (another medicine to treat allergies) are not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aeryze may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a Engvinkelglaucoma (elevated eye pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases (hypertension of the thyroid) or already had a hemorrhoea stroke (caused by brain blood vessels) or have a risk for a hemorrhoea stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission rushed to the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is basically to swallow (i.e. without it to break, break or to chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should be applied due to misconception and effectiveness (see section 5.1) are not used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not be continued according to the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended that limit the time of application to 10 days because at long-term, the activity of pseudoephedrine can take off with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the decline of the swelling of the veil in the upper airways, the treatment can be continued when needed with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Da aerinaze Pseudoephedrine includes, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients suffering from a monoaminoxidase (MAO) or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributed to the alphamimetic activity in combination with other vaso-morphines like bromocripitin, pergoid, Diihydrogas, Dihydroergotamine or other Dekongestiva, phenylephrine, Ephedrine, Oxymetazoline, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and the effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for that patient care and the data are not enough to address relevant recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aeryze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to express appropriate recommendations on dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed about the treatment in the incidence of hypertension or tachycardiac or coronary arrhythmia, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or etwaigen other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or reinforcement of the headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of subsequent patients, patients are advised to be treated: • patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmia • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocaricattack in Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder empathy or bronze in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before conducting matological testing, since Antihistaminika will otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with Desloratine, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol have also been administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma-sanitation has been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests, there were no significant differences between the patients with desloratine and the patients treated with placebo irrespective of whether it has been taken by desloratadine alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadine is not identified yet, so that interactions with other medicines could not be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not hemmed and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P glycoredone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconceivable of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies however, however, no increase in the frequency of abnormalities when compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals can not always be transmitted to humans and due to the vasostriktortic properties of pseudoephedrine should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be explained about it, that in very rare cases it can come to a stuper, which can lead to impairment or the ability to use machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a zNS-depression (sealing, apnea, diminished spiritual attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular-collaps) and a zNS abuity (sleeplessness, hallucinations) with possible letys contentations.</seg>

<seg id="1688">Eine ZNS-stimulation is particularly likely like atropin-typical symptoms (oral drying, pupillary) and - dilatation, skin-redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the imitation of the release of pro-inflammatory Zytokens as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the Adhesive P-Selectin at Endothelm.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In an unledose study involving adults showed Desloratine 5 mg has no influence on standard measuring ranges of fludecomposition, including strengthening subjective endness or the tasks linked to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage was detected at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily with no increased frequency compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can give further sympathomatic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachykardie or manifestations of a TNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Had received 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients Aerinaze tablets received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determined by the total cores for the symptom (except nasuproal swelling), significant higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nose-sskin-swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of an unleosis study on the Pharmacyinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratine is detectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze at healthy Probanden about 14 days, the fluidity of Desloratine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and Pseudoephedrine an day 10 was reached.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacopoetic multi-microdosisstudie, which was performed with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult prospective, has been found that four probanden desloratadine badly receded.</seg>
<seg id="1700">One component Interaction that shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine after the allergy of Pseudoephedrine biovalence was for exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety spreadiness, for toxicity at repetitive Gabe, for Genotoxicity and for reproduction, the preclinical data with desloratine make no particular danger to man.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-term studies the combination of Loratine / Pseudoephedrine was in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogenic.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. the Committee for Humanarztints (CHMP) officially argued that the company has its application to permit approval for the prevention of Aflunov to the prevention of aviary H5N1-influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied in adults and older people to protect influenza, which is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 from the influenza-A-virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a future pandemic virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza breaks out when a new trunk of the flu takes up, which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine the immune system recognises the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the human vaccine as" "" "body foreign" "" "and forms the antibody against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">In this way the immune system is later able to form in contact with a grippevirus of this tribe faster antibody.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane enveloping the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as body alien), and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This caused the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the security of the vaccine to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in clinical trials and need more information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency Virus Typ 1 (HIV-1), which are infected with the acquired immuno Syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to the admission, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be enacted when the doctor has checked, which antiviral medicine has previously taken previously, and the likelihood of viruses will address the virus on the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of aging is based on the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Aging is reduced in combination with other antiviral drugs the HIV amounts in blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS not to heal, however, it may delay the immune system, and thus also the development of with AIDS connected infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase has been studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults, who had previously been treated with a release.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low dosionized Ritonavir increased medicine Agenerase was compared with 206 adults who had previously taken the release of the release with other protectors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indikator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-evidence concentrations of HIV in the blood (Viruslast) or the change in Viruslast after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protector, after 48 weeks under Agenerase, more patients had less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than inonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children decreased Agenerase also decreased the viral last, although with the children, who were previously treated with protector, only very few of the treatment mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults, which had been treated earlier with protector, lowered with Ritonavir enhanced drug Agenerase inhibiting to 16-week treatment just as effective as other protector:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other prototyping brake resistant, it came under Agenerase along with Ritonavir to a stronger decline of Viral last to four weeks than with the patients who took their previous protector release:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (arrhoea), Flatulence (infiless), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against amusor or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be applied in patients, the currants (a herbal supplements to treat depression) or medicines that are just as well as Agenase and are to be harmful in high concentrations in the blood health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, the Agenerase inhibitors the risk of an podystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), an osteatrous tissue (symptoms of bone tissue) or an immunoactive synchronous drug (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Humanarztants (CHMP) launched to conclude that the benefits of aging in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years towards the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken along with the pharmacoetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee proved that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously taken no protector, not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenase was originally approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances," "" "as the approval of scientific reasons for scientific reasons was proposed only." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000, the European Commission parted the European Commission of Glaxo Group Limited grant permission for the marketing of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protector, regulator adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually Agenerase capsules are to be administered by pharmaceuphinetic Boosterung on Amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amppreneurr should be carried out under consideration of the individual viral Resistence and Pretreatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of ampprenavir as a solution to the one is less than 14% less than by Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore Agenerase capsules and solution to insertion on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg of amusr twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. when Agenerase capsules are applied without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (boosterung), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg of amppreneurr / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amphavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The Pharmacopinetics, effectiveness and safety of Agenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protectors were not tested in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the misuse of data to be thoughtfulness and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacological data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions on 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be done in patients with mild or moderate living-functioning with caution, in patients with severe living-functioning it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not simultaneously be given with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of Cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements containing currants (hypericum perforatum), may not be used due to the risk of reduced Plaspragnations and a diminished therapeutic effect of ampprenavir during the intake of ampprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that aging or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure from HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually Agenase capsules are to be used along with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, have an increased risk for heavy liver surfaces with potentially fatal disease course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of simultaneous anti-viral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please consult the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatitis liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver functioning under a antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticason or other glucoeutics that is not recommended above CYP3A4 per, unless that the possible benefit of a treatment reduces the risk of systemic corieroider effects including morbus Cusps and supplements of the adrenal function. (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reduction of CYP3A4 is dependent, simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and simvastatin because of the increased risk of Myopathies, including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For several medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and Warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards Ratio), methods are available for determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective due to decreased plasma-stones of ampprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with ampprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills may be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given at the same time with payers, patients should therefore be monitored on Opiatchasing symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of a toxicity, because of the potential risk of a toxicity, because of the high propylenglycolhalts of the Agenase solution, this intestine form is contraindicated in children under the age of four years and should be used with caution at certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenase should be eliminated at duration 5 if a rash may be accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including protector, was reported on the appearance of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exacitiation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases which were required to treat drugs which are associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or a hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer continuous antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">With hammophiles patients (type A and B), which were treated with proteins, are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutters, haematology and hemosteoarthritis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At HIV infected patients with severe immune defect may develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, which leads to severe clinical states or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial aetiology is accepted (including application of cortikosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosualties, higher Body-Mass-Index), were reported cases of osteatrous in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term treatment of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with lower therapeutic width Agenerase should not simultaneously possess medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of Cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be combined with pharmaceuticals whose active ingredients are predominantly dimmed over CYP2D6 and for the increased plasma-seals with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin is a 82% reduction in AUC by Amprenavir that can lead to a virologic understanding and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to compensate the low-low plasma through a dosage adjustment of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johannisite (Hypericum perforatum) The Serummirror of ampprenavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with Johannisite (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient has already installed currants, the payroll is checked and when it is possible to verify the Viruses and picks the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the pharmaceuticals is not required when Nelumavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirency below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax by 30% lower, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with Amusr capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses were applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and unimaginable of this treatment schemata.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower, when Améavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of ampmakers in plasma (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amusr (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A metering recommendations for the simultaneous administration of ampprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is widely recommended but a widespread monitoring is not known as the effectiveness and unobjectionable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacological study conducted on the application of Adanosin combination with Didanosin, however, is advised due to the antacid component of Didanosin, however, that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase lie at least an hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">That is why the gift of Efavirency is required in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirency in combination with ampprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins extenders would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protector, and existing limited data let suspected that Nevirapine may possibly lowers the Serumkonzentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is advisable because Delavirdin because of the decreased and possibly subtherapeutic plasma could be less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virologic monitoring should be made, as an exact forecast of the effect of combination of ampprenavir and Ritonavir is difficult to detect on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of ampmakers and rifabutin led to a rise in plasma-center (AUC) of Rifabutin at 193% and thus a rise in connected with megfabutin connected side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, rifabutin together with Agenerase is to be administered at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, but the plasma-stones of both medicinal products could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in an increase in Cmax by ketoconazole in plasma compared to the value, which was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, if they are applied together with Agenerase, potentially lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions that are linked to these drugs, if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protector, it is advisable that Antazida is not taken at the same time as Agenerase, since it can come to Resortment disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulva, known as enzymers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with ampprenavir may lead to a humiliation of the plasma systems of ampprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum trainstations of calcium channels, such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipin, Nicodipin, Notdipin, Nisoldipin and Verapamil may be increased 10 by Amprenavir, thereby reducing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous ingestion with aging can increase their plasma-centralized and increase using PDE5 inhibitors in connection-related side effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4-times daily) over 7 days of trial period, while the Endticasonpropionat intranasal decreased by approximately 86% (90% -connectivity interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these Glucoeutics, unless that the potential benefits of a treatment reduces the risk of systemic corieroider effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoG reductase inhibitor, such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is heavily dependent of CYP3A4, are pronounced the crease of plasma at simultaneous administration of aging.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Da Plasmaspiegelung of this hMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to Myopathy, including a rhubdomyolyse, the combined use of these drugs with ampprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to the stabilization of the mirror, since the plasma-centrate has increased from Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and tacrolim to be raised by Amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase is not used together with orally unbiased Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while in the same application of Agenerase with parcal Midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parcenteral Midazolam with other protector inhibitors to a possible increase in the plasma stream from Midazolam to the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with ampprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on Opiatentext symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the per se low casuousness of historical comparisons can currently no recommendation be given, such as the amprenavir- dose to adapt when Amusr is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">For simultaneous display of warfarin or other oralen antioagulants, along with Agenerase, an increased control of INR (International Standards for ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of toning or reinforcement of the physiological effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not predictable, hence also alternative methods of contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side-effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desireamine and Nortryptotilin) is recommended for simultaneous gift of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be applied after pregnancy only after careful withdrawal of the possible user's potential for the mother as compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>

<seg id="2003">The impossibility of aging was tested in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most associated with the Agenerase treatment connected side effects were slightly up to moderate, occurred early and led rarely to the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events is not clarified, whether it may be used in connection with the ingestion treatment or another at the same time to treat HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of disinfection.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the listed side-effects stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protector are not subject to patients 1200 mg Agenerase twice daily.</seg>

<seg id="2025">Based on genotype interpretations-based analyses genotype interpretations, can be applied for devaluation of the activity of ampprenavir / Ritonavir or Foscavir / Ritonavir in patients with protector-resistant insulation-resistant insulation.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11-algorithm für Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines Resistenz as the presence of the mutations of L10F / I, L33F, I54V, I54V, I54V, I54V, and L90M in conjunction with a stolen phenomenal resistance with Ritonavir and a decreased probability of a viroetic contact person (Resistenz).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data, and it is advised to always move the current interpretations systems to analyse the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">At phenomenal Resistenzental interpretations systems can be used in conjunction with the genetic data regarding the devaluation of the activity of ampprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protector-resistant insulation-resistant insulation.</seg>

<seg id="2035">The testament of the effectiveness of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study (600 mg twice daily) and nuclashes (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with reduced Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred (s = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in view to the period (AAUCMB) in the Viral last (EAUCMB) in the Plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-lower vibration of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the effectiveness of unauthorized Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies the Agenerase solution to take and capsules in dosing of 15 mg / kg every day, 20 mg / kg every day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosient ritonavir at the same time; the majority of people with PI previously untreated patients had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of which received with Agenerase NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of patients included in the study included a plasma-HIV virus &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output level.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Basics on this data should be considered during the treatment optimisation with PI previously expected children of the expected benefits of "unbridoostilt" Agenerase. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tomax) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule, and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for Cmax by 30% reduced when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), along with Amusr (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of ampprenanr with a meal leads to a 25% reduction in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of payers 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration at the steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake is influenced by the extent and rate of the resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution capacity is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and leaves to a large distribution capacity as well as an unavoidable penetration of ampprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in plasma, with the amount of unbiased amuss which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbiased amusr remains constant, fluctuating the percentage of free active components throughout the metabolic sequence in the steady State in the Steady State via the range of Cmax, ss up to Cmin.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, pharmaceuticals, which induce CYP3A4 invoke or inapprove or a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution if they are given simultaneously with Agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg every three times, leads to a similar daily routine exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>

<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirency in combination with ampprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins extenders would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these drugs are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virologic monitoring should be made, as an exact forecast of the effect of combination of ampprenavir and Ritonavir is difficult to detect on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, rifabutin together with Agenerase is to be administered at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum trainstations of calcium channels, such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipin, Nicodipin, Notdipin, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased by Amprenavir, thereby reducing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4-times daily) over 7 days of trial period, while the Endticasonpropionat intranasal decreased by approximately 86% (90% -connectivity interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">For simultaneous display of warfarin or other oralen antioagulants, along with Agenerase, an increased control of INR (International Standards for ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of toning or reinforcement of the physiological effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme is given to patients, the Aldurazyme, with regard to the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003, the European Commission divided the European Commission Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal-cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of Chinese Hamsters).</seg>

<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been established, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme, patients may develop infusion related reactions that are defined as any associated side-effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be widespread in machine, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should be carried out immediately at a reasonable level of clinical environment, in the revitational facilities for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase-3 study, that virtually all patients can form IgG antibodies against Laronidase usually within 3 months from treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since little experience in relation to the renewal of the treatment after a longer interruption, has to be careful due to the theoretically increased risk-reaction after interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistaminika and / or antipyretika), to minimize the potential occurrence of infectious reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of a light or medial infusion reaction, the treatment should be weighed with antihistaminika and parapamol / Ibuprofen and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate, where the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, heavy infusion-related reaction must be stopped until the symptoms are reported to the symptoms associated with antihistaminika and parapamol / Ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can result in infusion of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate, where the reaction has occurred, again.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistaminika and parapamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate, which occurred in reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied at the same time with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of an interference with the intraoperative inclusion of laronidase is used.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Tierexperimental studies do not leave direct or indirect impact on pregnancy, the embryo / fetal development, birth and postnatale development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">As no data on newborns, which were exponated compared to Laronidase above the mother's milk, is recommended, is recommended while treating with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side-effects in clinical trials were sorted mainly as infusion-related reactions, which were observed at 53% of patients in the phase-3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study of 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug operations related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3- study and its extension for a total of 45 patients aged five years, or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are usually listed in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper airways and lungs in the prehistory, there were heavy reactions to, including bronze, respiration and facial impeding (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unsolicited drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported in a Phas- 2-study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly hegemony form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">Intravenous once a week (recommended dose), 200 e / kg of intravenous once a week, 200 e / kg of intravenous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intravenous every two weeks.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase-3 study (or up to a premature retirement from the study) were found at 13 / 45 patients no by radioimmuno cipitation (RIP) Assay demonstrable antibodies, including 3 patients with which it had never been to servan.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with failing to lower antibodies referenced to a robust decline of the GAG Spiegels in the Harn, while patients with high antibodies would be able to establish a variable decrease of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase-3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal up to low NEUTRALIZLITE inhibitor effect on the enzymatic Laronidas- activity in vitro that seemed to impair clinical effectiveness and / or reducing GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies appeared not to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drugs actions, even if the appearance of undesirable pharmaceutical agents typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of another accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">In intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and of cells into the lymphomas, most likely about Mannose-6 phosphors receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were randomised, double-blind, placebokontrolulated phase-3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients have been recruited for the study carried out the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the mean phenotype and a patient dismissed the serious phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients have been enrolled, if they had a forciated expirator volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary outcomes for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute enclosures in the 6-minute- test test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label addying study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients were treated with Aldurazyme to the placebo group an improvement of the lung function and the ability to present in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In an open expansion study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as out of the following table emerges.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the predictive percentage FEV is not significant about this period clinically and the absolute lung volumina increased further proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">By the 26 patients with a hepatupol before treatment reached 22 (85%) by the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the GAG mirror in Harn (µg / mg Kreatinine) was established, which remained constant down to the study program.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding heterogeneous pathology between patients suffering from using a combined end point (an expected percentage point) across the 6-minute walk, movement of the shoulder-engeness AHI and chilies (58%), has generally been an improvement in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration at 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">It has been conducted a year-old open phase-2 study, which primarily examined the safety and pharmacetics of Aldurazyme at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with the heavy degradation form and 4 with the medium run form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirror in the Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) determined according to the Z-Score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle course shape (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle course shape, whereas the elderly patients could be limited only or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and break are (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapy, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as to the effects in this age group do not contain enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means the substance of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults, the chemotherapy agents received, which are a strong or excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are revealed 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi, in 24 hours after chemotherapy did not break (132 from 223), compared to 57% of the patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the excessive trigger for nausea and break are revealed 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi, in 24 hours after chemotherapy does not break (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">For comparison with Dolasetron, these values are 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission parted the European Commission of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the transport of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indices: for prevention of evacuity nausea and vomiting with severe emetoitive chemotherapy according to cancer treatment and the prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderate inetooth-chemotherapy according to a cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi on the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding any Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon tank, patients should be monitored using an amnesty obstipation or signs of a submarine Ileus after the injecting machine.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable at the simultaneous gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt- interval is extended or bowed to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Besides in connection with another chemotherapy agents, aloxi is supposed to be used neither to prevent chemotherapy nor to treat nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials inhibiting Palonosetron the intoxiciled activity of the five studied chemical otherapeutics not (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, Cytarabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial, there were no significant pharmacogenic interaction between a unique intravenous dosage and a steady-static vascular metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one on a population based pharmacogenic analysis was shown that the simultaneous running of CYP2D6 Indicine (Dexamearon, Fluoxetine, semi-oxetine, koxetine, koxetine, koxetine and Terbinafin) has not had a significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences of the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies, therefore, should not be applied, therefore, should be considered Palonosetron for pregnant, unless it is necessary from the treated doctor than necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common in a dose of 250 mcg to observing side-side effects (a total of 633 patients), who were at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of oversensitivity and reactions of administration (browning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage showed themselves similar cases of unwanted events such as in the other dosing-groups; there were no dose of a dose of action.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies conducted because of the great distribution volumens is a dialysis however presumably no effective therapy in Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised doubledstudies, a total of 1,132 patients, which received a moderate inetogenic chemotherapy with &lt; 500 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mcg or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron (half-day 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7.2 hours), which was given in day 1 without Dexamethasone intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind, total of 667 patients, which received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with oral 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and dacarmence, as well as 250 or 750 microgram of Palonosetron, which were given 32 mg Ondansetron that were given on day 1 of the intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-etooth-chemotherapy and the study with severe emetogenic chemotherapy is summarised in the following tables (sheets).</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indications of chemotherapy induced exercise and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the QTc Intervalls with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the invented failure, Palonosetron has the ability to block the channels involved at the ventricular DE- and repolarization involved and the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy Probanden study was the assessment of the ECG's effects of i.V. adosetron in single doses of 0,25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Summary After intravenous Gabe follows the initial decrease of the plasma-centralised, a slow elimination from the body with an average terminous half-time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma-zentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration time-curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the whole tin-range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg by healthy and cancer victims dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous Gabe by Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, consisting of 11 high-temperature oxidants were measured between day 1 and day 5% increase in the Palonosetron-Plassercentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacological simulations from pharmaceuticals, that resulted in even daily intravenous Gabe in 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with which after non-recurring intravenous administration, however, the Cmax after the addition of 0,75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on Metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a minor extent that Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an immutable substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolt projection at healthy, the total-clearance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renale Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe living-functioning the terminale Eliminationism and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is therefore non-justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions, which are considered adequate over the maximum humanic exposure, which suggests a low relevance for the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 For preclinical trials, references that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations, which can be involved in the ventricular DE- and repolarization and can prolong the shareholders of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose said in about the 30fold of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of living, endocrine, pancreatic, pancreatic spinal cord) and skin-umors with rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doses and since aloxi is intended for humans to be unique use, the relevance of these results are evaluated for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Humanarztints (CHMP) adopted a negative credit, where the approval of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injecting solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same practice, which is already approved in the EU (also called "Reference intake)."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-standing) hepatitis C (one through viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation the liver tissue indicates that the values of the liver-enzymms Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) increases in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) has been initiated that this applies to the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon put data before the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and effectiveness at Hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of alpheon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference practices in 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured, as many patients after 12 of total 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the drug mentioned (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">"" "" "" "moreover, concerns were expressed concerns that the data on the stability of the drug and the market must not be sufficient." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C who spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with aleon, the disease vaccinated with more patients than at the reference point; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test carried out in the study by examining the question, to what extent the drug is an immune response (that is, the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied for the treatment of Impetigo (one with crust education) and small ininfected Lazarus (Riss- or counter-unden), deed and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not intended to treat infections, which were detectable or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo does not affect this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine, but in patients under the age of 18, patients may not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should once again examine the patient and consider alternate treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial rebooms (the parts of the bacterial infections in which proteins are produced) and thus inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indikator of the effectiveness was filmed in all five studies of the patients whose infection was completed after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Hauts, Altargo and Cefali expressed similar points: if the results of both studies were brought together at home-scale, talked about 90% of the patients of both groups in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, that Altargo has been observed in the treatment of Abszessen (less filled in body tissues) or infections, which were detectable or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation on the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Humanarztants (CHMP) launched to conclude that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections in relation to the risks: • Impetigo, • infied little launderation, deed or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007 the European Commission rushed to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients in which two or three days are no improvement, should once again be examined and considered an alternative therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of awareness or serious local irritation by the use of Retapamulin salbe the treatment is broken, the ointment was carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary wound, the effectiveness of reaprulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2-day treatment no improvement or a deterioration of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma richness, which have been reached in people after topical application on bediced skin or infected superficial wounds, is a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3. after simultaneous display of 2-times daily 200 mg Ketoconazole the mean saaprulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin salbe on bediced skin from healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low-systemic exposure for topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not required to be required, if topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproducible toxicity after oral ingestion and are insufficient with regards to a statement on the birth and the federations / postnatale development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indices and the use of retapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding continues to be terminated or completed with Altargo, is between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies at 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo, the most common reported field of confusion at the date of administration, which looked at about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effectiveness of retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Clitopilus passagerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The drug mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective Hemation of the bacterial proteinosis by interaction at a specific bond of the 50 sub-unit of the bacterial rebosom, which differs from the Binding of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the bond of ribosomales protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-Binding center and the PeptidyltransferaseCenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By Binding to this Binding Pleuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, blocking partially P-bonds - interactions and prevent normal education active 50-Bosnian units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should on the basis of the local prevalence of the resistance, the use of retapamulin, at least some infecting forms may appear, a consultation by experts should be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates hypersensitive or resistant to methicillin were.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of a non-speaking on treatment at S.aureus the presence of tribes should be considered with additional Virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin salbe was given daily under Occlusion on intact and on the mild skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), which received 1% Retapamulin salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary dental wounds, individual plasma was won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The acceptance rate was carried out in days 3 or 4 during adult patients before implantation and in the children between 0-12 hours according to the previous application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in people after topical use of 1% Salbe on 200 cm ² (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP imitation.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative Metabolism of Retapamulin in human Lebermikrosomas became primary thanks to CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children between one and 15 years that are not immeasurably bound up against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within one out of two doses of existing vaccines, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix should only be used when the immunisation is a low risk of a hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the existing vaccines can be led to an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is designed against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis-A- or -B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have an effect by bringing the immune system (the natural resistance of the body), as it can prevent against an illness.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the licensed vaccine Twinrix adults and since 1997 approved for Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect the same disease, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administering existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix includes identical ingredients, some of the data collected the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indikator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional trial with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led at between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection on the development of antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine) are headaches, apetitemgel, pain on the injecting site, redness, matness (tiredness) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix is allowed to react hypersensitive (allergic) on the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic) to not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission rushed to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. for the marketing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for gratization with Ambirix is made of two vaccines, with the first dose of the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, it can vaccinated with the corresponding monovals vaccines or with a combative vaccinated vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-HCV anti-HCV anti-HCV antigen (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A-virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovals vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet completely assured, if immunizable persons, who have addressed on a hepatitis C, a refresher vaccination as protection, as it is also protected with no longer referable antibodies to be protected by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 How in all injections should be available to the rare cases of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate ways of medical treatment and monitoring is always available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standardization systemema is recommended with the Combine motors, the 360 ELISA units and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In Hämodialysepatienten and persons with disorders of the immune system, under circumstances no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies is achieved, so in these cases the gift of further vaccination can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to an suboptimal imaging result, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In these cases in Thrombozytopenie or blood clots, Ambirix cannot be incomparably subcutaneous in these cases for intramuscular circulation to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix during the second life year in the form of a separate injector, Tetanus-, azellular poliomyelit- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combinated mascot mumps-vaccine administered was the immune response to all antigens is sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective needs to be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was passed through 3 vaccination of this formulation in adults, was the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, sailors, gastroenterology, headaches and fever comparable to the frequency associated with the earlier Thiomersal- and preservative vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2751">2029 vaccines have been administered by 2029 vaccines at the age of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses of combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and sailor on a calculation basis per vaccine dose ambirix but not based on a computation of per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% with the probanden after the gift of a dose of the 3-doses of combinant.</seg>

<seg id="2756">The frequency of maternity was however a proband comparable to (that is, compared to the total vaccinations at 39,6% of the subjects that got Ambirix compared to 36.2% with the probands that received the 3-cans of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency distinctive pain and inactivity was low and comparable that was observed after administration of the combined combined with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study with 1- to 11-year vaccine was the appearance of local reactions and general actions in the AmbirixGroup, comparable with the 3-doses combination with 360 ELISA units and more 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix was a common appearance of pain (at the injecting site) per dose, not per proxy.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported via severe side-effects during the 2-doses-diagrams with the drop-doses of 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis C-A surface antigen, was statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were carried out at vacclingen at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the Serenaversionrates for anti-HAV 99,1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for the month 6 say dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2764">For the 289 persons whose immune imbalance was more valuable, the seroprotary rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6, according to the gift of the 3-Dosenant-care is significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response that were achieved in a clinical trial phase at 1- to 11-year-old one month after termination of the full vaccination (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations were given either a 2-pole vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units formal inactive hepatitis A-virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of gratization between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be proven at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix in 0-6-month vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The observed in this study observed Immunity against both antigens was comparable to the vaccination of 3 doses with a combination of combination, consisting of 360 ELISA units with a combined hepatite hepatite hepatitis B-surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- to including 15-year-old, there could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies 24 months after immunisation in 0-6- months-vaccination is comparable to that in 0-12-month vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2785">If possible risk of an infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B-surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with decreased content to effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine before ending the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambirix should be vaccinated in separate places and as various limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix pregnant or nursing women are not administered unless it is urgent that they vaccinated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been announced since issuing the first approval for the marketing agreement, the CHMP opinion that the benefits of risk-risk for Ambirix will remain positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix is only limited to a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data is limited to this medicine due to the low patient position.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonites can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete end-fat defect or with hyperclientele Encephaly (brain damage as a result of high ammonackonzentrations) in the history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonite is - split into several single doses to meals - swallowed under food mixed or over a Gastroenteral tavern (through the stomach cover in the stomach of leading tube) or a nasal onde (through the nose in the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammonite did not compare with other treatment or with placebo (a spotlight signal, that is to be compared without a drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonites can also lead to loss of loss, irritability, headache, anxiety, irritation, headache, redness, rash, rash, rash, rash, rash, rash, rash, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Humanarztants (CHMP) launched at the conclusion that Ammonaps in patients with disorders of the uretic cycle to high ammonium values effectively prevents.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonites was approved under "exceptional circumstances, since due to the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed to all patients with which the entire Enzymmangel has already manifested itself in the new year old (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with belated form (incomplete endometric defect, which is manifested after the first life of life), then there is a indication for use when in Anamnese is a hyperardent encephaly.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with gorging disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein-tolerance and growth and development of the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with heron-growing and adult.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer at an early manifying lack of carbyl phosphate synthetic or ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of Citrulline or Arginine is necessary in a dosage of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a argininosappuccase lack must be arginine in a dosage of 0,4 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets must not be administered with loopia, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulzera if the tablets are not immediately getting into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum dosis.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore insuffice with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and oil-formation conditions, only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolic and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate about the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these findings in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">For subcutaneous types of phenylacetate to young rats in high Dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and a stressed loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed irritation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerves in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether Phenylacetate is eliminated by humans into the mother's milk, and this reason is the use of AMMONAPS during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients had at least an undesirable event (AE) and at 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not connected to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anoretical patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktataziebox, Panzytopenie, peripherals neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overturn appeared in a 5 month old toddler with an accidosis of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed with an intravenous administration of doses to 400 mg / kg / day a dosislimiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic disease connecting with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is eliminated by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Pushometric is seen as phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with Urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative sponsor for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the uretic cycle can be assumed that for each grammes, sodium phenylbutyrate between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is placed at an early stage and the treatment immediately started to improve the prospects of survival and the clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">Prognosis of the early-manifested form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms experienced in the newborn age was almost always infatist, and the disease resulted in treatment with peroneonedialysis and essential amino acids, or with their embroidery-free analogue within the first year of death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By Hämodialyse, the exploitation of alternate paths of nitrogen calcium (sodium polyphenyl acetate), proteinment reduced and any substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rates of new borrowful at postpartal (but within the first life of life) diagnosed in 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rates were 100%, but even in these patients there was time with many too spiritual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with belated form of the disease (including feminine patients with the heterozygotes form of the Ornithintranscarbamylase-lack), which were treated by a hyperammonium arctic leukaat and a proteinment reduced diet, the overrate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients may occur further deterioration of neurological states.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is composed in liver and Niere enzymatic with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and of its Metabolites in plasma and Urin were determined in sodium healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the uretic cycle, the hermoist rhosis after item, as well as repetitive gifts of oralen doses from up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also investigated with cancer victims of the intravenous genes of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after ingesting measurable plasma is determined by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary medicines or hemrobinopathies, after different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) the next morning after night-visual fasting no phenylacetate was in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">At three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three soldoses), the medium-sized phenylacetate condensities in plasma on the third day five times higher than after the first gaps.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugiated product Phenylacetylglutamine about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrate had no clocate effects (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules is taken either by oral (infants and children, which can still not swallow the tablets, or patients with loydisrupeds) or via a pale stical stine.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborn child, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with heron-growing and adult.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serumprotone in plasma should be held within the normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer at an early manifying lack of carbyl phosphate synthetic or ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of Citrulline or Arginine is necessary in a dosage of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum dosis.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rapins were subjected to phenylacetate (active metabolit by phenylbutyrat), there came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain rinks.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anoretical patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktataziebox, Panzytopenie, peripherals neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Pushometric is seen as phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with Urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore ideal as an alternative to excreting the excretion of bubbles</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the uretic cycle can be assumed that for each grammes, sodium phenylbutyrate between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients may occur further deterioration of neurological states.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform were found 15 minutes after taking measurable pluseces of phenylbutyrat.</seg>

<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS is dissolved before use also in water (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are lacking certain live-enzymes, so that they accumulate the intake of proteins in the body after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are going to be carried out in the laboratory testing, you need to notify the doctor that you take AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with "acute Koronarsyndromen" (ACS, decreased blood sugar in the heart), for example with instile Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardinfos (heart attack) without "ST- Hebung" (an anomal measuring value in electrocardiogram or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Will Angiox applied to prevent clots in patients who undergo a PCI Express, a higher dosage is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with Angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow and enhance the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximating 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of detox injectors, or in connection with a glycored-IIb / IIIA inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent clots) with conventional combination treatment with heparin (another antioagulans) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During PCI the patient was often a stent (a short tube stays, which remains in the arterie in order to prevent a closure), and they received additionally other medicines to prevent clots, such as waste torximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS there Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, coronary accidents or Revascularization) after 30 days and a year as effective as traditional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who has subjected to an PCI, Angiox was just as effective as Heparin, except for heavy blood vessels, with which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox cannot be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other pastudine or one of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are observed during treatment carefully in terms of symptoms and signs of blood circulation, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another antioagulan (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if there occur in PCI-patients under Bivalirudin most bleeding on arterial punctuation cases (PCI) undergo, during the treatment in principle everywhere bleeding occur.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients, the warfarin are taken and treated with bivalirudin, should consider a monitoring of the INR value (International Standards for ratio) to ensure that the value after derivation of treatment with bivalirudin should be achieved before the treatment existing level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the drug mechanism of anti-agulants (Heparin, warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombozytenaggregationshemmer) it can be assumed that these ingredients increase the blood flow.</seg>

<seg id="2913">Both in the bevalirudin group as well as in hepatine treated comparisons came to women and patients over 65 years more often than undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy clots were defined after the ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy clots as described in the foots of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy clots occurred under Bivalirudin alone significantly less often than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitor and BivaliDrugs plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">A ACUITY heavy hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intrakranielle, intraoidal hemorisation, or blood pressure required by the electrocoating, reduction of the hemogglobetrotels of AM803 g / dl with known blood point, reoperation due to hemortion, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>

<seg id="2919">Both in the bevalirudin group as well as with heparin actually treated comparisons came to women and patients over 65 years more often than undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy clots occurred under Bivalirudin significantly less frequent than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects that are listed above were reported after a comprehensive use in the practice and are summarised by system organings in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately extracted and the patient will be widespread in terms of signs of blood circulation.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bevalirudin, a direct and specific throtary inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre as well as to the Anionenactment region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombine is bound in the liquid phase or to the tinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of bivalirudin at Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin turn on the bond of bivalirudin-arg3-Pro4, thus creating the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, by Bivalirudin with serum of patients where it was in the past to hepatic induced Thrombozytopenie / heparininduced Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) was to induce no Thromatic resin reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy Probanden and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dose-dependent anticoagulent effect, which is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI has been conducted in patients with an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin and the infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1,75mg / kg / h will be increased.</seg>

<seg id="2940">The pharmacological properties of bivalirudin were evaluated by patients who underwent a percutaneous corridor (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as Peptid has a catabolism in its amino acid orabites with subsequent redistributing the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolit that result from the split of the arg3-Pro4-bond of the N-terminale sequence through Thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin or any other components, or in patients who are already suffering from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicinal products, which can affect the gluing seal.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004, the European Commission rushed to the company Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH for approval of the marketing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
