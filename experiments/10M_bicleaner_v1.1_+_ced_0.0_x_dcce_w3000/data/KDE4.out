the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; load settings Add @-@ ons .... Open the map tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard modules included in the package ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules on your system are , if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras ab@@ cr@@ ashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available , delete .
the module rec@@ kl@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under tools An@@ visions filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M Bau@@ man@@ tle in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; use the extras DO@@ M tree display ... and therefore open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as a pres@@ et , the display begins with the root element of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all the other knot@@ s are under@@ elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the distinctive feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; it consists of portra@@ y folders with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is represented by a rectang@@ le , whose surface must be proportional to its size . this size does have to possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of a object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; this reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized if they are far down in the folder of folder . hence , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; commands may be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap image represents a rectang@@ le , which represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simplify navigation , the right @-@ based navigation possess reasonable color and plug @-@ ins .
the colour of a rectang@@ le , which is swit@@ ched on color mode , can be either deep for the light detection of the scre@@ ams , or representation of a different file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectang@@ le can be lab@@ elled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for any property you can specify , only when enough space to be displayed , or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ate or@@ bit@@ ing should be used ( whereby the surface errors occur through restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rectang@@ le .
for Dar@@ ing algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the general rule is to be respected . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this objective is not always respected . there will be frames available to represent the s@@ laughter of the entries , and this frame will not be available to the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries no longer available when the rectang@@ le is square .
as a division of the area of an entry for sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries is left , the implementation remains left to it . here , it is necessary for the locking and avoid@@ ance of space wr@@ apped by setting always beneficial the areas so that the fields are possible . the best methods of this are rows , columns , or record .
you can specify the minimal set area for an entry over the menu item view on area . instead , a R@@ aut@@ en@@ pattern is marked in the surface of the super@@ ordin@@ ate entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an or@@ derly entry .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for the use KC@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .

improved database with much more met@@ adata , like ep@@ eg ; via the camera or the lens , which can be looked for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvements .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; tries to use the mil@@ let of problems or suggestions for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry or wishes .... This opens a dialog with a sub@@ ordin@@ ate system . all required information S@@ ind is listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ sts : is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ sts ; then we would like to answer any questions addressed to other users of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; however , we will soon answer questions of other users . however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list , this language should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the di@@ gi@@ a ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; to learn .
the best start to get involved in &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; the registration in the developer @-@ mail list . guidance to log in in the developer &apos;s mailing list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; .
when you start &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; for the first time you &apos;ll be asked where you can specify your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply tick the name button or click the folder symbol folder to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data decre@@ ases will be saved . this path remains the same for all cap@@ tions .
later you can add as many folder as you like . &amp; di@@ gi@@ got ; you will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek in addition to the Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you have already specified a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder containing images , as a basic folder . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder you get a progress show like this :
&amp; di@@ gi@@ allo : dur@@ ations re@@ cur@@ si@@ v the libr@@ arian path@@ way in all its depth . you cannot do any sub @-@ folders , unless it came i@@ est in hiding directory . this allows you to get an extra@@ ordin@@ ated folder &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; settle a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as basic folder , you &apos;ll notice that the albums in my Al@@ ben@@ list won &apos;t take pictures as symbols . you can change the by using a favorite photo from the album and then use this on the folder symbol . more details click here in the section albums .
once you have con@@ figured the basic folder you can set in &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; your digital camera came up . after that , you should learn how to use my albums and My key@@ word to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ ei@@ vat@@ ure : if you &apos;re using the Roh@@ atic mode of your camera , it may also handle . the support is based on the Libyan library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help cloud suppor@@ tive .

an easy to use camera camera is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; -@@ albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and any card reader , which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transmission . the camera can also be realized as USB @-@ mass storage device . the camera can also be realized through the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the terminal port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which is a steadily increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Phot@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol created by the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it allows the transfer of pictures from digital cameras to b@@ ills and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the ser@@ iel@@ le interface for their communication with the computer . as photos in general large files are now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; supports this cameras and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Phot@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to be read by di@@ gi@@ val reli@@ ably . if the ex@@ if support is not available by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 cam@@ er@@ ings . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be able to admit anything or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things that came to &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules : the KDE image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to developing a common modular structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; to develop K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the settings for the IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it &apos;s much simpler , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; by writing a little modular um to supplement a function as the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; to perform itself .
to simplify the window , you can either move the side@@ ways with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + switching + F .
to drag and drop images anywhere : you can drop a picture in another part of the tree , using the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only restriction is that one image does not reveal in keywords , file list or ad@@ diction .
- a file selection allows you to lift the common boxes : JPEG , PNG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the Text@@ filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , the fil@@ tering is displayed on the fil@@ ename only if this are the tool@@ bar also displayed . which fields are displayed , you can configure in the dialog of the file settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; introduces a organized view on your photograph . these albums can be managed by the folders containing the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or by date on which the album was first created , sorted . the date can be changed in the features of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan a screens@@ hot to add an album directly to an album . select this album pic@@ kl@@ as screens@@ hot .
to copy a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with your mouse on the target album and drop it . in the then displayed menu you will have to move on whether or copy the image by moving or cop@@ ying . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the Alb@@ um@@ properties allow you to add information about this collection . to access the album properties , you must click with the right mouse button on the album and select in the context menu Alb@@ um@@ Properties .
Alb@@ um@@ - Collec@@ tions : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can choose from your photos by selecting the tool@@ bar , or view albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections .
das Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums , sort by date sort .
the buttons El@@ ders , average , new : this set the date on the one of the oldest , of the latest image or that of the passage of the album . in addition , the average of images emerged from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first joined an album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae , the first image is chosen as a symbol of the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ vest@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo of the album is not representative and you might want to select a different photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau . additionally you can drag the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album may be only available in a collection and collections cannot be wast@@ ed .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; supports the input of key@@ ed for individual photos in the area of the key@@ word on the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can naturally use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window provides you the main view of your photos . if you choose an album , all images are displayed in the photo window . each photo will display in a preview , you can adjust the size of this pre @-@ look with the two micro@@ phones in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album the first time you will soon wait , while the pre @-@ piece pictures will be generated . this allows you to avoid in which you can create yourself in the menu extras All the samples .
information on any picture will display below the accompanying preview . what information this is , you can change about settings di@@ gi@@ sts ; setup on here the albums page and adjust the area preferences to your wishes .
the pre@@ views have help , the present@@ ed. if you let the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor a moment about a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screens@@ hot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such an assistant .
photos are all , what happened at &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; proceeds . albums and tags allow you to organise your pictures as it fits you . you can reach all of the functions associated with &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; you can easily reach the context menu of th@@ umb@@ nails or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between the viewing of images , a slideshow or the editing of images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button . image editing you can see a guide how to edit your photos . by picture editing you can view your photos and change it .
it may happen that &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button , and how you adapt it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image processing programs can come to problems with those in the image contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; provides two options for fil@@ ming . the sim@@ pl@@ est is to right click on the th@@ umb@@ nails and select from the menu . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ ename of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the Pre@@ view and F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you maintain the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; del@@ eting it becomes del@@ ayed in the tr@@ ash cans of &amp; k@@ de ; S@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Ent@@ f If you prefer to del@@ eting this , you can use this by using Shi@@ ft ; Ent@@ f .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organis@@ es your photos by the data . &amp; di@@ gi@@ got ; used for this either the EX@@ IF @-@ Date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
when you choose a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can choose days or weeks in the data sheet below in the dates view , so that you can only be shown the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords will provide a flexible and powerful opportunity to organize and catalogue your photos . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be assigned to a photo by choosing this password or search once again .
when a key@@ word is selected , all the photos , which were marked with this key@@ word , appear .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also organize your tags log@@ ically . you can also hold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My sam@@ e.@@ t@@ li@@ ste@@ eper , so you can find the keywords you are looking for , easily find .
the tags will be stored in a database for quick access and secure key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JPEG , saved . so you can also use your tags in other programs . also , the keywords will be imported in the loss of the database as soon as &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the pictures noticed .
you can add new tags by right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; or on an existing key@@ word , after you have a new key@@ word , after you click on an existing key@@ word , this is the fore@@ word of this password .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word , right click and deleted . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a password by moving it to the desired position in the tree and then insert a menu that gives you the opportunity to post@@ p@@ one the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be once in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and select in the context menu . you can change the name of the password and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ w@@ quot ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As the album preview . in addition , you can draw the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to get rid of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; s functionality with sam@@ pling , you first need to pick out your photos with key@@ word , you can first drag your photos into the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ ed quot ; drag and drop it down . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the look of the pictures and select from the context menu key@@ word .
you can insert a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be shown as soon as you choose one of the keywords to deny it . in this way you can choose a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have a photo with key@@ ed , this is displayed under the preview of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a tim@@ ental barrier to the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be postpon@@ ed by this hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ing . to select a time@@ frame , which indicates the time unit . therefore all related images are shown in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
include all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dates and in the future even more .
Neb@@ aul@@ box is a small lamp the green when the search matches . if you click here , the Fil@@ tering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp is red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with tel@@ esc@@ ope . if you open this , you can store a simple search box as described above . you can store this search here but as a live search that has always fil@@ tered you as a search crit@@ erion . after you save the fil@@ t@@ d he filter in the list .
if you are happy with your choice , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the text box can be used in the window of your search list . if you want to change your choice after searching again , you only need to select the appropriate item from the view to select a search list and select an option in its context menu option .

if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search .
the Advanced search provides an enhanced search form with many search param@@ es@@ ders available , with which you can search in specific fields of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; s database can be looking for .
the list of the search rules will be used to set the options added for a search query in the Alb@@ anian Datab@@ ase . an option can delete or delete it . each option can be added with others about the logical operations . each option can be added with others about the logical operations . this allows you to link to the Type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ GH@@ T@@ quot ;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique that compar@@ es hair @-@ algorith@@ m . this allows to compare images by compar@@ ing these signat@@ ures . the less the difference between two signat@@ ures , the more correspond to them . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture in order to find a similar one . by means of a sw@@ elling , the result selection can be increased or smaller . if you slide a picture from somewhere on the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then you will open up and you can drop it there .
Sk@@ etch : open @-@ color @-@ sk@@ etch : record a fast sk@@ etch and di@@ gi@@ fted ; find the right pictures . also here can be set a sw@@ elling .
this rider represents an intuitive dealer @-@ tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature . you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse kno@@ b to pull a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this naturally puts ahead of your pictures Geo @-@ data included .

&amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; introduces a be@@ acon in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image data formats , as well as raw files .
select one or more images from any view on the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em lumin@@ ous add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous menu and its window opened . if you &apos;re back in &amp; di@@ gi@@ stic ; the window you are able to open the lumin@@ ous with L extras
from the preview , you can compare the pictures that you want to compare inside the left or right area of the window . if you preview ori@@ ze out of the tool@@ bar and can perform at one of the pictures , then they will also be executed with the other image . so you can compare the same range of both images .
another mode is better suited to select quickly from a picture series . if you can easily navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the left mouse button is automatically displayed in the fields of reference . the right adjacent picture is displayed in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal ext@@ ingu@@ actions can also work directly from the lumin@@ ous as the F@@ 4 file ....
all pic@@ ality information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both pre @-@ viewing images in the lumin@@ ous . this makes it possible for example to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swing feature that you can detect on the s@@ crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the picture , you need to click these instructions and the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode Pre@@ view then both images show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the Zoom @-@ regul@@ ator among the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to go into the image and additionally zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you &apos;re in the mode Pre@@ view .

I d@@ are to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find out more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; . the approach to store the met@@ adata both in a database and in the images files guarantees very fast search and a secure archi@@ ving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you can do and know before you own anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether to store other access to your photos , whether you want to save them on a reser@@ ving drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday Typ@@ es can be found quickly through your location . if you have enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements like e.g. version of photos , archi@@ ving , constant intake of images on different topics and a large number of anything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not be able to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the stack @-@ processing simpler . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend the met@@ adata to store met@@ adata in the setup page of the met@@ adata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently select the met@@ adata of the database into the files by selecting on the corresponding item on the item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to help them select a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes , these are of course the most important ones .
now , the real work begins , as you can now select each photo keywords , plug @-@ ups and valu@@ ation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attri@@ bute and then set the value then . you start the best with the review or position . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos .
let us now take a key@@ word , key@@ word as you continue with other programs often called hot or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alog@@ zed images from another source with built @-@ in sam@@ pling , then com@@ prise &amp; di@@ gi@@ w ; automatically insert the tree for you b@@ w the pictures in the right place . the sort of the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can be done easily by moving a sub@@ tree on another . the changed keywords will be trac@@ ed by &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; updated during it the sub@@ trees pursued .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata re@@ gro@@ ve . this is a very cru@@ de representation since each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and cal@@ ender records are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords , the next section relates to retri@@ eves or comments , the third important tool to catalogue your Met@@ adata .
you just want to let me see most of your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream of associations , memories , the historical time @-@ span is again present , you possibly can even hear the silence . so your perception of this panor@@ amas has changed completely .
for others who regard your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer to Him over the motive which you moves has to understand what you understand .
it is ok if an image is not perfect , if it &apos;s the strength only work with a circum@@ stance for itself alone .
with &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; you can save as a text editor at an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) than export . you can even export it for a choice of pictures at the same time . KDE can even tell you a rectang@@ le @-@ spell check , and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system . you have to tell the story so for opening a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was she was not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the ways to take advantage of taking advantage are already countless and are repe@@ ating in the future , you can also repeat your travel virtually through pictures with geographical references . this then also can export the photos on the recording . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps @-@ viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and describe the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; for information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization has been made . after which this value has been saved , it should no longer be changed . this field does not support commun@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el ( syn@@ onym for the editor ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work@@ book of the photographer . examples of this may be as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author , it must be filled out just as well .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who there is the photo . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer can be listed here , you can submit the image to others . if the image is a bearing picture , then here the group / agency offers the picture here .
it is important to fill the author and copyright infrin@@ gement , though they have no protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has no protection against abuse at work . anyone who has a little bit more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators . for individuals , this is only important for the majority of your photos of low interest . for professionals and holding professionals , this protection is very important to that .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; in the near future this module will provide such a module for stack processing .

of course , we are not talking about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional pap@@ er@@ photos or negative . in this section , it is about problems with the so called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data stream company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to be treated more easily than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in the archive , which are more difficult to get more and more expensive . there are offers above gold plated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece could claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe that is in your discretion .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you are using good dis@@ ks and good recording units . the best DVD aud@@ itions are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable . it therefore is about choosing the right .
CDs and DVDs are highly sus@@ cep@@ tible to error , even if you were just writing them . 75 % of the data are effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they need by chemical aging , Ultra@@ violet light , scr@@ at@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes mir@@ acles in CDs and DVDs . however , it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the def@@ ective data of def@@ ective disk@@ ettes , hard drives , Flash media , USB @-@ drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to win the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six@@ teen the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good entrance to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . then please read the media with a description , date &amp; author characters and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and especially animals protected site . do not forget the data to read the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read through this media .
disk manufacturers maintain your statistics for themselves . your production facilities include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides for this topic a large field study about the fault mechanics of hard drives : dis@@ inf@@ alli@@ zation
in brief : leave on the longest when you are running in the temper@@ ament of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . electronic parts of the Cont@@ roll@@ ers are the most common error type , SM@@ ART cannot notice these errors . some of SM@@ ART errors are reported immediately ahead . these are particularly les@@ ho@@ ists and re@@ moves . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete turn@@ key due to surplus @-@ tension . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electricity out before you secured the files , but these losses usually leave without major problems .
while most electrical devices does not make a difference , these can take heavy damage during devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed power processors , complete data loss , hardware design , hardware components and other defects . thus , you take advantage of yourself from un@@ avoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against rap@@ tops is an over@@ thr@@ illing protection . this is a device that part of energy @-@ storage absor@@ bs and rest . it is usually available in the form of a socket . however , remember that not every plug @-@ bill also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an extra @-@ voltage detection , then you should be careful that he offers the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against light@@ ning bolt and therefore protect the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ load of each cable is used to your computer , you should be careful that also all periods are connected to your computer . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms as well . some manufacturers make Over@@ voltage support that also contain a telephone connection for your mo@@ dem . others offer connectivity for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable thr@@ illing protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks , which is very small and you also included the protection for the mo@@ dem . this makes you ideal for travel .
while an over@@ thr@@ illing protection system will protect your system from smaller variations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete case . even a loss of few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free electricity supply .
apart from the protection from surplus @-@ voltage these devices may provide automatically battery @-@ energy efficiency if an electricity loss occurs . some models allow them to even further work until the current run . if you purchase a US@@ V , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements like an over@@ thr@@ illing protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your b@@ illing system is exposed and and compare its security with electricity disorders associated with costs for avoiding this . a high quality over@@ thr@@ illing protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you think about how well your machine is protected . at the end you should always remember all the cable before you drive to the holidays .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can share it as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are at home compared to the hard drives , however , very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you will need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . therefore , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services available on photos and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ a year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of data backup , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically rep@@ lic@@ ed thanks to the TCP @-@ protocol and with the large companies is stored in the supply of a backup and a shared memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safe .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain on the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs pose at least the database integrity and system safely .
the worst thing is that you no one says if such a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it &apos;s pretty distur@@ bing that there should be no protection to one day . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission capacity as they generate inter@@ mut@@ ations within the data currents . in normal fil@@ esystem these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already , 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be able to deal with turn@@ tables on low level and is scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one for the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched a dedicated file system with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanism which are z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % for the job systems . not@@ ebooks are the percentage of the theft of 50 % .
data loss owing to viruses is less common than most of the most people think . it results in a lower damage than theft or re@@ install@@ ations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been no longer sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to call the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ ately status will be avoided . if a file was not completely stored before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human errors are the root causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 light@@ ning settings of fundamental physical limits . meant that while the technology is developing further there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and cat@@ er@@ als for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteri@@ or@@ ated for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or bigger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , you do not charge any other data loss today . so , if you do not want your data to be affected by any data loss . so , your data is often associated according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make daily your backup on an external SATA disk . if , then one day , a light@@ ning strike , you were lucky when the drive is not connected in the moment .
a disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot . forget flying un@@ gl@@ ücke : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house .
therefore , Des@@ aster prevention is always a non @-@ storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a frequent reason for a loss of data while safeguarding the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ating assurance : a backup of the files changed since the last complete product . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : the complete assurance and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original state at any time . this backup comes from a ver@@ sion@@ ing system , the next one with the exception that it is only off , and not continuing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transm@@ issions . this happens comp@@ ressed and if you would like to increase security via ssh .
ensure important images directly after watching them on your computer to DVD or other op@@ t@@ arian medium .
this procedure lets you have enough time to detect losses and restore . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of work files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
themes : met@@ adata , in image file stored IP@@ TC information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , Vis@@ itors , ... , use of the internet .
with that valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is about time @-@ span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future because of your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , you must look at everything today with caution and rate new during the time . unfortunately , there is no other option to be fully compatible as the current system back@@ wards . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easily it is to assess the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that &apos;s important to read your pictures , then save it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is fairly simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should review your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually always growing .
let &apos;s suppose that you plan the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record .
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record was detected by the system , but do not attach them .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and re@@ plac@@ fs &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad c@@ 1 # change the size of alpha if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not have any software you can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier by year to year .
GI@@ F is a propri@@ etary , pat@@ ented format dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
PNG , as an open source standard the GI@@ F should replace it . however , X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color @-@ channel and full transparency . PNG , gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ site data can store for improved color information , but not as many as TI@@ FF , but not as many as TI@@ FF , and this format we would like to recommend you to the stor@@ ing of your images .
TI@@ FF was widely used as picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ comp@@ ressed form or in a container with a rever@@ sible comp@@ ression sal@@ g@@ .@@ mus ( de@@ late ) . a problem is however that this format was adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The digital neg@@ atives file format is a licensed free and open blan@@ kets that developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed because of the need to use the camera formulation . DN@@ G is already available at the TI@@ FF / EP format and we hope to use the co @-@ competitors Canon and Nikon it to some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has implemented its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF ; it is a mark@@ er technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file even if file information is saved with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in the Roh@@ format , archi@@ ving . X@@ MP fits this since the met@@ adata file will come separately from the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as container and put it together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation that supports a comprehensive range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I includes working on architecture and mod@@ elling , discussions and collabor@@ ative work in the D@@ CM@@ I Communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tened efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the dealer or the scanner , as long as the images on the camera edi@@ um are you can use this as temporary backup .
convert files into DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fin@@ ite processing you can use external programs . if you want to use the pictures again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut under circumstances from the other programs .
protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in Web@@ gal@@ erien , coding you in MPEG , use in contact leaves , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; you will find in the section of some photos on your hard drive . you can add the camera interface to you but many advanced settings to import images to your night@@ clubs .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; connect them to the computer , turn off the camera on the sco@@ re@@ mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a skill picture at the bottom and the pre@@ views of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc on the camera displayed .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about each entry . with the aspect properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata .
this dialog shows file features and the photo@@ graphic information that is internally saved from the camera . a symbol shows that the picture has not been downloaded at your computer . note that with some digital cameras do not provide all information available .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata like ex@@ if , manufacturing , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as with the met@@ adata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata are not available at some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on their computer , the click on the button download and then download the selection from all . this loads all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae . when downloading the photos do not get deleted and we suggest you check if the images are safe to delete in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select only the desired options selected with the standard choices of &amp; k@@ de ; once you choose the photos , use the button download and then selected the button @-@ chosen as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option new is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; in this case the new images are marked with a star in the window display . if you choose this option , you will be downloaded only the new pictures .
when you download the buttons all download or selected , appears a dialogue with which you can select the target album , in which the photos will be sorted , displayed . details for the folder you can read in section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after which you have chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all deleted at once by using the button Del@@ ete . if you only want to delete some , you must select it first and then use the delete .
note that there are no way photos that you have deleted from the camera , they are completely deleted . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully removed from the camera ; if you want to delete them from the camera . if you don &apos;t want to delete it from the camera , since this is much faster .
cameras use as a fil@@ ename for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive name . this may be deleted once back after the photos from the camera should be deleted . so it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was taken to integrate in the fil@@ ename .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and spi@@ res of the image and for data @-@ based locking . if you use this latter option , a folder per day is created automatically .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos may be stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in section standard author@@ is@@ ions . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish another date format than the default format , you can use e.g. in the mach@@ ining field the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % . % B : % S : % S : % S . for further modifications you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera fil@@ ename , you have the option to change the fil@@ ename in small case letters . or in case letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ ename , which &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; for a photo used , is shown below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings for change will be saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera lens .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; can carry out all the information about the orientation of the camera to the point of recording , to perform an automatic fil@@ ming during brow@@ sing . not all cameras will provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic fil@@ ing is usually turned into , and if your camera does not provide this information , leaves &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic re@@ line , use the button Exp@@ and@@ ed and select the automatic la@@ zing in the bottom area of the window .
when your camera records information about the date , where the photo was made available , can create &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; this subjects are based on image data . not all cameras will be loaded onto the image album . not all cameras will display this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can find out which information your camera could have embedded into the photos .
this option is usually off , and in that case come &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the photos directly at the destination album . if you want to change this , you have to turn this option and select the option dates based on the bottom of the window .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to load photos of their computer on their camera is the button download . select then upload . the file @-@ optional dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears when you can select the files you want to up@@ loaded , you can also choose more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
once the selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; you where the images are to be loaded too . a folder @-@ optional dialog for camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to load the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general concept in this document . thus , a position is targeted in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and that can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be displayed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photo@@ graph@@ s can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ ving an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and imm@@ ov@@ aries can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was made , you can access a browser which allows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; users who want to locate the location of photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is well the positioning data of a photo take part .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , pan@@ es and maps are supported . therefore , there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the correct hardware , using the IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and most recently via the manual input from known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit , but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or by sending the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye I@@ pa@@ q I@@ ke K@@ od@@ ak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3
downloading the GPS data from a device can be made with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save these data in the g@@ px format , since this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , extract data from images and GPS extract and cor@@ relation it . on the following page you can see the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the ex@@ if@@ ying tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign @-@ known coordinates that were created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com does not show European street types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ sts : try to give you much control of his working procedures as possible . there are many settings that added to the behaviour of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; change to settings , you need to choose settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
select action can be displayed on built @-@ in Pre@@ view or picture editing may be set . they set out the standard behaviour of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , standardi@@ zation and copy@@ righ@@ ted data . these data are automatically selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , when the option is to download from the camera application . also with a database synchroni@@ zation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should be the professional design@@ ation of the photographer . this field should be the professional design@@ ation of photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the author , this field must be filled likewise .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if this is a screens@@ hot for such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the image is a bearing picture , then the group or agency should be made available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . it is achieved that the met@@ adata changes are permanently in the picture and not only entered into the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae .
images stored in JPEG comp@@ art@@ ments ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchroni@@ zes the comments that you have to add to your photos , with the images found in the pictures . note : with images , which have already been canc@@ eled , these are over@@ written by the formation of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; over@@ written .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is rests in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; thick@@ er ; supports a number of different image formats and several video formats . to determine which data types &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; indicate , you can add the file content to this list and remove . each file in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner that has none of these extensions , ignored by &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by clicking the button Ref@@ res@@ h right from each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ous of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts , however , can be set on this page to the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ chr@@ ist mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size , you should only use on rapid b@@ ills . if you have one , then you can thus obtain better visibility results .
by default , the image processing takes a black background behind the indicated photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this one here . you can switch the tool@@ bar , if you use the image processing in full @-@ screen mode .
Over@@ - and under@@ exposed parts of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors will be specified here . in the picture editing , this in@@ visibility mode can be entered and off @-@ off .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sam@@ sam@@ pling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color form@@ ations . please read this article in Wikipedia for the further explanation .
with the setting of PNG comp@@ ression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation is reduced not the picture quality , as PNG using a rever@@ sible algorith@@ m . the only effect is that images put more time to exit and pack . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value to a high comp@@ ression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high comp@@ ression .
with the option TI@@ FF files comp@@ ress you can turn the de@@ late -@@ comp@@ ress@@ es@@ hot@@ g@@ chi@@ m for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality , since the s@@ late @-@ algorith@@ m is completely free .
with the attitude of loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can hide @-@ free . even if you &apos;ve written the temp@@ ted h@@ iring settings , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was not yet supported , the met@@ adata were not yet supported , but at the planning stage .
in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae , the picture editing only an image considered for photographs . currently , it is very fast to create a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image editing .
the default value is that all green pixels are equal . if the no@@ ble@@ g green pixels from the CCD sensor can react to ul@@ tra@@ violet lines , this difference creates a bit soft , elimin@@ ating this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the picture a little soft , eliminate the 2x@@ 2 guit@@ ar@@ patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white @-@ off of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the whit@@ esp@@ an is not set . standard is it a fixed color balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card , which was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps more detail in the Spitz@@ federn . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the Spitz@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top quality in the settings . the setting will release some un@@ folded results as it shows the Sp@@ lich@@ ter in various ros@@ aries . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the Spitz@@ federn .
this is possible since blue pixels in general aren &apos;t as quick s@@ add@@ ling as green and red . &amp; di@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still uns@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a matter how much color or white you want .
when selecting the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized for each image individually .
put the L@@ umin@@ ally value to your li@@ king . you probably need to put it a bit higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should be conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digital image process to anticip@@ ate a complete image from the sub@@ stit@@ ched image sensor , which has many cameras and which makes a matrix colour set available . these algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ re@@ construct .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ f : and D@@ cra@@ w introduces you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some testing it has been used . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of Gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m of D@@ cra@@ w . however , it is interesting when you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result .
if you know the color variation of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can set the red and blue @-@ correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a different color correction , as you will be carried out during the pipe conver@@ ts .
a profile transl@@ ates the Far@@ bin@@ ations and gives instructions how these are to be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; information like the Far@@ bin@@ ations of a Far@@ ming in the others are to translate the colors as precisely as possible .
behaviour questions when a picture is opened in image editing / color module with fe@@ ed@@ files .
colors Fol@@ ding the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ got ; exam@@ ines the folder then during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; Standard@@ squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed later on opening the raw file later .
the color @-@ view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures are colored not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be matched to the camera plate and model that you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma or g@@ amma web . currently , there will be corrected d@@ cra@@ w Gamma not for con@@ versions at 16 bit depth . this means you need to perform the color @-@ mapping yourself .
there are more options like the soft @-@ Proof profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer can play a smaller colour area as your camera and some colors will therefore be very saturated . this could you manually correct , rather than rely on the flas@@ hing algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided with them for what is intended for . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles can fit together . this answer is obviously in@@ official :
the Canon type expanded the style for the purpose : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image concerned and image processing measures . through the program , this interface can support &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; many modules have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these modules are then loaded by &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the pros .
short rest for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under settings short command .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the attitudes of Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator adjusted the time between the images , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other cru@@ ising fields turn off the met@@ adata and / or which are in the bottom end of the pictures .
the camera characteristics point on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right top there is a button Autom@@ atically linked to identify . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is connected , swit@@ ched and connected to the pic@@ t@@ sheet mode . currently , here are serial port , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage device . you need to specify here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ , to provide you with your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , turn it into the display mode and turn it off .
try off if &amp; di@@ gi@@ got ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set cam@@ er@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert them here .
with the option confir@@ ming dialog for moving from &gt; images in the tr@@ ash cans , you can adjust the inter@@ pol@@ arity of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photos in an album . in the sections of a photo and del@@ eting one album you can find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar , without any feedback . otherwise , you will have to apply changes with the button tab .
you can also em@@ bed the ad of the welcome screen from &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; in case of starting , this speeds up the starting process of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ;
the setting A@@ m start looking for new photos are forcing &amp; di@@ gi@@ got ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; if something emerg@@ es from the base folder , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; you whether it should remove them from the database .
different color di@@ agrams can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; used to custom@@ ize the main window to suit your tastes . these settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs were defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; includes a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of entry ads .
the image processing includes a range of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; therefore , you may not be part of your distribution . further information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image processing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file number , magni@@ fier and the current image size indicates .
a tool@@ bar at the top and including the tool@@ bar for fast access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of images change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original image before you save file , or the button save from the tool@@ bar , as soon as you have saved the original image as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this you can do with file stor@@ ing as perform .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can re@@ produce the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore or the button The button re@@ produce the image editing in the tool@@ bar . you will lose any change which you have done in the photo since the last time .
nearly every action of the picture editing may be done and recovered . the last action can make you re @-@ cat@@ ching by selecting res@@ ins or re@@ inst@@ ated by selecting res@@ ellers from the menu .
if you are often using this , you should make the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to be dis@@ connected and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to recover .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB , on the back @-@ to or re @-@ establish button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you will receive a contro@@ vers@@ y menu . if you choose one of the menu items , all actions in between also be und@@ re@@ ted or recovered .
once you have started the picture editing , you can move between the photos in the same record or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image r@@ unter , or the entries in the file . if you have any changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; Mou@@ rad , or the icons in the tool@@ bar , or the entries in the shop menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magnific@@ ation factor automatically choose
View Full Screen insert displays the photo in full @-@ screen mode . you &apos;ll arrive in the normal view , in which you will use the Es@@ c key . normally you can change this in the dialog dialog of &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; change this you can call from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; main window . see the section for the setup of the image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select in the menu file image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; printing dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole phr@@ ases . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album ex@@ porting print assist . if you follow the assistant , you just need to make your choice .
das &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; Haupt@@ window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navig@@ ational disk , also in image processing . it is shown when one of the five riders is mentioned :
multi@@ f@@ aches clicking on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear again and again disappear into the edge .
in the procurement view , you can insert plug @-@ in using un@@ limited size or insert . please note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are revers@@ ed after 2000 characters and are illustrated . if you want to use the IP@@ TC cut@@ ters in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after which you commented you either use the button or simply switch to the next picture , the activation are then saved .
besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata into the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a met@@ adata that is always written in the pictures .
the review review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and variety . it can be applied to a single click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box to the fil@@ tering of the keywords , the sample @-@ tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; -@@ session respon@@ s@@ led .
the sample @-@ tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given index . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in finding a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief at the input of key@@ word on a picture series . if you have given various keywords , these are stored for fast access .
keywords can also be placed through mark@@ ings of the corresponding attach@@ ments in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected at the top view and select a key@@ word written in the key@@ word , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection , If you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section .
the side@@ bar sam@@ pling filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - fil@@ ing and search results . if in addition , one or more keywords will be used out of the right , only the pattern of the two are displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop . suppose you have chosen in the main view multiple images to provide you with sam@@ pling . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . as a result , a dialog will ask whether you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example the main window shows the images on a cal@@ ender date . the sam@@ pling filter is reduced to No keywords , which has been chosen with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a key@@ word was pulled out of the right sample @-@ tree on the choice and there . a dialog asks , whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be turned off under settings .
if you usually have created and created with and determine that there would be one or more , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry for which in the database is sear@@ ched . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key grasp , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can add a Advanced search of all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need the cross@@ wise end at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . see the options as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly used it &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you use a color@@ fully work@@ flow , this is the colours available from your camera or scanner , you can achieve a predic@@ table variation of the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a colored work@@ flow you can achieve the colors on your monitor those of your camera or scanner , and which suit the colors you print or on the web that publish your digital dark@@ room .
if the issue comes on color management , everyone will know which buttons he wants to press for the results that he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information on your local administration system . additionally , you will find links with more detailed information to make your own informal decisions to make you achieve the desired result .
if your image work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color @-@ management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB paint chip . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image balances are via email or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is standard .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and life for everyone so easy , why should we use another color tree and thus have to worry about color bl@@ ends ?
a visual example of limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we really see will be shown below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe @-@ shaped region , and the colours in the R@@ GB Color area , the tri@@ ang@@ ular region .
if you wish to compare the 2 @-@ Dim@@ ensi@@ onale representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , so please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excell@@ ente page and then click on info and then information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ ace .
do I have to do my monitor , if I decided to work only in the R@@ GB Far@@ ming room ?
yes ! if you &apos;re working in the s@@ R@@ GB paint room or not , you will need to monitor your monitor simply because s@@ R@@ GB works out that your ; on@@ itor has to operate on s@@ R@@ GB . if you work as in the Far@@ ming room of s@@ R@@ GB , you need to either use your monitor on the R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve in most cases . use it before you try a further manual process .
the functions norm@@ alize , settle , automatic ste@@ al and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rigi@@ eren Automatic correction always try to make your colours the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which in your photo appears .
norm@@ alize : this method conver@@ ts the lumin@@ ous size values about the entire image , making the dark@@ est point black and the ligh@@ test point as bright as possible will change without its color sh@@ ady . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
ab@@ same : this method makes the lumin@@ osity of the colours of the selected image , so that the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ing of the intensity area is as shallow as possible . thus , the same very good results in improving the contr@@ action of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation which either causes mir@@ acles for a picture or destroyed it .
automatic ste@@ aling : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in red , green and blue can@@ als . they determined the dark and bright border tones and adjusted the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ing area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of one image by moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a re @-@ sty@@ ling of all values in between . this is only visible in full @-@ washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white @-@ tree of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
the white @-@ right correction is something limited because of a color tree can be done with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can perform too far from the original image , in case you can perform the white straight in the Roh@@ amp mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities will be better utilized .
this tool is based on a white @-@ like sal@@ m@@ .@@ mus which is copy@@ righ@@ ted by the copy@@ righ@@ ted of Paw@@ el T. Joch@@ ym . they start it on the menu item white @-@ mounted type of image processing .
the window display can be adjusted within the size . on the left hand side are both the original image and the Pre@@ view of the target image . if you want to see the original version more dynamic , then click on the bottom of the window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in hist@@ o@@ grams .
to the right top is a hist@@ o@@ gram indicated that dynam@@ ically changed , as soon as you change one parameter . this hist@@ o@@ gram is very helpful , even in well illumin@@ ated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or the sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade will be able to improve the shadow of your photos or down .
connecting with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pipe . press this button and then anywhere on the picture show around the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white bar . this type will also be set the temperature and green value automatically .
in addition , you can set the whit@@ esp@@ an with the list of preference . the following settings are available :
the indic@@ ating indi@@ k@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color canal is over@@ exposed .. You will be the combined result in the white picture shown . this is shown in the preview as a re@@ iner indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons stor@@ ks as and store exactly this . any adjustment of the white @-@ bar you have set to save it in a text file and load it later .
the pres@@ et button sets all the filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral white outlet . note that even neutral settings will result another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set here the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ung@@ sto@@ ef@@ e per color TV set . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding needs also more records , calcul@@ ating time and is on@@ ly@@ ric for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter color @-@ administration .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors and value correction . this tool presents an integrated way to use multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you can always find the same correction . in the manual for the key correction you will find further information .
a very powerful way of correc@@ ting problems is the tool for Grad@@ ation that you will find below colors Grad@@ ation in the menu .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; tool color effects will give you four color effects , a solar panel , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a cant@@ onal filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ ari@@ zation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of the picture was completed by the additional light . this had the effect that the ligh@@ tened areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity also controls the solar power . at approximately 50 % intensity , the image shows what is possible . another raise will finally create a negative picture that is not to generate phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar system . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is under revision ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the above &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it diff@@ ers from a s@@ ati@@ ation by making it a stronger contr@@ action that makes the colours brilli@@ antly and smooth . try it simply , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the market name for one at day@@ light optimized converted color film created by the Japanese company F@@ UJ@@ IF@@ IL@@ M . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours on day@@ light and high contra@@ sts . the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as greatly saturated colors are but also some photo@@ graph@@ s , especially those which hardly stra@@ ined landscapes too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameter levels controls the bri@@ ghtness of the result and the sli@@ der repet@@ itions the strength of the neo @-@ light . at large images the filter may ext@@ ingu@@ ish the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color con@@ gl@@ ories and the lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can watch for experiment with the different color lo@@ gs of your photo with the tools in the menu . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are happy with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you are being applied .
if you have a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too great s@@ ati@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for bri@@ ghtness or satur@@ ation will reduce it . all changes you can perform in the preview . if Him take the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Grad@@ ation and the simple lighting / Gamma / Gamma is the tool Ton@@ value correction to improve the exposure setting . even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated , you need for the content explained in this tool only the area of dro@@ ves . concrete the three sli@@ ppers below the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ s .
the window contains a graph@@ s of the Int@@ ensity , a Hist@@ ogra@@ m , of active rab@@ bit , or the selected area . under the graph@@ s are three sli@@ ppers to change into the image and which can be moved to change the Int@@ ens@@ ory values of the picture . the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is the regul@@ ator to move and take care of how the picture changes .
on the right side the original and the preview of the image can be seen . the preview is dynamic , using the settings of the image , updated . on the left hand , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection program can be set , whether the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ es can be displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . in pictures the large areas of a constant color will include the linear hist@@ o@@ grams of a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is usable .
three shelves : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ble values .
the three color pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjusted the input values of shadow , middle and bright notes . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two shelves to be used to change the output values as well as in input values . the comp@@ ression of output values can be used e.g. to create a hidden picture as background as to see something else in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the images will be automatically set depending on the image values of the image .
save as and store : with these buttons , the values displayed in a fil@@ esystem can be saved and later loaded . the Gimp level will be used .
if you use this mode and the three colour @-@ pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will automatically be adjusted for all shade , means and Sundays . activate the color picture to put the input values of the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ s for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ant channels .
the option of the indic@@ ating indi@@ k@@ ator controls all the channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels . here it is an indicator , that is , you &apos;ll get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on seeing the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target picture will display . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier Channel : this selection allows the channel to be modified by the module :
beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logical view . for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera , linear mode is the most sensu@@ ous mode . for pictures with big fields of a constant color created the linear mode a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will continue .
for example , if you want to move a cur@@ vent@@ ary to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dar@@ ker stro@@ kes can be correspon@@ d@@ ingly and that the associated images will be dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings on the area you want to change , a suitable line on the curve will display the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your li@@ king .
save as and store : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each bend that you have created this can be saved in a fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp Short format .
if you create this method and the three colour p@@ all@@ ets buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shade , middle and solar tones . activate the color picture to put the points for the red , green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the option of over@@ load indi@@ k@@ ator controls all shades , to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel sur@@ rendered pixels , you get the combined outcome . here it is an indicator , that is , you &apos;ll get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on seeing the final result .
below you can see a black / white photo shown in L@@ umin@@ ant @-@ canal . shade and Sundays was set with the color @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel @-@ mix@@ er of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; image processing is a tool to improve the channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel @-@ mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mix@@ er the image editing .
with the Can@@ al@@ aus@@ dial box you can select the color for the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ing : this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the le@@ ft@@ ist area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own tab .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture features a vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ing to display the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix the overall bri@@ ghtness . if you can also adjust the appropriate color components , as the channel bl@@ ender then enable DAS to create a great black / white con@@ versions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black / white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of colour comes to a visible pillars , which occur from the colour palette . if that is the case you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me converting it , in which you will reduce the color initial first .
the sali@@ va as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any Mix@@ er settings allows you to save for later and then load . that used file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
the option of the indic@@ ating indi@@ k@@ ator controls all the channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels . here it is an indicator , that is , you &apos;ll get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on seeing the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is rest@@ art@@ ed . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action capability . with the development of digital photographs , black / white a working , as color pictures can simply be converted to the computer . also with a set of movies profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ tering coating with a green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good , all the scenery pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ oc@@ in ( t@@ m ) Green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ tering coating with a orange over@@ head filter . this improved landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus , similar to the 002 C@@ oc@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ ter .
rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ tering coating with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates a dramatic cel@@ est@@ ial effects and can sim@@ ulate moon phases on the time of day . therefore similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ tering coating with a yellow coating system . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ oc@@ in ( t@@ m ) Yellow @-@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates hot bright and middle shades while he added a bit of cold in the shadow of a pressure and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and with it similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; tool texture allows you to apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , irrespective of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the bull@@ ch of an old master , a pop way of portrait out of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu image shows the image editing the image processing can be used for this .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief should have been set to 200 .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image .
keeping an eye on the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep your attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to stre@@ aker eye . under image frames the module can be started off the image processing .
type : with this parameter set the desired cream type for your image . per@@ ately um@@ ran@@ ces the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black / white pictures ) , covering it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a bone @-@ effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the original image size will be bigger than the original one , but the same side @-@ relationship have . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool to cut off @-@ ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a form@@ att@@ ed text in an image at any point . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to used . simply type the text and place it with your properties as you need . you will be the drawing size of image size . the larger the picture , the larger the character set . for the end you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the picture was saved , the text part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kl@@ ess ; tool 1 , you can create a sten@@ cil with an image .
the menu image which can be used in the image processing can be used to move across an image .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should add with maximum comp@@ ression ( 9 ) to the default comp@@ ressing of the file size . whom you want to add an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; mail@@ ing@@ liste di@@ gi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil with the button @-@ folder with the button @-@ folder . select here the folder in which you noticed the sten@@ cil files . these settings are marked for the next start .
after the root folder for the series has been set , a construction structure is reflected in the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . the selection of a folder is updated the pre @-@ tim@@ eline of the work it automatically .
beneath the Pre@@ view are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fier and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button is magni@@ fied the above picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b .
smaller : this button @-@ reduced the underlying picture . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the image to the whole image , you need to waste the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b .
move : use this button to move under the underlying picture below . take the picture and insert it to the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the default size .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; three different tools are available to you . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but especially in dark areas , gr@@ ati@@ fying images .
Un@@ shar@@ fe Mas@@ ke operates at the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ov@@ is@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric dark and it makes it a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gimp and he is copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ perc@@ ussi@@ es may possibly be the best of the three since he really improved the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . this in turn leads to a common color combined with minimal difference . this in turn leads to a common colour defined a little bl@@ ur . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more det@@ ri@@ mental shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for the private user .
in JPEG @-@ pictures a camera is often applied to internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . pictures in the raw format , on the other hand , always need to be squee@@ zed during the processing .
some scanner turn a po@@ orer already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able to dis@@ able you get control of your picture .
in some situations you can obtain useful results by calling for a photo with the Sch@@ är@@ fen @-@ Wer@@ ke@@ zug . this can call you with the menu item cor@@ rigi@@ d shar@@ pen@@ ing .
you should deal with caution because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the shar@@ pen@@ ing of edges , but also intensi@@ fies the noise . in general , the usable technology to raise an image the tool re@@ perc@@ ussi@@ es . you can achieve further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is much easier than to shar@@ ply . use the tool to connect with the menu item cord , and experiment something with settings . the window display on the right side of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the picture . window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should first try out . an increase in radius or amount to strengthen the effect . if you create the Un@@ shar@@ p@@ est mask , the noise and the impression of gr@@ ats close to sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . you should therefore raise images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red image is added to the original . thus , the strength of the shar@@ pen@@ ing is set .
the corpor@@ al value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable differ@@ ing amount . one can thereby define a minimum difference to the pul@@ pit of the filter . thus , these areas are avoided by a soft change between the tones of the shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore avoid f@@ law in facial , heavenly and water surfaces .
this is an example of bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working picture ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling = 0.0 .
this &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; tool re@@ perc@@ ussi@@ es re@@ perc@@ ei@@ ves a picture by enhancing the shar@@ p@@ ness . it uses the copyright protected un@@ protected un@@ folding @-@ filter algorith@@ m of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create an image &amp; quot ; re@@ perc@@ ussi@@ onist quot ; in which there is better approach than trying to raise the photo . it is using a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is using better results as bl@@ ur@@ red mask . you can run it from the menu by using colour reflec@@ tions in image processing .
in practice the circular Fol@@ ding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which results in the mathem@@ atical result of the source pixel , which depends far from the original pixel value . the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel . the causes unwanted results .
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the main parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . you can set a higher value if your image should be bl@@ ur@@ red , but if your image should be very bl@@ ur@@ red .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 and 0,99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ p@@ able effect of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the Rau@@ sch@@ filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the smoke filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still further poll@@ uted .
pal@@ ate &apos;s scar@@ fs : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ pen@@ ing . use this parameter if your Un@@ shar@@ fe Gau@@ ß &apos; is . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , so you may also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / or@@ den Rau@@ sch@@ filter .
die size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ation@@ sm@@ atri@@ x . an increase in die size can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular shar@@ pen@@ ing or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s Sch@@ är@@ fe . however , note that the module will be very slow if you choose great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stor@@ y@@ ors as well as loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any of any re@@ tool@@ ing parameters set you set it will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try all the sections , color and int@@ ric@@ tions on the image before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible immediately , but will leave later unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you want to read pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; win ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ comp@@ ressed image .
generally , they produce better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by causing the in@@ bl@@ ur mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood used as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theoretically , you have to create a sharp mas@@ king , always arti@@ facts arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of in@@ security . it is practically the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters at least as good as the Un@@ shar@@ fe Mas@@ ke . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better for the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for auto @-@ focus t@@ se due .
for more information about the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing systems in digital images , you can read a technical compar@@ ative comparison to English under this address .
the Reg@@ ler Gl@@ ät@@ te reli@@ es the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of the part@@ ment of the dr@@ un@@ ken , in order to generate a more natural pu@@ pi@@ l .
the color @-@ tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes rather than dark , then you can set it here .
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove the desired arti@@ facts associated with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ put algorith@@ m was developed by I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to convert the filter settings , you can use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a homogen@@ eous l@@ ure above the image . a value of 0.9 should be preserved to detail , that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is necessary in effect . please note that the details are always sub@@ ordin@@ ated in the direction of the approach .
straight@@ ening ad@@ diction Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value gl@@ oss@@ ed uni@@ form@@ ly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie gr@@ itt or CCD set , a high value wav@@ eable patterns create . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best located at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . put this value accordingly to the level of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set . the higher this value is set , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ il effect it has to be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorith@@ m is running through . normally here 1 or 2 can occur .
ang@@ ular grad@@ ual da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : ang@@ ular integration of an@@ isot@@ rop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is chosen as well , you should also make small angles for a long run . therefore , you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral ped@@ als &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral ped@@ als in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never bigger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More about quality that you receive by choice of this option is only low . it doubled but the term . we recommend it to allow it .
the buttons stor@@ ks as and loading exactly this . any setting of graphical errors can be stored in a text file and then be loaded again later .
picture error correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button dis@@ ruption .
below you can see how image defects made with little arti@@ facts will be corrected . the module is made on a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . as you see , there is a pecu@@ liar black arti@@ facts in the foreground , that by a bad film storage during the trip , the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; Rau@@ sch@@ icke is a very powerful tool to reduce images . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool presents a sel@@ ectable image filter to remove st@@ ains and other art@@ ef@@ acts which are for example from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove ti@@ ghtening of the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; the effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the screens@@ hot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and an high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gr@@ ati@@ ous rust@@ le , which can be successfully removed using this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you just need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can remove the image . the area moves through the radius and the color in it will smooth@@ ed and thus minor bugs agreed .
shar@@ pen@@ ing : controls the shar@@ pen the filter to look ahead to as@@ parag@@ rap@@ es . if it is raised , smok@@ ers may be er@@ ased . you need to change the edges of the filter if you need to change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and sm@@ elling or lubric@@ ate up again .
edges : controls the exact accuracy of the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not occur the entire noise or gra@@ dients . place it on a value close to the max@@ um , if you want to remove a w@@ aking smoking or JPEG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details .
illumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either paint or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details .
colour : controls the color toler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details .
Gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of dark areas , which typically are more consuming , however , it is also the Sch@@ atten@@ tions .
absorption : controls the alignment of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ gel . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is re@@ acted . if he is lifted up , the edges may occur if he can occur on his minimum , can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at the edges . he can remove ni@@ ps and is the recommended method for it .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction , which you set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the cut @-@ reduction was applied with the standard settings .
sometimes , a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to drop the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than to find an image . use the tool to connect with the menu item cord , and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the window display on the right side of the dialogue will show the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; photo rest@@ ration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photography contacts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artwork from your images . it is very well adapted to elimin@@ ating Gau@@ ß , Scre@@ w , Kom@@ pres@@ sion@@ art@@ ef@@ acts and local mistakes which occur in digital , original or det@@ ri@@ mental digit@@ ised images , and thus gets the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and tex@@ tur@@ key . the text content is carried out with another tool , the pic@@ ture@@ manual , performed . the algorith@@ m to restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ na &apos;s project and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduced : the comp@@ ression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a deser@@ ted Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ g@@ .@@ mus it creates some comp@@ ression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ actor ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ comp@@ ressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons stor@@ ks as and charging all this . any setting of free restoration can thus be saved into a text file and be loaded again later .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore break the calculation at any time using the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ shaped rust@@ le . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ i camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ i camera with a Sens@@ iti@@ vity of 3200 ISO . you can recognize the in@@ famous film gra@@ ins on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example for photo restau@@ ration . this time Tex@@ tures was reduced to an old color picture , applied with a scanner , applied . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts resulting from the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
das &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel permits the hot camera images with a CCD camera , eight were to remove . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PEG@@ Pix@@ i project which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ p .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos a problem since many cameras with JPEG comp@@ ression via a built @-@ built supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ version method . there are currently no manu@@ elle method to choose the bad pixels .
download this file in the assistant with the button dark@@ est . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to take you to the dark @-@ picture directly after you to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous chapter , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correc@@ tive image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and this automatically loads back to the next session .
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the picture . the window display shows the output of the fil@@ tering with the current settings . poor pixels are taken up in all occurr@@ ences .
select an area to see the def@@ ective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter &apos;s viewing . then select the best filter method to dis@@ solve these pix@@ el@@ ves . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it is determined on an average of the neighbouring states . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixel in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this will be done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels have a distance from 1 of the pixel block , will be drag@@ ged for the calculation of a bi @-@ lin@@ ear@@ en surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block will be de@@ duc@@ ted to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) , which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ise the pixels in the block .
cu@@ bic : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be drag@@ ged to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of cub@@ es ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) that is then used to make the def@@ ective pixel in the block .
below you can see the hot @-@ pixel correction on a color picture , from a def@@ ective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ ghtening is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ ment , that is , to correct the no@@ vi@@ ous corners , of an image .
expan@@ sive objective , especially in the middle and large photo @-@ format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sensor sector . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . Tele@@ lenses show under circumstances this behavior .
but he has also dis@@ advantages . many center @-@ filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 with the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . expan@@ sive objective , even with center @-@ filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects arise by movement .
with the great exposure of today fil@@ ment and color @-@ scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter by sim@@ ulating an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation in a commodity pattern which is made without these filters . the tool Vign@@ et@@ ape is turning into a picture . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ ghtening filters and take three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of lighting absorption at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , what an optical filter with a bub@@ ble adjustment of 1 , or acci@@ dentally designed to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ il@@ ities , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
leu@@ ch@@ strength , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the cover of an image with the Vign@@ et@@ ab@@ ort reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the Reg@@ ulators are providing you only positive values , since you only need to increase the settings only .
if you want a fine re@@ sign@@ ation of the target image , so let the values for illumin@@ ants / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the Grad@@ ation of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; image processing from the menu color Grad@@ ation .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ or@@ ange@@ y applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vign@@ et@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ aire and contra@@ sting correction was also carried out at the image with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; Lin@@ sen@@ ver@@ dist@@ ration is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m from David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tions . colour@@ ful dist@@ or@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gr@@ ades deals with the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ ous form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gr@@ ades has a similar spher@@ ical effect , but fla@@ p on the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth ridge is corrected the remote corners of the corner to the second gra@@ ades . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion .
generally : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion second c@@ ades . with negative values they can be corrected by tons @-@ shaped dist@@ or@@ tions and positive values of con@@ scientious dist@@ or@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion fourth grass . this value appears stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &quot; corner parameter has the um@@ ber@@ ated sign of the parameter .
Zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads a correction first m@@ ades through . negative values increase while positive the picture crus@@ hing .
clear : this value makes the bri@@ ghtness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the bri@@ ghtness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the dist@@ or@@ tion . the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as standard values .
the tonn@@ age or large @-@ shaped correction should be done in front of all states or size changes . at best , you can cut this correction than all the first . if you make a picture new and then make a tonn@@ ell@@ ular correction would be the effect of the false Wr@@ ong .
to help you find the best correction to you will display this tool a vertical and a horizontal help line . move it to an important place , like e.g. the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines in this place . afterwards , you can fix the tonn@@ s / k@@ ru@@ ff@@ ling dist@@ or@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you want to correct a cone @-@ shaped dist@@ or@@ tion , the resulting picture black corners will have . you can transform these with the schnei@@ der tool in the menu transform@@ able cutting from image processing or via the z@@ oom of this dialogue .
for most images the tonn@@ ell@@ ular correction is enough . the next logical step for some motives such as recordings from front , frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . keep in mind that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have an easy equ@@ alization of perspective .
this is an example of tonn@@ ell@@ ular correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method of sim@@ ulating infr@@ ared film the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org Website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensor range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window you can select the area for preview . if you can move the red rectang@@ le with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters of fil@@ tration and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to sim@@ ulate the gran@@ ting texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO Reg@@ ler changes the amount of film gran@@ ules and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
as the filter colour channels to re@@ produce infr@@ ared film mix@@ es , especially the green @-@ channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour form@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of an infr@@ ared film based on New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the original image below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a type of au@@ ra in the sh@@ iny .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; filter movie gr@@ itt is an easy to re@@ use tool to re@@ produce fil@@ tration of your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies , such as the B / W K@@ od@@ ak Tri @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturer of great silver gra@@ ins of the photographs .
the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to post@@ p@@ one in the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photo@@ graphic , gra@@ ined sight specially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you must use this filter .
by regul@@ ator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to the control of intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the Kör@@ ner . the standard value is , although often higher values are required to apply to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more bodies , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film gra@@ ff@@ ed on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and working the ( 2 ) . the pack@@ er @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature bilder and Stil@@ live are good for this effect .
there are two shelves to influence this effect . the upper blade cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick@@ er brus@@ hes are better for large images . gl@@ oss@@ ed controls the smooth@@ ing or , from the other side views , the mal@@ eness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the working class is marked with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ ky size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; filter coal drawing is used for color @-@ drawing . the lines that define the reverse in the drawing are empha@@ sized . images of their gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine the scene you have chosen to sk@@ et@@ ting you . this would be good pictures to begin with .
there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper reg@@ ator cho@@ oses the pin size and the under@@ lining the contrast ( gl@@ ue ) .
this is an example of the record filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . the standard settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjust@@ ing the value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; filter Grav@@ ur shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was ste@@ ered in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important thing about the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray one .
the depth allows the contrast to the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork using car@@ ving effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
break@@ water 1 : shares the picture in cells and makes it look like it is looked upon by gl@@ ass@@ blocks .
break@@ water 2 : an@@ alogue to break@@ water 1 is dist@@ orted here a picture here of a different version of gl@@ ass@@ blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can ab@@ ort these effects at any time using the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork using in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom Un@@ shar@@ fe : bl@@ ur@@ red the picture alongside star @-@ formal lines that eman@@ ates from a center point . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotation of the pixels by a focus . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ pose of a revol@@ ting camera .
distance of removal : bl@@ ur@@ red the picture to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back in the background .
lack of movement : caught the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ pose of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photo@@ graphic , camera .
setting flying un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : caught the picture soft into the dark and strongly in the bright notes . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our @-@ photos or to add a warm and subtle g@@ low .
feeding har@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulated the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a random or@@ derly camera .
intelligent Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the bul@@ locks in the picture and wi@@ red them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through the filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make rain drops out on your picture . by doing it gives natural your images a n@@ ish appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m .
dro@@ ple@@ dge size allows to change the size of the tro@@ p . since the dro@@ ple@@ dge size does not increase automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
you can use the &amp; di@@ gi@@ stic ; image editing an area free from rain drops . use the tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should stay freely . if you start after it the filter reg@@ ression , the area will remain free from rain drops .
this is an example of reg@@ im@@ p . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) suggest a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it by Spi@@ eg@@ eln or turning it into the right orientation . the tools that you will find in the menu trans@@ forms and transform sp@@ ies .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
a painting is smaller . the big question is , how can you hold a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information back or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m is used here , making it a good work . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see .
the tool for size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation@@ method that want to share the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge one image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m Photo infl@@ atable was developed by I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you will need to tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider new size and are listed below :
maintain side @-@ ratio : if this setting is activated , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set . the higher this value is set , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ il effect it has to be higher than 3 .
the buttons stor@@ ks as and store can be used precisely . any obj@@ ection for photo can be saved as text file and be loaded again later .
photo infl@@ atable is very quick at what it makes , but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load . you can cancel calculation at any time using the button .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ atable by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the Pre@@ view ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a often under@@ estimated tool to cut a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rectang@@ le , create . you will then see this rectang@@ le while you move the mouse .
if you get rid of the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look at the cutting area . you can change the size of the area directly by clicking on the corners of the rectang@@ le . a new rectang@@ le create you by clicking it with the left mouse button .
once you are happy with the cutting @-@ section , use the button @-@ button button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file to save or file stor@@ ing down in the menu file to save the cro@@ pped photo .
in advance , you can change the size of the rectang@@ le by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain intact .
in the tool Up aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
the tool to cut off @-@ ratio uses a relative side ratio . that means that it is always the same , irrespective of whether you can use centi@@ meters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons for the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
below the dialog you can set with the Max . ratio kno@@ b to the area for cutting on the greatest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool fits into side ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Vertical ) . if you use the access tool for the next time , these settings are stored as standard values depending on the orientation . the changed image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , allowing the EX@@ IF data to reflect the cro@@ pped image and do not reflect the original image .
the settings of the pool@@ ing aid allow you to show help , so that you can put your pictures better together . these support are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ thirds , the harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility of a rectang@@ le in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles towards the di@@ agon@@ als .
Golden Center : the Golden Center is a split that is divided into various natural growth rate , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the inf@@ lo@@ resc@@ ents of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we see as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ ration@@ ale number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you already used to build the ancient Egyptians and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects made the golden sharing at all times when you put your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number after 1 is the sum of its two previous numbers . the resulting part is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that is normally followed as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden center provides need@@ less aid lines when you put a picture together . these assist will be listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you to your goal good results for your photos . compared to the third party , the Golden Spir@@ ale produces a smooth line that leads the eye out through the image along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river .
another rule is the right @-@ corner of the golden Spir@@ ale , also called Golden Rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . that can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye to guide , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden tri@@ angles are also leading from the above golden sand@@ als . their verti@@ ces are the middle points on the sides of the golden tri@@ angles . note that contrary to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tri@@ angle tri@@ angles . di@@ agonal to these lines can be put into place an static object dynam@@ ical .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame generate a effect of the professional photo graph@@ s dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently .
the options Horiz@@ ontal mirror and Vertical are used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image around any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera accurately ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image where things came around a angle . you can repair this with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ stic ; image processing and tool free rotation . choose to transform and adjust the way@@ point .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degree . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right side .
for your help , the module is free to create a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the picture show around the two lines . after you have moved him via an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in previous sections .
once you have fil@@ med a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is the function transform and cutting out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing offers the picture a bit after the fil@@ ming . however , take note of the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tive transform@@ ations are performed by a fix@@ ation of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by the transformation , into pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by the transformation , into pixels .
angle at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed region .
angle right top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed region .
angle at the bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed region .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region .
after the adaptation of the perspective the picture becomes a little poll@@ uted . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you adapted the perspective you get unwanted tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . a way to make this , it &apos;s the image with transforming plu@@ gs from the image processing .
the tool @-@ tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotating , the picture is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectang@@ le is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can transform this module to transform she@@ ers .
configure your image by using the horizont@@ als angle and vertical angle . you can press horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the view@@ ings .
to help you become a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse kno@@ b to fix the lines . you can now use the tool gear to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the bow@@ el , the image becomes a bit wi@@ ped out . for a single coating , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two verti@@ ces twice as much s@@ wis@@ s and therefore you should avoid this .
after the p@@ adding has the picture un@@ nice tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate it is the image with transforming plu@@ gs from image processing .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ ut@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of images with &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ;
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats on their system . but you will always be JPEG and TI@@ FF included .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; only displays files in formats and one of them with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file is shown in the image processing . you can change this list of file re@@ visions the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; accepted in the section configuration you will find further information .
nearly all digital cameras save pictures in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format used . a ful@@ ler description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; supports both formats .
image comp@@ ression is the application of data comp@@ ression products to digital pictures . this gives red@@ und@@ ant information to store in this way the image data on an effective way to store .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same comp@@ ression relationship . the 200@@ 0s version can also store off @-@ free if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the resource image , you can see below Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . in the section configuration you can find further information about the use of modules associated with &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; supports the loading of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted . all support cameras can be seen below on the Web @-@ Page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats produced by &amp; di@@ gi@@ dae ; supported by :

all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ening , sn@@ mp , bl@@ ur@@ red , bl@@ ur@@ red , bl@@ ender mas@@ hing , which is applied to the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture established quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter to the current image . links from him allow five buttons to change the connec@@ tive mode of the subject area . these modes :
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the field right of the selected view@@ points .
horizontal , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the top section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected view@@ points .
ver@@ tically share . the left area shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the th@@ umb@@ nails if the mouse is not in the background and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can turn on to show over@@ - and sub@@ str@@ ate . the colours used can be adapted in the general setup page .

the p@@ all@@ ets files , that are of &amp; k@@ de ; installed , can be used either for the whole system or just a user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot users defined colors and Fin@@ ally used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can choose from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or browse the directory according to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it indicates the color to it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area adjacent to a color to move the cur@@ sor over . then move the mouse with op@@ pressing left mouse button .
if the cross @-@ box Bei@@ m cur@@ sor is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted either , or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected to write . this mode allows you to set by clicking the cross@@ fire under the by@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the promotions , cutting and inser@@ ting .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each colour three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color character , if any further color is followed . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be added as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .
the colours in the palette and the output of the color @-@ selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
choose a color anywhere on the screen and then find it in the color picture on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in the computer science . so far , there was not a modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , are in view of the program author @-@ author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only few functions .
the &amp; cas@@ graph@@ viewer : project has set itself the goal of re@@ placing these programmes by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : is a KDE programme for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s newly calculated and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; to open or to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in one &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
loading of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting at about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack in order to represent more than this node ) .
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that pre@@ supp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graph@@ s required .
the main window shows the open graph@@ s , each in its own sub @-@ windows . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( blank ) list opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
once you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; the main window looks like in the bottom of the screens@@ hot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner will be displayed when the graph is bigger than the palette . you can choose a fixed position of this overview or choose this location automatically .
the mouse wheel use ( high and r@@ under without special buttons , left and right at op@@ pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ Taste ) ;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph@@ s .
if the file has just changed in &amp; cas@@ graph@@ viewer : loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose if the graph should be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can set your decision later , you can use the menu@@ item settings , see also .
when you open a graph@@ ite party out of an ongoing &amp; cas@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ instance open , &amp; eg ; in a file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; cas@@ graph@@ viewer ; for instance , or to present the graph@@ s graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the intru@@ sion dialog .
when start @-@ up , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split onto several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s that are assigned to a page , this page will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph@@ s .
page show with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with a different font .
the page once shop gives the opportunity to specify the behavior when a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; win ; from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program for each time .
the page Open gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a standard behavior for that case ( the graph@@ s in a new window opened or specify in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing session ) or determine that each time is in demand .
the site management administration gives the possibility to set the Start@@ ing of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine when we asked for each conversion .
the context menu , which usually appears with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; it opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose under different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for stra@@ ined graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of stra@@ igh@@ ting graph@@ s . the algorith@@ m puts the edges into the same direction ( from the top down or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few caf@@ eteria .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorith@@ m is the default for un@@ favorable graph@@ s . it uses represent@@ ations under the jumping @-@ hand model . thereby the c@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai @-@ algorith@@ m is used , the syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimension@@ ing sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorith@@ m created for un@@ favorable graph@@ s a jumping model model layout . it uses the fru@@ stration @-@ Rein@@ gold hy@@ po@@ rist@@ ik , and includes a multi @-@ moon sa@@ vi@@ or for the treatment of large and clu@@ ster graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorith@@ m sorted the k@@ not circular , according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and k@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . he is useful for certain di@@ agrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lical structures .
opens a dialog , where you can specify a Lay@@ out@@ command , then run by a shell and the layout of graph@@ s to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a Lay@@ out@@ command you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms special options , or also change the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn .
determined the type of graph@@ s ( directed or un@@ approved ) and uses the standard algorithms for the respective type ( dot ; for stra@@ ete , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ favorable graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed if that is necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . click with this mouse @-@ cur@@ sor on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more help on this item ( if available ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools available to visu@@ alize images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ator , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in the g@@ px @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download the data for you from your GPS device and convert .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alisation Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the top to visual dialogue will then be loaded . in order to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace @-@ file with G@@ P@@ X file . this file contains the same time at the same locations , as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded a automatic cor@@ relation which shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data is recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera will be revers@@ ed with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation to the GPS @-@ time and camera inc@@ ites . the devi@@ ation below are brought together the data . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace details from a place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the pictures . the differ@@ ential between 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options Inter@@ pol@@ ls and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating difference between camera and GPS is , you can put these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to the inter@@ pol@@ ing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you &apos;ve made a number of photos on the same place . because the dialog will use the coordinates of a call to the next you only need to use the button OK to set the data from the current picture .
the loc@@ ating can also be found and set up . select the relevant region and enlarge S@@ e.@@ Add this over again , until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can always be selected manually . the map can be changed between maps , satellite television and a mixed mode .
entirely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a slideshow from HTML pages to version 4.01 . you can select the albums which can be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the char@@ set is set for U@@ TF @-@ 8 to provide a best internation@@ alisation .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted . the tab is allowed to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to choose the albums you choose . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the Text may appear in the header of the HTML page .
the rider outlines the general appearance and layout for each side . this rider is largely explained . the option for each image is created . if you then click on a picture to see a new page in which the picture is displayed . otherwise the image is displayed directly with your default reference , &amp; eg . k@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your images . select a folder from which you may have writing . a sub @-@ folder containing the name of KI@@ PI@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . it also influences the file size . all other settings are explained .
the rider &apos;s painting allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the view@@ ings that are small pictures displayed in the gallery .
a progress window indicates the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
when the module created the pages the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine whether you have occurred during production . your navig@@ ator will automatically start at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press Cl@@ ose around the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image concerned is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool to view images .

after starting a picture is displayed by default in full @-@ screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG @-@ free module is a tool to change images without having your quality .
this module allows you to store images in the JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality and met@@ adata .
the consequence of the free storage is it that the file size increases , as no comp@@ ressing the colour @-@ form@@ ations takes place . this is also reflected in the PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org. note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata module currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ liste k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import @-@ function of met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the picture @-@ optional dialog with which you want to select the target picture , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after you pushed onto the button OK .
this function does not work with all educational formats . you can copy from anywhere but not to write in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer &apos;s module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module allows you to insert a base screen . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically selected to the correct size for the video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to pick in the MPEG slideshow . then you can create via extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to create the module .
the images you selected are then listed under image files . there you can also change to type of images or the content of the list .
once you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be chosen from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to select the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds which will display a picture below . a low value creates very sudden , a high against it very gl@@ atte image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should let it black . the name and the path of the created file you can set under name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep in mind as possible with the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify a audio file under name of audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted to your preferences , you can easily drink the making of the movie . depending on the speed of your b@@ ills , you can now easily drink a coffee or drink the di@@ asch@@ au once you are back .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ver or tools are missing , so you can adapt the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right settings on the right .
the p@@ assistant permits it to print multiple images on a piece of paper together in Standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can upload your images stored in one of three formats , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM and convert .
the conversion is based on the command@@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original student from Him is : expect the same results generated as the software from your cam@@ er@@ aman . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ b better results ! .
first select the raw file that is to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image conver@@ ter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the kno@@ ck preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the converting process to optimize the conversion process . the main parameters such as Gamma , bri@@ ghtness and Red / Blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later on .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrac@@ ted information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode , R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have an effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the entry result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a cor@@ rupted algorith@@ m and produces for the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the rever@@ sible LZ@@ W comp@@ ression .
if you are planning to process your pictures frequently or later on , you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allowed a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ating . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you are JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ adata contained in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , so you can break down .
the stack @-@ device mode allows you to convert different images at a time . use this mode so if you are sure , e.g. by testing at a single picture which are the best settings .
the settings available are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is helpful to re@@ write the existing file automatically . however , this is helpful if these are created in a earlier attempt . a preview is not available at how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can put the pre@@ fix , the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amp that should be used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . you can enlarge the image or enlarge . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen .
not proportional : no dis@@ proportion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
pressure preparation : prepare the image for the photo@@ graphic print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ iers . the target image , including background size , random size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the photos previously . you can draw on the list of images to be drawn and show there .
after which you started the module , the images will be shown in window frames with the pictures selected . you can add additional pictures with a fil@@ ename . for the last picture , a preview is shown on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and drop it down to add the list of images to scor@@ ing images .
with the button images remove the selected images removed from the list of images to vertical images .
once you have selected all pictures , you can open the new message window with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select is attached as an attachment attached to you .
if you do not send too many pictures at a time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in a fil@@ med file the comments are attached to the images in a text file and attached the mail .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you to the JPEG format .
if you are JPEG under pictures file format and the original files in the JPEG format are then the original exc@@ if@@ s are added to the sen@@ al pictures .
if the process is completed , the window will not be automatically closed so you can see the status of status , in search of errors , but you can automatically start your e @-@ mail program . with the button button , you can log in this window ?
after starting the module , Di@@ stor@@ k appears a window with questions like you want to have shown your slides . you can choose between the photos selected by you and all pictures of the album .
the option OpenGL outputs in the presentation will be activated very elegant lines through OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the fil@@ ename view indicates that the fil@@ ename of the images in the lower left corner will display during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c ; Canc@@ el .
the option images are by chance select that the images are shown in a random order . thus , it is not used the order of images in the album .
while delay between images can be set the temporary distance between each images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen trans@@ itional effect . so you should fl@@ ot@@ test before you show the presentation of your friends !
there is more than a dozen trans@@ itions of which you can choose . by chance , by any transition between pictures has a different effect .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it off .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , to the previous and to stop the next image and stop the slides .
at the left of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; dates currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org. note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool to set an image as a background image for the work surface .
this module combines the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your KDE work surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through this brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture , are available in each group , so in people , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have provided information when you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current pre@@ views . in the following each one is described for themselves .
when you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you choose another person to select only the pictures on which both individuals are displayed . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images of a few thousand pictures to a few individual images .
if you have chosen all the people , places and other settings , you can view images to view the images of your efficiency .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save a custom image , this also applies to places , keywords , and other categories that you yourself have defined . see the picture .
to view images beside the name , select the button which is located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . note that you can use the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must choose which image is to be displayed for each individual person . in order to see this , you &apos;ll have to display the entry editor &apos;s image ( in close connection ) and select the entry factor to your individual wishes and choose which part of the picture will be displayed and cut off .
when you open the entry in the main window , a dialogue will be shown that the dialog for the fix@@ ing of the image features is very similar . this dialog can once again look at the picture .
if you want to enter a character string into the field lab@@ eling or description , you can also enter a date to search for this text ; the date may be either a part of the total data , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try some features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick@@ set , the screens@@ avers and the intro@@ duc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu for the menu item . then , some example will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a co@@ hesive HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this list can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list will present you data @-@ statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display you multiple different time units . each body then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . in the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the box only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can change the specified view preview view from the database ( when you select a date , the first image will always display the current date in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline will always navigate the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time information will be displayed . you can break the selection by clicking on a beam of tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your paintings . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as a module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s manual ; an integrated version described you can create via the menu file HTML ...
before HTML @-@ pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and destination . in the following each area is more detailed described .
first enter the title of the super@@ bli@@ s and a description that is supposed to contain the HTML file later . at k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ expor@@ ter will be created on the overview page . approxim@@ ate information about the export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed by the viewer also without a description . for example , that all images are exported to a party . please note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images exported . you can therefore not use this attitude to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this field you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings options are clear , why this is not specifically answered .
at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images . by doing so , those who regard your website and possess a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images download the example resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your side cannot change the resolution at any time . so he can easily browse your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time , as if he wants to show a picture bigger he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , you place the different folder and the URL you will be stored where your website is stored .
you can select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for any subsequent proposition a new sub@@ folder .
first you have to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder is saved and automatically added at the next time . this folder you can select either a folder or a KDE Support protocol , for example :
once you have created your pictures , you can check if they &apos;re actually selected all for viewers . if you have created a URL for the basic folder after the pages were created , this folder should be set . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet at the final target folder you need to manually copy it . thus , the import function , see correctly you need to provide the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folder .
the currently described setting options apply all three to basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in these cases , a sub@@ folder created , whose name you specify in output current .
if you &apos;re sitting on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , together with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you might want to create a HTML page about viewing the images . however , if you &apos;re already a lot of time to write the image information , people on the pictures , reception , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not even need to be done .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ kim file . you can import other entries into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ kim files , internal and external . they are different whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is just a short@@ cut to images . the advantage of all images to be stored in the file and that you can pass all the images independently . the obvious disadvantage is however the file size .
you can create a .@@ kim file either directly from the menu file or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ kim file together with a HTML @-@ file , this is an external .@@ kim file .
an external .@@ kim file search the images in doubt . firstly , the images found in the folder of the .@@ kim file . the corresponding images will not be found , so the images of the URL you have to verify when you create your .@@ kim file using HTML @-@ Export .
the following is described in the dialog for ex@@ porting images you can call on the menu file Ex@@ por@@ t ...
the main option of this dialogue is whether or not it should be internal or external .@@ kim files . the following three choices are available :
when the Manual is to copy to the .@@ kim file you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ kim file .
with the option Autom@@ atisch to copy the .@@ kim file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
kim files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been comp@@ ressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not profitable to comp@@ ress the files so you simply choose the option export file comp@@ ressed .
the last option of this page is Maxim@@ ale image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , the .@@ kim file otherwise would not be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that every picture is a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with extension .@@ kim from the web browser or from the menu file import ... choose &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to import and import consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you are the category persons of the import@@ ing file being personalized ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called for your database people . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window which are to import categories of the file imported files and which categories are in your database .
the fourth step allows you to shor@@ ten the categories of the one @-@ to @-@ run file with the categories of your current database . an example here is on the picture .
there must be simple to browse pictures and watch : when you look at images , you often want to view images within different image vacations and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depic@@ ted .
this manual contains the different steps from the ( 1 ) fixed the information about your images , through ( 2 ) the search and pre@@ stige , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adapt@@ ations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program to locking your pictures . but it has been extended and today your videos . at many places in this hand@@ book will be talked about pictures , but frequently , this also includes video with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. a normal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ pp@@ y or re@@ visions at the CV@@ S , where they would like .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your images are stored and used for future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you want to start another database tree with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; setup ... get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following sections of the user manual , you will explain the different settings options .
to the links you see six different symbols , with which you can call for setting options of preview and the options for viewers . for each setting there is a detailed help available by clicking on the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
in it , you describe how you can define different properties , e.g. people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog , which is used to already working existing groups . for any existing group you can select a marking and select a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete membership groups , so for example , all members of one group should en@@ roll in a group , instead of explaining all the groups of a member as well .
when you see the settings options available to you to the fixed selection of the members . with the above listed selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window you &apos;ll find a list of the current category and on the right one list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album , shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as di@@ gi@@ fted and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . approxim@@ ate information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called over the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; are but separate . however , most modules have a help page which you can call over the modules ourselves .
since the modules are used by multiple applications along with each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore only very little tested using the demo database ; demo @-@ database you can either call on your own pictures . &quot; demo @-@ database you can either call the command line &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or over the menu Help . say not , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not working . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported their images in albums : this type of order does not support , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order by albums so that you can use the functions associated with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
thus sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds with the current view , so all the pictures that give you the picture look at the moment .
beside the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in the game dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you use for example the category people , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do you decide whether you could have selected persons and pass this on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog , and select in the section modules which modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you see an example of a grid screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other KDE application , take a look at the top of a menu - and a tool@@ bar . in the section you will find no information about your pictures . in the section we will see this window , but now click on the entry images to give you an overview with all the available pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes on the picture , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can place each image individually or for a larger number of images or at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for reading and brow@@ sing as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you can use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the moving of images inside the list : if you have a family celebration and listed on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can make sure that the names used up are postpon@@ ed to find the people more quickly .
if you prefer to see a alphab@@ e@@ tical list , click on the icon for s@@ orting the date below the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images , and select these images with notes . just click on the front and back @-@ buttons , which are at the top right at the top of the picture .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can more comfortable to mark all these images and to use the menu item additional items on one time with a comment .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . moreover , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window which shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the noticeable dial@@ ogs , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also add an entry to a category and set it to make this one sub@@ category of this item . attention , this pre@@ supp@@ oses that you are currently using alphab@@ e@@ tically . see this .
you can move the individual elements of the conf@@ using dial@@ ogs by setting the gro@@ wers who form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which gives you the possibility to store the current construction and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a box completely . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and then window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will receive an overview with view@@ points of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have a filter at all . you can configure the size of the images , by simply searching down the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as a background picture for your desktop .
once you click on an image , this is viewed in the picture window . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display device will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the del@@ e@@ tion button or select in the menu edit selection . now the window will display you see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album : offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use your photo@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use images stored anywhere so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you will have to record the images somewhere , so that you can record the images from the disc . in the picture , you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images , where the right upper hand is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . this is available for example at the images 1 @-@ 9 . however , the imag@@ ines are available , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the preview of these images . however , you can also see these pictures with the image concerned .
as you see it requires that you want files from the folders and re @-@ copy it . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; supports it up to now not you to avoid inser@@ tion of the respective CD . if you wish to avoid any trouble as the m@@ ess turn of your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk in order to store all the images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want a little more privacy if you want to make a little more privacy if you want to make available for others , click on actual view on privacy . alternatively , you can also cover all the pictures that you can see your little sister , thr@@ iller and the menu item all except contemporary view .
with that , you have set which images in the case of the case will be hidden . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu item pictures , giving all the images you &apos;re locked to be hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click Lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered to the un@@ lock of images . to set this password , simply select password in the menu of privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very safe . you can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml to read or delete the password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text . this kind of password protection serves only to those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to those looking at private pictures .
the reason why you manage all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and chat via hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at it sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using a picture _ and video controls , you can preview from the preview , as described , start .
viewers can see the viewer . it clearly shows the picture , but additional all the information you enter about the image , such as who is in the image , when and where was it made , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can simply drag them with the mouse and set it differently . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . you can see the menu @-@ click menu below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the appropriate entries to this view . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you chose people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene has chosen .
if you loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and switch back by using the buttons picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then invites a new image after a few seconds . as frequently it can be controlled by clicking the Str@@ g button and Plus or Min@@ us press . start and stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability to switch from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is able to change in full screen mode . in this mode , the spect@@ ator uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to the full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer , you can use in the image and zo@@ oming . to Her@@ oes button you can easily merge with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us button you can re @-@ extrac@@ ted the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a Zoom @-@ rectang@@ le marks and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can return your z@@ oom so that the picture is not shown to be zo@@ omed . with the same key uses the zo@@ oms , so that every pixels in the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that are in and out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ar paste .
with the functions from the context menu you can rot@@ ate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you &apos;ll have a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . in the moment you can open the picture and enter the configuration dialog of the picture to give this name . but you might not prefer to mark the picture and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to see the pictures taken on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and watch them as good or bad while you are watching one by one .
for the two examples above , the spect@@ ator has the opportunity to show pictures with characteristics while you watch them . features are the letters A to Z and you can press a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter . in see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have put characteristics on your pictures , these are available to you in the browser . so you can see all the images you edit , print or whatever selected , so you can simply use all the images to copy the selected images on a CD , or whatever you want to make .
categories and special features can be displayed in the view@@ view . if you can display categories in d@@ r view , then you can press features to the images by pressing the letter for the attri@@ bute after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you allow yourself &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
the mix@@ er will not be saved with the image but in the database . to the type you can easily do your own old later .
in you can see an image on the painted picture . in order to switch to the Mal@@ mo@@ dus of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to switch off on the image paint from the context menu . to finish the painting , you simply add the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you must fully control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray , but the documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray : should you absolutely read and understood .
at the object tree you can select single objects . then their properties are shown in the object properties and display the object in the wi@@ red views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected using the object .
to insert a new object in the building tree , select the position to insert the object and click on the icon at the tool@@ bar , or select a menu item in the menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is inserted , so that you can choose the correct position :
you can either delete items from the menu bar , or from the context menu of right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have altered properties , click to apply these changes . if you have inv@@ ali@@ d values , a message will be displayed with a error code , then you can click the input fre@@ eing , and then click on the changes with the inter@@ ruption .
when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray : user &apos;s documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray : reference to the specified object with help .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray : 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user guide to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray : 3.5 already includes the user &apos;s documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture you can preview a preview in the adver@@ t view .
press th@@ umb@@ nails in the original view and a small example of the scene is executed with the chosen texture . as a pres@@ et , the entire texture will be chosen , even if you want to ren@@ ame a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example , a texture inside a texture Map and not the entire texture Map ) , you cross locally .
the screens@@ hot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is elected , the check@@ points and it will display a small cross in the spiral model view . this cross marks the center of sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifting . you can change the shift through to@@ ken with the mouse inside the whole window .
every object has a spiral point of view . you can specify this value relative to the point of view of the higher level object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their view @-@ level of view is smaller or equal to the tool@@ bar of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window view as a default . the object tree and the view of the building features are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard panels , or if you need any other order , you can set them any number . you can also store multiple lin@@ ders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to an@@ chor a window above or under a view , drag the initial water to the top or bottom of a view . a rectang@@ le shows then the new position .
to create a new column , drag the first to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then ancho@@ red at the right side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you wish to arrange several views over each other , drag the first place in the middle of a different view . you can then change between the views through clicking on the card @-@ box above into the views .
the last possible formation order are down@@ side views : opinions that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to resolve a view out of an@@ chor , drag the initial water on the desktop or click on the little left to the top arrow in the button bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the button bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can an@@ chor them at any given place .
the current window view can save you with view shut@@ ters ... save it . a dialog will display in which you can save the window of under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual has been written , &amp; Pov@@ ray : 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering the symbol ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu view scene .
a R@@ ender @-@ mode corresponds with the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it controls the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a fast viewing until full @-@ quality images .
when you click on the icon of the R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu R@@ ender Mod@@ i menu , the following dialogue will be opened :
each R@@ ender @-@ mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that can detect the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the ri@@ pe image . if you want to ren@@ dering only a small area of the image , select the cross @-@ section sub @-@ section and enter the im@@ part@@ ing of ren@@ dering in the input fields .
in the combination of quality , you can select the properties using &amp; Pov@@ ray : for ren@@ dering it . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user ref@@ lex@@ ion lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual for &amp; Pov@@ ray .
if an image is executed with only one ray of pixel , there can be different mistakes . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or bow@@ el effects , sometimes details are not shown when they are in the representation of less than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray : uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . in general , pictures see this feature better .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and combines &amp; Pov@@ ray : more than a beam of pixels . this technique is super @-@ sam@@ pling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray : supports two methods of super @-@ sam@@ pling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sam@@ pling the neighbouring pixel value . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ si@@ vely ; recur@@ si@@ vely since any pixel ever continues to be split and adap@@ tive because the record prices depend on the different color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam of pixels with super @-@ sam@@ pling . if you set the difference between the persecution of a particular additional number of pixels with super @-@ sam@@ pling . if you set the low value on 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated with a low value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pixels . if the difference between the color@@ value assigned the pre@@ determined thres@@ hold , then the pixels is tested in 4 sub@@ pixel , which are individually pursued and checked on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be set at the bottom .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the production of noise for the ray process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray : the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ dering is diff@@ use ré@@ lex@@ ion . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map , you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent if the associated rays do not have an object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray . -@@ Con@@ soles will be finished . if &amp; Pov@@ ray : un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray , select the menu item Im@@ porting ... and select a file in dialogue window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full command volume of &amp; Pov@@ ray . if when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window will show a list of all messages .
if you do not support HTML @-@ text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , write this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End and / / * P@@ MR@@ W@@ End .
you can export objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , just mark the code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with cop@@ ying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : a scene is ren@@ dering . usually , it is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on help in an individual &apos;s view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray : user &apos;s documentation for the indicated object . place the path to your document and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray : search for external files ( for example high field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file contained in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire @-@ models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the colour for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the colour of the rectang@@ le for the field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type label .
you can set the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context @-@ menu of the wire @-@ model views . you can set here the button separated for shi@@ fts , sc@@ ings and rot@@ ations .
larger values indicate a more accurate steel model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the indicated objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects like the ball , you can set the detailed stage for two directions .
if you cross the High Detailed view for extended proj@@ ections , all the wire open @-@ views are further divided , if the camera uses an advanced projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the sens@@ ory proj@@ ections . this property returns a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time for ren@@ dering .
when you cross the wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the soil , a ground is down below the objects . the soil is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you activate cant@@ onal le@@ asing method , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling , you can set . precise information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mod@@ i .
on this page you can change existing window rules or create new lines . in the section window , it will explain how you can create and store plastic rules .
the combined field standard @-@ window detection : displays all existing window p@@ ments . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen folder when starting the program .
the list of manipul@@ ations shows all existing window rules . a new arrangement can be created with the button Add , and select a select arrangement with the button del@@ e@@ ering .
every window @-@ order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below shows all the views for the chosen setting . new views can be created with the button Add , and select selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with a new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ encryp@@ ted the window under the existing window , with map view , you will receive a map view with the previous view and sound@@ ing the view not in the main window , but generates a separate window .
so you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray : and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , and now you would like to begin with no more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , under its beginnings very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should keep the following war@@ nings carefully before you complain that you as a result will just get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for ren@@ dering can be applied as a result you get a black picture .
when you don &apos;t insert a light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have everything faul@@ t@@ less installed , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre@@ pu@@ re@@ ed shut@@ ters :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so you can expect a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
they often have to use these menus and symbols now so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . highlight the scene and then select the menu item loading . thus , you now have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ pes model shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate . in particular , you notice the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ dering of the scene .
the object tree contains now a new entry with the name camera . if click on it , see the content of the View object features , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation , you will find further details .
don &apos;t change anything about the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that you can change the camera point in view . simply click with the left mouse button on a counter @-@ down point and drag it to the desired location .
when you apply the button or press the input paste , the wire tension @-@ views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . you could insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body qui@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a compreh@@ ensible method for resol@@ ving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually provides a simple way . you can use an infinite level as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button paste or the input paste . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ pes model shows now also the plain , even though at the moment only as a limited ending level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plain up to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you click the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + before the object . in this case you will find the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit among the horizont@@ ality , only to get to know some of these parameters . select and set the values as below :
only select the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialogue will be shown where you can select how the object should be added . please select the object tree . the pig@@ ment will change in the object tree ( name = soil @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course the Pre@@ view of the pig@@ ments only shows a Matt@@ es black material because you can still enter settings for the pig@@ ment . do not always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you don &apos;t want to see color on the header and ball rolling , just click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the soil is now correct . if you ren@@ dering your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color option . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called intro@@ spec@@ tion . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board list can only be used with two colors ) :
select at the object tree every time , and change the colors in the view of the object features :
this step should be done easily since you have already interpreted the basic work method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball is just as easy as the floor can create :
in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . Set the value for radius : on 1 ( do not forget the entry or button to push the button . otherwise , the bul@@ b would float over the ground as you have the floor to move down a unit down below .
of course , the ren@@ dering will now result in a strange result : as before previously , the ball @-@ surface appears like a Matt@@ es black material . put the following step a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can as@@ sign their stuff now . like the floor , give the bul@@ b a pig@@ ment as color :
select the properties below and change the name for example in sphere of pig@@ ment . click on the cap Pig@@ ment , then select one @-@ tone and set the values as below :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features :
then change the values as in the below screen and click on the input paste .
the settings of shine @-@ effect and ref@@ lex@@ ion shows already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even when metall@@ urg@@ ically is not selected at all :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; K@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ ances is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you make a scene ray@@ trac@@ ed , the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the spect@@ ator ( d. h. from the camera that reflected the scenes like this beam through the objects and how atmosph@@ eric effects like for example fo@@ g . thus , the scene will be dealt with pixel pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source , you see also nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene , that is to be det@@ ained , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the extension extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open a new model or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and will replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you already have saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and space .
presents the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last file have been saved .
this menu item you can only select if you have not yet stored changes in the scene .
repe@@ ats the last re @-@ made command . this menu entry can only be selected when you have used loading settings .
saves the current shut@@ ters and opens a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing type of order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and standard behavior .
opens a dialog for change the short@@ cut short@@ cut . you can change with this option to change pres@@ criptions for &amp; p@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands or add new commands .
opens up a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove the commands with this option machine signs for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to use smoking finishes , without any b@@ ump on the surface individually mod@@ eled and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file both for a dump map as well as a texture Map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which can use as modules : very complex 3D models are produced from do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic look .
a texture @-@ map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base , using an image file as a color ticket .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image concerned and navig@@ ator . the application has a file browser in which you can choose images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full @-@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ er ; is very simple . the file &apos;s browser lists files that you can see with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the key return can be displayed .
you can set if any picture is to be displayed in a separate window or if all pictures are always supposed to use the same window .
if you &apos;re looking for a specific file , just type the first character of fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right bottom . if a appropriate fil@@ ename was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the text@@ field through the g@@ aps of Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , Android and processing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; spher@@ es ; set in the two others , short rest warran@@ t for the display and short command of the browser , can be specified using the short@@ cut for the respective window .
this is selected , then the images are open in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color . default is not a full screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still see the current image . this reduces the delay whenever you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; at the end the name of the last opened folder . at the next start it will open up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window @-@ mode , the window is bigger than the image , is also filled in the background with the selected color .
you can set &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , so that only some of the data types are displayed that the program can also be displayed .
with this option for large images the display ster will be enlarged on the full screen . this option is swit@@ ched as default .
determine if the slide show begins with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between image change at a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows to turn right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions is set . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until they are dis@@ car@@ ded by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or to use the sli@@ ders on the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change here the key@@ boards for the different modes of service &amp; spher@@ es ; in the box cards , short @-@ rest warran@@ t for the display and short @-@ rest warran@@ t for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the Date@@ is@@ system ( a window for sub@@ folder and one window for the files ) and the fil@@ ename view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
shows large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shows pre @-@ pieces for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
reduced the image by 10 % . the factor is based on the current size of the picture .
enlarged the picture by 10 % . the factor is to the current size of the picture .
includes the display pad for images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open again .
view the image in original size . this is only sensible if the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of fil@@ ming one that you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; summary foto ; is a &amp; video ; photo editing based on the &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; image editing . &amp; untreated foto ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; project .
&amp; summary foto ; is a quick image processing with some powerful basics . you can use it to view your photos and perform re@@ visions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; it is a show@@ piece ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to its part , at least issues and potential improvements .
&amp; Read review , makes it possible to report as easy as possible errors or possible improvements . in this context , the menu contains an entry or any problems . if you use this , your browser opens a page to the reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to post your message .
&amp; untreated foto : is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo , then we would like to answer any questions from other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to get involved in &amp; pic@@ ture@@ foto ; it is the developer &apos;s mailing list to join . guidance to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo .
&amp; summary foto : try to give you much control of your work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of a free photo . in order to access these settings , you have to set in the menu settings , set in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left .
in the field of exposure indicators , you can choose the color that is shown when the submission or over@@ statement of indi@@ k@@ ator should indicate the colors with what you want to display in contrast . sub@@ str@@ apping should display a bright color and over@@ load a dark color .
the main window of &amp; summary photo ; includes a side@@ bar at the right edge that displays important information and actions available to the selected images . you can see the same side@@ bar in the picture editing . you can see this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is an application for sc@@ ans images , which can no longer sp@@ ans as images and p@@ ents .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is an easy application for sc@@ ans images , which can no longer open as images and save up . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; can store for each image a dialog with automatically generated names and format . the user can store the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your Sc@@ ann@@ ers on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the Command Line &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no standard scanner was specified , then a dialog to choose from the Sc@@ ann@@ ers .
the user can choose the scanner to use and click OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; exit .
the other settings contain more det@@ a@@ illed options of the drivers . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) is not treating these options especially .
to add a picture , the user can only launch a pre @-@ can and then start scan area for the final scan . the preview is started through the Pre@@ view button .
to better select the image better , the user can draw in the image and zo@@ oming from the current selection . he can also adjust the z@@ oom so that the complete preview is fit in the window .
if the picture is selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if before the stor@@ ing a preview is selected in the settings , then the image is displayed in a window shop , as shown below is displayed . if memory is pressed , then the image will be saved and sho@@ ok ? en leads to a departure and you will get back to the main window .
through the configuration settings , the hom@@ onymous dialogue will be opened prior to the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before the stor@@ ing . in this case the option before saving a preview is selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; images saves the dialogue in front of each one sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; this automatically generated with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to save time without a fil@@ ename .
this setting defines where the images stored in the option save time without a fil@@ ename . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder is used as default for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory , and you can change it with the button ...
this parameter is defined a pic@@ fix for the automatically ret@@ arded images and is also the proposed name for the image inside the dialog . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix the jed@@ no@@ x is recorded when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt the image quality to save the image quality . this value also changes the comp@@ ression value when saving . if select the picture quality is not selected , default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; -@@ manual . the button over starts the KDE About -@@ Dialog für &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; . the kno@@ b settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok , use as all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global key@@ pot can be set up by right mouse button in the player window and select glob@@ als buttons , by right mouse button in the player window and set the short command of command .
you may need to create existing multimedia buttons , that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short command will make your keyboard for &amp; Amar@@ ok . -@@ Control Center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly also available in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browser and scripts . an example of call for the D@@ CO@@ P function , could only be like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the layout options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command@@ line options .
you should give the user an feedback if the script should be executed because of a lack of dependence . please check in your script whether all necessary modules are present and use the dialog , so the user may not pass , why a script does not run .
begin aiming &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Flash error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE Bind@@ ings for Ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos;@@ exit
in the folder scripts / maker you will find a lot of templates @-@ scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts . you will quickly determine that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ o@@ K and do Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use command d@@ co@@ p ; , which each KDE installation should be enclosed .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . usually the ex@@ ec function is used . in this way it can be called ex@@ ec &gt; relatively easy here . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send aler@@ ts to all running script . for this reason , scripts used to monitor their standard input constantly and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script may even ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure indicates the script to indicate the setup dialog . to store the storage and charging the setup data , each script should take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the right folder on the folder , where all the data should be stored .

Amar@@ oks script administration may also install script packages which can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) comp@@ ressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) . we recommend a archive @-@ name as for example .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the wi@@ Ex@@ c@@ ab script . for this reason , you should immediately name your script packages right .
the main trans@@ cript must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the lad@@ ders should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to get the file right :
if your script is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and set the link to the W@@ iki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . apps , for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .

&amp; Amar@@ ok , as most applications has some options , which can enable or dis@@ able to activate the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iles options , certain depen@@ dencies have to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the section requirements .
activate Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set without hass@@ le on the intru@@ sion dialog . the introduction of dialog has several cardboard cards to setup the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
player @-@ Windows will display the player window in addition to the play@@ list or off . if the option is swit@@ ched off , only the play@@ lists will be displayed in the play@@ list .
voting bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le@@ verage was compiled . the option is swit@@ ched the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
atmosph@@ eric : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le@@ . this makes the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
voting files with the music files de@@ duc@@ tions : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le@@ . otherwise the .@@ bat files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .

relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from memory of play@@ list , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files will be saved .
up @-@ to @-@ change piece swi@@ vels visi@@ bly retain title that the play@@ list window will keep up / ab@@ rol@@ s to keep the current piece always in the visible window of the window .
while the change of the browser &apos;s browser change automatically shows the context @-@ browser which is played as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section , you can adapt &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s image ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the ty@@ res section you can use the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can use scripts for the following section : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . press to select ... , so you can choose a desired type of font .
with the choice of user @-@ defined colour scheme , you even have the tor@@ ment of the choice and can set its own color scheme . use this one to select the colour palette of color for front and background color .
playing at the start shows that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start the play@@ back will automatically continue with the piece in the place with which she was stopped at the last ending .
the sub@@ window on screen display allows you to use the inser@@ tion of O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is to select the font . click &quot; select &quot; to select from the dialog the desired type of font for the O@@ SD . the ti@@ cking shadow causes the text in the O@@ SD .
its own colors will give you the possibility of adjust@@ ing the O@@ SD colors for font and background . one click on the Far@@ b area opens the dialog to choose the color option . if different colors are not enabled , the vo@@ re@@ produced &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used .
the text@@ field display text introduces the text in the O@@ SD text . through this type of space , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of space available space and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ dict@@ ama users . so you can specify which screen is supposed to appear on the screen of a multi @-@ fold monitor environment .
the card @-@ card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selected box . some drivers even activate more settings in this map .
the map collection is used for setting all settings for your collection . that includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can choose the folder that is to search for music files ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , just mark the cross@@ wise next to his name . this section also includes an@@ ast@@ er@@ fields to insert , as with the selected folders .
sub@@ folder re@@ cur@@ si@@ vely search : these causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders after music is published .
amendments monitor : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . moreover , an incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists are import@@ ing : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collector folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- und .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection added then later in the play@@ list browser .
the part of the bi @-@ database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the Com@@ pre@@ mise driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another institution is in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ ql setup necessary .
the section My@@ S@@ ql @-@ establishment is used to introduce the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under machine : will the computer will enter , where the my@@ S@@ ql databases is set . after that , under port : the port port is given , under which the database is att@@ ain@@ able . name : is the database name , to which the connection is established .
use us@@ ern@@ ame : and password : to enter the data necessary for connection to the database .
the card card duty .@@ f@@ m depends on support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can provide the names of played g@@ aps on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your us@@ ern@@ ame and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
fin@@ ed pieces send and so the profile to update : this setting allows you &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar Inter@@ pre@@ ach call : after activ@@ ating this attitude is called &quot; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interfaces to the each played piece . note : you can see the list in the context of your browser . note : you do not need last@@ .@@ f@@ m &apos;s Profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok , is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screens@@ photos .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package of the package and otherwise no other KDE packages . you have to install K@@ fil@@ bs so ( including those contained in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to have e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have compiled a small guide how to get K@@ deli@@ bs minimal compiled .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pre@@ di@@ ct that your window manager will work on all relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ cop@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will help , for example , we are trying to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ del@@ bs and Q@@ t because they are preparing an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the t@@ agli@@ b library . you can preview the file off by clicking on the t@@ agli@@ b / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the t@@ agli@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang out the cap@@ ut@@ ated file that causes the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and re @-@ create the collection again .
mostly this is that t@@ agli@@ b pic@@ kl@@ ed when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the t@@ agli@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then please try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok . is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ ilers version . if , for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , t@@ agli@@ b was compiled , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x have been compiled , then this leads to to@@ pl@@ aster the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate automatic . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open up at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring off crash and you can send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is due to the fact that many program data can be used as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but not identified as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error in writing the tags from $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script required the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PAN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynam@@ ical play@@ list ) can be easily forgotten . this is a known bug fixes . this allows you to click in the control center under appar@@ itions of symbols and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you can click on a symbol until three times on a symbol until this setting reveals its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : : Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ lie , then check if Amar@@ ok the correct Q@@ t library is used . this enables you to see with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
to fix these bugs , you may need to remove any coloni@@ zing Q@@ t version or remove / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ K finds the right version first .
there are some ways . most inst@@ aller problems clarify the ligh@@ test by using an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or using the developers . use this forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please fill in there only a mistake when you get some error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , there is only a blank play@@ list . how do music pieces come there ?
this is easy . use the file navig@@ ator on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window was converted into the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : STARS appear for the assessment by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , must be displayed in the play@@ list the rating column , click on the title list of play@@ list and select column . click somewhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then choose play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with your mouse to the play@@ list and let them fall out exactly as you would like with other files . so simply this is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the Add @-@ button , the button play@@ list is to store . click on it .
pres@@ um@@ ably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look also to lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context @-@ menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it on the tool@@ bar under extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , this is true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question should be supported by the back@@ end / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so quite each only concei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which are not provided in default ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input paste
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ stre@@ er driver with AL@@ SA @-@ S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio modules . this can be reached by a sound@@ card with hardware mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( e.g. SB@@ live ) .
the output of this command should help you in finding a matter and help a solution . for g@@ Stream@@ er you may need to specify another s@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ ed ) .
that does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media should be de@@ coded . you can only find a white noise . g@@ Stream@@ er is for most people the best choice if you look for a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ stre@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with highest possible priority ( real time ) and increase the size of the sound @-@ bu@@ ffer ( real time ) and increase the size of the sound @-@ bu@@ ffer ( real time ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per SU@@ ID is set :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs to cause the disturbed play@@ back . read this mistake report . the magni@@ fier of the sound @-@ bu@@ ffer in your AL@@ SA connector file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also be well help .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ multimedia fully to obtain the quicker Arts de@@ co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ mer@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
pres@@ um@@ ably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strong for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less lug@@ g@@ ations react to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , that &apos;s a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but when I want to change the Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ab . why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er you must register all components . run G@@ ST @-@ register to register all G@@ stre@@ er components .
read the G@@ stre@@ er FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask at IR@@ C channel # g@@ asp@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok earlier ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ pe@@ g , compile and install it . then run the module folder of G@@ stre@@ er all ff@@ m@@ pe@@ g files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the G@@ ST @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok .
please report it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org if you have a full list of suggestions , please send it to our mail@@ ing@@ list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . place an alarm on your Calendar program and let it run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll kno@@ cked by the gentle tones of the music which you stopped in front of bed .
how to find the current situation in &amp; Amar@@ ok , current titles when you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you Inter@@ pre@@ t and title of the running piece : ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ used ern@@ ame Amar@@ ok player .
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and I@@ hr@@ us@@ ern@@ ame with your us@@ ern@@ ame . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA is available .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ window . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size of the window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse buttons represents a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ sequence into the qu@@ eue a . by pressing the input paste to a search in the play@@ list , the first search results are played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and the play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ ous functions , but what about the icon in the system check@@ out cut off ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser should be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after starting from Amar@@ o@@ K , the collection database cannot be created and the console appear many error messages .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ l MySQL support .
put the CD a , then click on the menu on Audio @-@ CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to normal read , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a cond@@ or@@ or window . for automatic cleaning , you instead take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically this adap@@ ts a previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result .
you can enter the review for a piece by yourself by clicking on a poster in the play@@ list window . then select the rating of a piece in the play@@ list , namely , by clicking on the piece and edit it : rating or F2 . you can edit the review also in the dialog met@@ adata .
the developers did not want to show you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ K . this means : KDE packages have established a set of release frames with the short @-@ set plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ K , but some users can also find annoying . dis@@ able the option icon at the play@@ list in the general settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Sett@@ ings of the tool@@ bar ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create an own . install this then under Amar@@ ok and set up a picture @-@ browser design , click on new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graph@@ ics Inc . ( el@@ t@@ quest@@ .com ) to avoid difficulty , it was removed .
con@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to control and control of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while you are brow@@ sing con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . click on the button bar ( the top ) and select in the drop @-@ down menu Amar@@ ok .
audio cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information that will be played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free us@@ ern@@ ame and a password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , then please the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and thus also caused a lot of error reports .
pres@@ um@@ ably , &amp; Amar@@ ok was installed , before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine this output module is not compiled . you need to configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new con@@ figured and install .
well , I have been and Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules are still not yet available . and now ?
probably you use a distribution which is installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the necessary development files . you now have to install the package g@@ gle @-@ vel . after that , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install again .
I obtain the fault G@@ stre@@ er @-@ Crit@@ ical * * : Factory for &apos;@@ ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er was compiled with prec@@ in@@ ers , this is in@@ compatible with g@@ Stream@@ er . you need to compile g@@ streaming without pre@@ amp . a tip by Mer@@ lin TC : Ver@@ sau@@ d@@ ne you don &apos;t compile L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you get amar@@ ok .
I consider the error message There is no element present to act the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / MP4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to be able to play MP4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ stre@@ er , you need to be easily installed at g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time .
you will receive the fault There is no element present to act the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ pe@@ g .
you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ o@@ K ?
under settings Amar@@ ok set up ... audio output type you the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ ky 8x@@ 0 { type Plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ intel@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio and the output takes place on the USB @-@ sound@@ card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the scanning rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix @-@ device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts is no further taken care of . you may take this issue naturally in your hand ! if you like , you can join the new so much needed tut@@ ors for Arts : )

as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XXX@@ Project method you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string set ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( cur@@ l , Q@@ string set ) void re@@ mov@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string code ) void Re@@ mov@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String image )
with this , it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple file and then add files into the new folder :

&amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ lock@@ ers for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , quite simply audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ers who support these WAV files ( this Ko@@ di@@ ver packages will need to be installed from Linux distribution ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( comp@@ ressed and comp@@ ressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ ressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the f@@ lu@@ st@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . nearly every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ ging pre@@ ached ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ver already exists . but all these programs are usually not necessary to compile something ourselves . however , only the Ko@@ di@@ ver packages will be installed , which is needed . if for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ y- / file format is to be used ? the Wh@@ ich Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ ver , Audio Quality and Com@@ pressed factors .
a word to cop@@ ying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to cover any copy of the CD ; it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD ; just avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ying protection . just avoid the purchase of Cop@@ y @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup is to be done only once ( the path dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , then after the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , about which you can often stum@@ ble in the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ ver programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB is available from the internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step you find further information , such as this program is used as well as screens@@ photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s tab for the configuration of the program .
starting the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of request in the tab card CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case , first the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if a Encoder has been con@@ figured in the fil@@ ename button - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the default . it &apos;s worth note that before the Encoder has been con@@ figured in the fil@@ ename button .
opens the file manager , allowing an already selected file to code is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; to read and code .
opens the way to configure the type of not@@ i@@ fications ( like proto@@ col@@ s , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; stop ) .
opens the main brow@@ sing dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; with different card @-@ maps ( such as en@@ coder , to the setup of the En@@ co@@ ders ) . so far you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and comp@@ ression rates and helps you with choosing the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a lost audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low comp@@ ression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can re@@ produce these files .
among the audio formats , the information caused by data comp@@ ressing according to their psycho@@ acou@@ st@@ ical model , MP3 and O@@ GG , are the most common ones . O@@ GG can have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ di@@ vers are very good audio quality .
o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distribution , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high quality products ( at high bit@@ rates ) but compared with O@@ GG slightly more deep quality at profound bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or machine based on a computer system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices are present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , storage map , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially only support these devices in most cases the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters in audio quality and the resulting com@@ pres@@ sive rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good visibility to most people and most of the music
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should be acceptable for most people and most kinds of music acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereotyp@@ es with high quality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , comp@@ ression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , comp@@ ression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , comp@@ ression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ bio@@ graphi@@ es . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos;s = 320@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ ot@@ ator ; and the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ programm , to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ cis@@ ions , there is often a combination of program settings for the codi@@ cs and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the codi@@ ders declare the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; titles to add the key@@ word ( English : day ) add MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button lab@@ eling in the assistant ) :
that is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CDs , so that all other information can download instead of taking into the machine . it &apos;s worth note that here only by text is said : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc . , not of the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( an@@ ew of the plot : that &apos;s the author meant ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent the information provided by the &amp; CD ; any more or less valuable , so the artist can still be inf@@ lic@@ ted with the artist nor the music business . all the information can be obtained by a b@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ alized .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; is actively involved a cross@@ wise box ( sending a address ) . in this kind of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( This may only be the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator is set up ; for the use of free@@ DB , the geographical at the closest mirror can be used . this saves band@@ width in the network and compar@@ es the load between the b@@ ills .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more specifically , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note is that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package will have to be installed at first if this is not yet done .
to Save the aus@@ cl@@ ed WAV files can be selected by the Ko@@ di@@ erer and thus the desired file format . on the first Open ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( OG@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a simpli@@ fied comp@@ ression for audio data ) on the tab to setup the code . other Ko@@ di@@ erer can be added on this tab by yourself .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed by the corresponding Linux distribution before the co @-@ erer can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined ko@@ dil@@ erer . further information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter of Wel@@ ders Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can get more information about his switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ soles window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced &apos; l@@ ame &apos; by the name of the installed code .
this may have many causes . check the setup of equipment name of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for OG@@ Gs , f@@ lac &amp; etc . ) , try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envel@@ ope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to start everything setup and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sam@@ pling ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . the appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine since it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you &apos;re on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside with the counter ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; something which probably will be done once once and
the second section describes how to read out a &amp; CD ; what has to be repeated for each read &amp; CD ;
here we determine the coding of the code ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it will be determined where files are stored and which structure is used . as we are la@@ zy , we split the program to load the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we are likely not to change it in any reading one &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device @-@ drawing is transferred to the les@@ bian program so that it can read &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real @-@ device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be specified , so helps to connect to the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the system instructions for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map @-@ card General settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts do not do much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be shown as shown in the screens@@ hot .
only When ordering information can be selected , so that you will be informed if you are missing information on the test@@ ers ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . just two entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically can download via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Read the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
the second choice field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately the Read the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk , if you are later satisfied with the database entry and the folder / fil@@ ename or fil@@ ename , you can change it . the directory / fil@@ ename or fil@@ ename with k@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
aside from this example it is further to note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , you dis@@ able the selection of options and free@@ DB is not used . however , this about 620 MB large , consider this twice whether this is worth . to free@@ DB in the Off@@ line mode , the two choices have to be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set on the following map .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for the retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information of the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD is to get to ? read the section on free@@ DB . place everything as it pic@@ tured in the screens@@ hot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and take a look at a mirror server near . on this way the load is distributed between the b@@ ills . however , this setting will function as a first attempt .
both work equivalent to what the server concerns , since however many Fire@@ wall the protocol can bo@@ iling the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol are usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to submit a &amp; CD ; data on the free@@ DB server should be able to de@@ activate the first settlement .
simply take the settings from the screens@@ hot . ( make sure that the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously out@@ going pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time only an existing drive ? Parall@@ el@@ ele Read and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t understand it , therefore simply try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , you cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
customised folder for temporary files : if you cross this an@@ du@@ cks , then / must be stored the path / folder in which the WAV files will be saved . this box is not modified , the files will not be created in a private folder . do not forget that folder if you want to do something with WAV files .
everything to enter as it is in the screens@@ hot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances a bit must be placed right at the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned previously , this is an adjustment for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the achieved comp@@ ression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of tags to version 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; meeting for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
continue the rest as in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this example :
the number of WAV files simultaneously : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to add more than an WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; ended . this configuration is used as standard for each reading a &amp; CD ; used . if you chose the organizational structure of your music smart , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB is to be described , the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each one @-@ going &amp; CD .
since we use one &amp; CD ; use the screen photos a little different from the data for one &amp; CD ; with successfully manually captured by free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of bringing them out of the Internet . comments are indicated to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet happened so now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in the screens@@ hot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you search in section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
note : if the &amp; CD was successfully picked up by the free@@ DB , all songs of the pieces have already been filled out and are shown to the artist &apos;s name and album .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window built , and you can select the database entry , in your opinion the best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the cross field for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have local database , you need to pick the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen foto . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field of the &quot; actual title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be given more in the input field &apos; Aktu@@ elle title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the single comments ini@@ di@@ spar@@ es per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful withdrawal of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty the CD @-@ editor are not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Ed@@ itors ( e.g. if all words are filled with grand@@ parents or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted notes .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary range . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set un@@ restricted field length , at least on what is &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the code &apos;s code settings ; take a look at the section &apos;s settings .
you can change the tag of the created files later at any time with the tag . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not be supported by all the codes or file formats , and see the co @-@ erer in helping to obtain more information .
just select an entry which obviously agre@@ es with the style of the aus@@ el@@ astic CD ; this example is not important since we do not submit the &amp; CD ; data will not be transmitted . for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are found at Rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Ed@@ itors will be back and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album already fills with the entered data which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next row in the window window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the titles of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed over the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles are selected so marked . a simple click on the line swit@@ ched by selecting the piece or select the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at one time .
was started by clicking on the button selection out of the reading process , this window will appear to confirmation . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the rider orders for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is currently read on hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message displays you if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ ver you have not installed nor installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the t@@ mp file and the target folder are not what we have given here in the example . did you check whether you write to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , reading and coding in parallel . note the status of the window at the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found configuration settings to sub@@ press this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able to read this behavior is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in high @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem in simultaneous expression and coding ( of however , two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the qu@@ eue of the code . after the last piece is coded , a small window will appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create comp@@ ressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co @-@ erer of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S , as part of the academic media packages , however , you can already download a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ P@@ ets is . install the package cul@@ ate media from your distribution . if you are reading this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is aimed at people , compiled by source files and not for users who are using a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be tailored to your needs when it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many versions of settings . at best you can learn the step by step , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screens@@ hot of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hi , still am reading ? even if only the aid menu has been cli@@ cked after the first time of the program , without any reference point as it will go on from this sort of empty screen ( especially when at the time of the program you do not find audio CD ; on drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu item ?
what is about ? who reads this , probably has started the program . it should somehow look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot add or change this manual . it is the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ ocre@@ ator ; thought it may do . at least only after hearing with the author . and if you read this , he covered this section and is therefore provided with this proposal .
strange if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Car@@ a@@ ok@@ asp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others it has a real @-@ time @-@ specific and kar@@ ao@@ ke @-@ real @-@ time lighting of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player does not have .

&amp; k@@ mid : displays the lyrics to the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can go into &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( songs event or text events ) . K@@ mid automatically detect the procedure used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the play@@ list of a song , K@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synth@@ esizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can opening the opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can choose the desired song .
you can also let a file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and bet@@ tering the button Ab@@ og@@ ging in the tool@@ bar , select the entry desc@@ ending from the menu item or fill the Le@@ ert@@ paste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece of automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then altern@@ ate each other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece play , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the rain .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can change to the arrows on the left and right of the template ad . to resume the original speed , double click the tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ o@@ paste has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the Le@@ o@@ paste like a pressure on the button &apos; break or selecting the menu entry into the menu item , so down the reproduction . if no piece is play@@ ed while no piece is played , start &amp; k@@ mid ; playing music .
lifts can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use text @-@ event , others use lyrics , others use lyrics . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically established , which a song is used to enable you to manually adjust the entry automatic text selection , is automatically selected the kar@@ ao@@ ke text . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a event type set you select from the menu settings the entries of text events and lyrics . the same function also have 1 and 2 buttons .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you summar@@ ize . these are played in series following . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , open first to collecting the collectors . this will find in the menu collection under the point ... Click New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on cop@@ ying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will appear at the beginning the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the play@@ back in the collectors &apos; room .
to the temporary collection all songs you will not want to add to any other collection .
when the application is used , this collection is not saved . concern you when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , they have to be selected in the collectors &apos; button . there you can add a song with the button to add a song with which you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of an automatic transmission to the collection .
when automatic fil@@ tering for the collection is activated , a piece of opening ( using file Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if Autom@@ atisch add to the collection is not enabled , when the display of a piece , the temporary collection is activated and gel@@ ded . this collection will then continue to add items added .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collector &apos;s collector , select the collection and the desired song and then click del@@ e@@ worthy .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you choose the series following the sub@@ menu play@@ ful sequence of the menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or select a random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the gath@@ er@@ ings , or use the selection list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to jump a song further , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu pieces , or pressing the button arrow on the right .
to reverse a song back to jump , select the button previous pieces , the entry previous pieces from the menu piece or press the button arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the gath@@ er@@ ings , select there to delete the collection and click on the button Clear .
the temporary collection can not be deleted , however , that doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not saved by the aband@@ on@@ ment of &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for synth@@ esizer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events translated into events that synth@@ esizer the synth@@ esizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map showing all events of the change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always leaves a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all Sound@@ cards GM -@@ compatible are ( incl . A@@ we - and CIS -@@ cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI Maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file from your hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file which saves all necessary settings for playing one piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . prerequisite for that , however , that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; END Def@@ ine CHAN@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... &quot; END Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END options ... END
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section is beginning ( except for options ) and END that the end of a paragraph is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may provide for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , as the pat@@ ches of General MIDI are illustrated to your specific keyboard . the general use appears as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM -@@ pat@@ ches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional all@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that this instrument need no gun tip ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a dr@@ um ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun tip . to do so , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( the gun ) , it takes patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is a patch of the patch ( Drum , bas@@ ins , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone is the sound @-@ height of the always same Drum ( as it has some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify as notes on a specific channel or instrument is depic@@ ted .
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important , as is their existence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can use multiple key@@ boards for each channel and each instrument . you just have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ boards are used primarily to form notes on the per@@ k@@ channel channel . see for example the key Key@@ boards .
this section can be used to split some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and the second channel , just make it simple in CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ tools need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section so has 16 lines , number@@ ed from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will of course use the name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch will be used in the patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ gola Patch on the counter @-@ channel channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates whether a MIDI file has been multip@@ lied with the value of Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch using the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to be in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al@@ komm@@ as stand ) .
this setting is needed , because GM indicates that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ b@@ ender event will play with the value of 40@@ 96 . unfortunately , but try some key@@ boards to play two notes up to an oc@@ t@@ ave higher . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you will find in the menu under settings , item MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard , see which tones are just being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument at a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you have changed an instrument , lights are not green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played notes . view in the menu settings below the point channel view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I cannot force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file 4 MB needs ( a comp@@ ress@@ age ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synth@@ esizer you can also change a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ ary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) von &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support was compiled . to eliminate the problem you have to download a source distribution and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all the files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , choose all the files , and draw them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
do not necessarily activate the setting of an automatic transmission to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can use the arrow @-@ button left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow the reproduction . to restore the standard speed you can double @-@ click on the LCD double @-@ click .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ window a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI Datei file ) or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window turns and the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them equal to a collection , turn the setting of an automatic fil@@ tering to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection added .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you only want to play the first file . so , set up an automatic Add to Collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then included exactly this a MIDI file .
then ex@@ clude yourself , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent to me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me to participate in &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take me a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I have printed , MIDI files , make music and propos@@ itions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
they really make me a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group , I will send me a postcard from &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send a MIDI file , but you should contact me as I have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and had to swe@@ pt it to any money . I therefore want to empha@@ size that I can only get to program@@ ere , because if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .

additionally , can be found at ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .ht@@ ml . on the homepage you can browse the development , find information and look at pictures . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synth@@ esizer , as the sound quality is much dependent on your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use a FM @-@ device or an A@@ we card .
if you don &apos;t have sound@@ card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; using the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card , except you can of course not listen to music .
if problems arise , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ pe@@ g . the program is needed for playing video files of M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ ename ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer was installed .
for additional help please check out The KDE site on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the window windows is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . either , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is re@@ printed in it .
it is possible to send the favorite links below the menu book@@ marks but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which will be play@@ able according to each other , so you should use the category Dau@@ ph@@ er@@ ty play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy rules . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category is copied and the play@@ back begins with the indicated entry .
the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , TV and thum@@ b play@@ list may also be changed by direct edit the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not running through an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category click on the menu view and be displayed as the read@@ sheet of a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing your XML files , you have to choose from the menu ab@@ ed with play@@ list and choose either the processing mode , or another category selected .
all changes are lost when the processing mode will leave or another group will be selected without the play@@ list .
owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be swit@@ ched by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by the edit of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can easily be inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / debit / k@@ m@@ suit / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / debit / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation at the starter needs not to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate through the opening of another source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , however , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start@@ up animation may be the ads of a favorite image : &amp; lt ; body@@ work ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ suit ; are in directory tests / some examples of sm@@ il that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider about the configuration of M@@ Player in the configur@@ ations dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; here the path can be adjusted from the M@@ Player and the intermediate store@@ front size from the network and other things .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player clearly visible .
there is no rider for this rend@@ ition in the configur@@ ations dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; . all needs to be con@@ figured through manual content the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa will be played :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even display the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages may be re@@ usable , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the MI@@ ME type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the fil@@ tration of the mou@@ ths of KDE can be specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; is available in a con@@ soles app and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the st@@ amped process is p@@ able . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ suit . ( view , console , or console to consider from the context menu ) .
thus , a checked back @-@ end for a certain MI@@ ME type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined also ) , this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c . for example , ph@@ one@@ on can re@@ generate all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be swit@@ ched , the scanner is used to be used in the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be manually re @-@ edited .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data record ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog to use in the Sett@@ ings - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there you should be detected by which one is selected . ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has included a DV@@ B in it .
since the V@@ DR &apos;s support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( pres@@ um@@ ably this type of playing video devices may be used under Linux the only one that works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension provides for the X server function . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 servers must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally will be used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of origin of this documentation this d@@ vd@@ nav@@ source , int@@ rigu@@ ource , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ es@@ ource , mandatory source , ur@@ l@@ source , vc@@ d.@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are enabled , they begin with the play@@ list of play@@ list .
are there critics as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is user root after inser@@ tion of the device . thereby , it is absolutely safe to put that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive shows .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be checked for their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ Player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time will check the CPU .

docum@@ ent@@ ations : hereby the type of document document describes ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , article &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; excer@@ p@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; re@@ line &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; re@@ amer &#93; , Fo@@ lien &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defines .
coding : hereby the character en@@ coding of the system is set . modern systems are increasingly using the U@@ TF @-@ 8 -@@ coding as standard . best , U@@ TF @-@ 8x should be weigh@@ ed ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contained the most commonly used add@@ itives for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for incorpor@@ ating them only in the cross@@ wise .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Bericht ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ entation of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use of German lyrics .
new users have now no need to worry about . it is a brief description of the functions and further information in this section shall be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other HTML @-@ text Ed@@ it@@ ors - the high@@ lighting of used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the impro@@ per ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; you should have noticed a simple problem search engine . however , you have noticed it by the modest appearance of the output file anyway . however , you can save yourself by the high@@ lighting time and the bot@@ hers .
with the automatic understanding of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a single line ( for entering the text ) and the page loads ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Sett@@ k@@ ile ; typ@@ ing ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; maximum the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is all the most common and subtle element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure , the individual elements can be changed and examined by a mouse click on the question .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; the files can be very helpful for return . once an DVI ; -@@ file &#91; ger@@ Ã ¤ n@@ cal File ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ spect@@ ator to the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source .
an DVI ; -@@ file contained a description of the form@@ att@@ ed document and also other information such as font , or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and t@@ aps .
if you are looking for the items contained in the DVI ; file with the editor and as soon as an element contained in the DVI ; -@@ source code is provided , the exact opposite of it . once on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code was cli@@ cked , becomes the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewers .
Master document : this function is simpli@@ fied at work with multiple files . using a Master document , working with other integrated .@@ tex -@@ files is simpli@@ fied . in the use of a project , a project @-@ wide Master document project can be set out in project project settings .
fast delivery : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if no error occurred in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ File to be un@@ ber@@ y@@ â , and is not a call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the rapid construction .
in view of the be@@ ating the tool@@ bar , the three major items were stri@@ ped out for the quick incorpor@@ ation of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the fast moving of the document into parts , chapter , sections , ... The commands &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the in@@ choice of other forms for example of articles such as tags , fu@@ elling , notes or references .
name : with this command a name for a section , an image or any item is created .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed term ( selection of a selection ) .
when passing quot@@ ation quot@@ ations , a selection list with liter@@ ary uniqu@@ eness is displayed . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ Files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down by the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is for defining the font . it allows the main text to be determined on the main text , the fu@@ elling , notes etc . there are the following scrip@@ tures for reference :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile , there are two choices available : 1 . the Assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document and restric@@ ting the settings . 2 . the document may be written by hand on hand .
the br@@ ack@@ ets after the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the s@@ cri@@ bes does not establish at the beginning , this can also happen sp@@ Ã ¤ ter in the text .
once the above source code was typ@@ ed , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source Code has to be compiled , the sim@@ pl@@ est way to do is the use of the building or the button fast @-@ tone .
the code must be saved from the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storage , the storage is automatically generated .
b@@ lows the comp@@ iling of the document , should be chosen in the log@@ ging for the errors . when using fast @-@ making should be started &amp; Ok@@ ular ; this is not the case , should also notice the log@@ ging .
an environment ( en@@ gl. environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest@@ ful document . for example , a report with the let@@ tering document will have to have . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end { environment } might have been possible to cover the Ã bu@@ d of the s@@ cri@@ t in the surroundings , the &quot; Ries@@ ig@@ â , &quot; ( see HU@@ GE ) .
the Ã hi@@ kes are located only within the area ( of \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no circum@@ ference ( number ) for the down@@ vi@@ zation within an environment .
there are many possibilities to brigh@@ ten the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . it can e.g. add certain fon@@ ts , li@@ king pressure , Itali@@ c pressure , sub@@ missions , sub@@ missions , etc. along with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the c@@ resc@@ ence and is long as long , until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background for writing the source texts with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the recording language was represented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile .
once in the assistant a little text was entered , a few adapt@@ ations for the better read@@ ability of the document should be trac@@ ed . here , there should be a quot@@ ation , a few places in the li@@ pid and cur@@ si@@ v@@ print and a poem to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been seen , using editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window has to be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document may be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simple sample and fun .
DVI ; is a long @-@ term file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ Um@@ wand@@ ler or Computer@@ bild .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file changes the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed correctly ( in the viewer ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code has been created , the transformation can begin by means of other formats in the tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the start @-@ looking for a direct leap from the editor to the wrong position inside the DVI ; file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binder files . here , only Modern under settings will be set up ... tools suitable .
in order to prepare the scre@@ am search , the mouse cur@@ sor is positioned in a line of the source text and slept on pre@@ ach . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewers will be carried out then .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular , with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; to set up as a text editor ( settings are set up ... Editor )
should be displayed in the case of super@@ structure the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewers cannot lie a mistake . should be a mistake , this is displayed in the log file or in the window display .
the log@@ ging file inv@@ ents the error source in the source text . in the editor you can look at the error of previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ t@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ t@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors to see the faul@@ ty line , must be cli@@ cked on the fault in the log file and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to faul@@ ty line .
once the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar is cli@@ cked , a window appears to choose the template for the document . the pres@@ cri@@ es features are :
if you choose a document , a document can be written either from scratch or assistant to generate a new document . further information can be included in the section .
pro@@ visional users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates , created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , it is necessary to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; it can create a new template using a template using an existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a template using a file , some char@@ s are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables can set in settings K@@ ile ... settings General .
when creating a template , it is therefore necessary to know which character chains are to be replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OPTI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in docum@@ ent@@ s. type : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OPTI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wi@@ z@@ ard and the add @-@ to of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been completed :
when creating a new document then it is possible to create your own template instead of by default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created in a simple way to create a template , should be sear@@ ched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting from many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to experience the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin directly with reading the chapter on the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command reference , which can be called the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contained an exc@@ essi@@ onal description virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with ge@@ dr@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ ter Str@@ g button to cover the &amp; tex ; -@@ word meaning that in this way by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when playing the text with ge@@ dr@@ illed lin@@ ker mouse @-@ mouse @-@ mouse @-@ mouse , the full text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons , with ge@@ aring sections , can be considered parts of the source text in the editorial window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to search and up@@ lift the most varied kinds of source texts , for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathem@@ atical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can imagine the spr@@ ing@@ time spr@@ ing@@ es within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ en@@ tr@@ Ã ¤ ge Be@@ es jumping mat or the corresponding ke@@ yp@@ ads are possible to make use of the spr@@ ing@@ est or last jumping mat . this spr@@ ing@@ time is also highlighted that at the first entering of a drawing automatically .
working is probably one of the main aspects when buying a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already outstanding features were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; some commands may include specific commands and commands ; special commands for the text of text are contained in the following commands :
w@@ Ã ¤ h@@ lt a complete paragraph ( group of lines shown on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph there is not one text containing eight lines ( like in other text texts ) . the only preventive things in &amp; k@@ ile . the only preventive things in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the sÃ ¤ t@@ ze are separated by two blank lines .
W@@ Ã ¤ h@@ lt the word under the current cur@@ sor@@ row . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a return scale ( \ \ ) and a detailed star ( * ) at the end .
for spo@@ ilt of a part of the document can be easily removed and by pressing the button de@@ f . &amp; Kate ; offers the ke@@ yp@@ ass C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers using its own commands to contain faster result . below are the following commands to contain the text :
removed a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description of the work@@ around paragraph .
it has already been clar@@ ified that environments also play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , offering &amp; k@@ ile ; for additional commands under be@@ ating environment for a precious simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command is sung to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to the Ã bu@@ ff@@ ing of the surroundings .
with this command is sung to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the chim@@ ney of the surroundings .
when the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , at the end of the environment , is sung by the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of wel@@ ded ambient commands can be lost quickly to the Ã ¼ d preview . this command slept in the last shel@@ tered environment so that the s@@ laugh@@ ing operation structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by br@@ ack@@ ets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important prec@@ ep@@ ts that correspond to all of the surrounding environment .
with this command is sung to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the gra@@ ven cl@@ amp cl@@ amp .
with this command will be sung by the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right behind the p@@ opp@@ ing@@ ed cl@@ amp .
if cur@@ sor is before or behind the gra@@ ined cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , is sung by the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many aff@@ lic@@ ted groups of br@@ ack@@ ets can be quickly lost the Ã ¼ h@@ ensive Grou@@ ps , this command close to the last group so that the wel@@ d structure of &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not sh@@ aken .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; are used two simple trials to use in &amp; k@@ ile . for the purpose of its inc@@ eption , the character is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and includes two tr@@ end@@ ent beginnings for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic case of double initial cover can be set under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and can be postpon@@ ed .
you can also configure large settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or French character . there are also many other languages available .
when carrying Shi@@ ft of Shi@@ ft ; input paste &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent tick @-@ connection is one . if the current position within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is , for example , not only a c@@ eil@@ en@@ cape , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table -@@ environment slept with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to replace bi@@ ased &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can set up under settings k@@ ile ; typ@@ ing ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to classi@@ fy the columns in tables - environments and all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; tries to rede@@ em it . if this tab@@ ulator is possible not to exist in the above line , for example , &amp; k@@ ile , for some intermediate space for the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code embr@@ ac@@ ing has been installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three to need and the other two are for automatic fil@@ ing . all of these modes can be set under settings K@@ ile ... can be set .
at the beginning a new environment by means of the command \ \ begin { surroundings } will be &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ end { surroundings } add to an empty line ( for the text ) .
with the pus@@ hes of the return @-@ button , the last letter of the input is removed and possible to provide the fully @-@ performance list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter also .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameter . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by &amp; k@@ ile , so that a just jump to these positions by using Ex@@ ming spr@@ ing@@ es N@@ Ã ¤ t@@ ste jumping mat N@@ Ã ¤ t@@ ste jumping mat and that can be explored .
under settings k@@ ile ; typ@@ ing ... k@@ ile ; ampli@@ fiers can be made to these lists . it can be used by different winding lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and des@@ pat@@ ches of the general language used .
the command mo@@ dus is for the compreh@@ ension of environments . it &apos;s always possible to have a few letters associated with \ \ begin and the call of the refer@@ enced list is used . on the other hand , the environments often used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the compreh@@ ension of environments .
when calling the ful@@ fil@@ ment mode , the comp@@ elling class or switching button le@@ av@@ ed is automatically fil@@ tered in the area and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and by pressing the input button .
after this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile . realize that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command will be included .
under settings k@@ ile ; typ@@ ing ... k@@ ile ; ampli@@ fiers can be made to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ting Start@@ Add@@ r &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; enclosed , user @-@ defined lists of eff@@ lu@@ gs , which can immediately set up by lÃ ¶ l@@ tere . the lists may include ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l for example the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
is inserted , for example , the letter L un@@ given and the word comple@@ mented , the letter of Str@@ g + Alt Le@@ ert@@ paste , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
Gro@@ Ã &quot; e W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ b have not been helpful for automatic fil@@ ter@@ mination . however , that many wo@@ unds have been written in a document more than once . that offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the perfection for all already written gu@@ ilt .
this mode can set up in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Sett@@ ings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile conce@@ al@@ ment . here also the sw@@ elling value may be specified for the display of the ful@@ fil@@ ment .

the dialogue graphics can be custom @-@ made by graphics as simple as possible . to be the bases of the basics about the graphics formats , the sections and su@@ sten@@ tions should be respected .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for ren@@ dering and re@@ form@@ ations of pages . will the PDF file containing a few &amp; Post@@ Script , tools are re@@ arranged and then loaded with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to watch the result of the work , it has to be re@@ compiled in the source code . all construction tools are group@@ wise in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating awareness .
for the comp@@ iling of the source text for viewer , such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by the macro @-@ key viewers , using old ; 4 the DVI ; 4 the DVI ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file converted into a PS file and using old ; 5 the PS file is viewed .
when using the command brake discs is normally called a viewer after the comp@@ iles . should not be used in an in@@ box viewer , so each time , a new window will appear .
a new project is dedicated to the project &apos;s new project .... here the following information provided for the project :
when selecting the fil@@ ename window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r @-@ Project file .
the script feature of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows for the drilling of EC@@ MA@@ Script @-@ Ko@@ en . the script may be managed in the box in the box .
the API @-@ scripts are not yet developed and can be seen in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first has to be said that the completion of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a rather sophisticated system where the basic functions can be extended by a multitude of different packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; texts : are delivered with many documents . they contain a documentation for the contained packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a full refund for &amp; tex ; and sein@@ e@@ â , is the activation form of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather , it is ideal for finding a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since this is a very large board , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; into three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til now , finding the right document is not always easy . as a possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; the small application tex@@ to@@ t@@ k , which contained a database with all too &amp; k@@ ile ; except for a graphical surface provided .
all documents are divided into categories and the gray advantage is the search for parcel names or percussion . from &amp; k@@ ile , then only the results are displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the amount of the lock @-@ paste the viewer for the document .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source text editor , which can be found on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix systems ; is also part of the Fink project , which means &amp; k@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be folded .
many thanks to those who seek the process of &amp; k@@ ile ; to strive for and d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r many hours for the development of tools , which we can use all under compliance with the &amp; GNU ; -@@ License . current information on the contribut@@ ors can be used in the Men@@ Ã ¼ ber@@ ber &amp; k@@ ile .

the version 3.2 of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and features . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; . all of these tools use com@@ ely as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as sub@@ conditions . the combination comes fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation has worked , knows exactly pro@@ c and how much it is . lift it up a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; just put the symbol for the XML @-@ processor and ready !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is found in the current employment folder , then remove the current employment folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working conditions and enter in the field of other folder the desired folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted each time you need pro@@ c .
as already said , anyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu , there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the one opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then they simply leave the current working conditions . if not , then select the current work@@ station and enter the folder , where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is available .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported mistakes and try again .
if the ver@@ i@@ fies file already marks in &amp; quantitative ; then they simply leave the current file easily . if not , remove the tick on current file and select them to cover the file by other file - file sel@@ ections .
if they only want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , they click the Well @-@ formed Check of selection .

specify the name of the file as the result is supposed to have . the file is usually stored in your native folder .
die plugins , die &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; yourself potentially little to do . this makes the plug @-@ system very powerful . you can not wait from the additional functionality immediately and do not wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . read more about it below .
to install a plugin or a part , we will start working with the plug @-@ in plug @-@ in . this dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all the plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :

often working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can con@@ figured with Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project project @-@ properties are con@@ figured .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can look out even from the list of the team members who he is . this happens by trying the team member out of the list and the button re@@ ign@@ ed as pressed . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears f@@ ett after you are : text .
re@@ viewing and setting up your own identity are important to News and comments . see for further information on notes .
beside the overview of their team there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : it can be created an event for information on the Team@@ leiter when something specific occurs . see for additional information .
event activities are actions that will be executed when something certain in the project happens . an example would be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script containing a file to CV@@ S once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project project settings , and events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the recipi@@ ents indicated in the recipient state . the add@@ ress@@ at can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see in , wei such leaders .
note are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes is simple . it may be selected either the note line from the editor @-@ click menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a comm@@ ent@@ ment followed by indic@@ ating text .
notes may be sent a determin@@ ative member of the team . in this case the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nickname of the project leader sub@@ project leader in the area and sub@@ project lad@@ ders should be given the corresponding area or sub@@ project names , such as in the following examples below .

&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing languages , which D@@ TD @-@ testing is and web@@ based form@@ att@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
the settings may be set up by settings j@@ anta , and settings are called . Dies@@ er@@ dialog spreads about some pages that are addressed to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car @-@ completion can be changed .
large / small @-@ writing of tags : large / small @-@ exp@@ ul@@ sion of automatically added tags . normal Groß / Classifieds means , the tags will be added as they are described in the day XML files .
large / small @-@ writing of attributes , large / small @-@ writing of automatically added attributes , the attributes are added as they are described in the day XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if raised , will be optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; added .
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with exception of the simple tags .
starting and ending day automatically updated : when swit@@ ched , the final subsequent day is changed and vice versa .
automatic issu@@ ing of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding co@@ coding during the import .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using button standard , the standard features can be restored .
standard character en@@ coding : the coding of newly created or in a different manner than with file opening open files ( where the coding of the file can be passed over ) . this setting here is filled by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD was not recognized . however , this setting is done by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies , so that at a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . it is not the same as the sali@@ va of the file . even for even registered documents a backup is being evaluated regularly , according to the time provided .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial department or &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , th@@ umb@@ nails and the source code at the same time .
replace the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface through changing the M@@ DI @-@ Mod@@ i and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other hand . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout layout parameters .
the war@@ nings section is used to control the possibility of turning war@@ nings by An@@ h@@ aken by An@@ h@@ aken by No more inquiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ isation of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in a shared mode .
here the Par@@ ser and the Stru@@ c@@ tural Tree , which represents the representation of the Par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , will be adjusted for details .
in the area of mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , the following actions it is possible to change the solved actions by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons .
in the realm of structural work settings , the visibility of knot@@ s in the tree can be opened automatically . the blank knot@@ s are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , in which the current document has not been found .
the area for fix@@ ing short@@ cuts ( a type of templates ) which can be divided into groups , each can be divided into groups , each for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid , it can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation something else means as in a group valid for Javascript .
here , the plugins are managed to be administr@@ ated . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications of d@@ oom page , which can be re@@ used by each kid @-@ capable application , on the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . if inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin , if it is not on a standard there like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be transferred to the plugin when you start , so it can open up the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only &quot; -@@ Mode : check if the plugin is denied boarding . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store , if this option is not selected .
checked the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the ein@@ ted information is correct . select the saving of the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the error was completely new . the support for the cease @-@ built &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of this , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin concept has been implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a matching de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button Options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger project is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ itation ; interface :
a view in which the content of over@@ w@@ aking variables will be displayed . usually in the left dock .
a view where all holding points , with c@@ eil@@ enn@@ ings and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the link to debug the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or she shares the plug @-@ in with , to debug Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ia . this action is created by default , when a project is opened , which must not be respected by a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that it doesn &apos;t need to be respected by default .
the counter@@ part to debug the debug session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the foli@@ age to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to guide a debug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the View Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , to begin with the execution of the script as well as the currently exec@@ uting line continuously . if this happens when the script is lifted , the finish continues . happens before a debit card is started , the script starts with the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , to commen@@ ce with the execution of the script , without information on over@@ w@@ aking variables and the current tick row . if this happens when a script is lifted , the execution continues . happens before a debit card is started , the finish begins as soon as a requirement is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or includes one .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next directive on the script where possible in functions and includes st@@ acked .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next so there would be the current not .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how you can save &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , to be better .
docum@@ ent@@ ations Ed@@ iti@@ er@@ pak@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS . they allow &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; abilities such as car @-@ completion and cav@@ ities ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s there are in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the scripts folder and the tool@@ bar . day folder includes two file types , the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ .@@ Tool@@ bar , symbol@@ ise the text and instructions can insert more quickly into a document than one user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in for details concerning the conversion .
this document describes how to create the XML files then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also the tool@@ bar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and content of the self @-@ multip@@ lies ; the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . work@@ flows allow a quick inser@@ ting of tags in a document without danger of a writing error .
tag folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day @-@ folders carry the name of the sign@@ post language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ mail )
the table below lists the elements of the day XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and borders is being arranged in a simple way .
this is the root element of an important XML @-@ document . it can only happen once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about himself otherwise nothing .
the type of tags is a script feature . when using is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
only for the type method is valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ but@@ ary group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ tag . that &apos;s a only element type item .
descri@@ bing a attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can only occur once for any attri@@ bute . in addition , it lays the name and type of the attri@@ bute . additionally it contains other tags who will describe how this attri@@ bute is to be displayed &amp; etc . this is an only element -@@ type item .
gives the source texts used for the attributes in the day @-@ editorial dialog and in the attri@@ bute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p Metho@@ den@@ name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a pattern and a method name . the arguments that are transferred to the method . may be empty or % day @-@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ day that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can occur for an attri@@ but@@ ary description only once . it is a only @-@ element type item .
lays the position of the attri@@ but@@ ing of a tags within a dialog . this day can occur for any attri@@ bute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and the size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each and lt ; re@@ viewer ) and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
provides a list of elements that may occur within the serial tags . this element is a only element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all the &quot; XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
blan@@ ks do not affect anything but watch out &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; ; especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced it will cause no leg @-@ out but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools to start up at the above &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; -@@ Windows to start and check @-@ out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this feature is currently not available . currently , the check occurs only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 day@@ XML file . this file describes this &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; -@@ element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ Schema . the fil@@ ename for this day XML file is to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 day@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load feature is described . the fil@@ ename of this day XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
die &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is as fairly simple and there is an editor available via D@@ TD Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ TD settings . this enables di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) nickname = The simpli@@ fied name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname .
an action can set by settings actions ... click on New action to the same dialogue :
this action cover ke@@ yp@@ zel . with click the button user interface can be assigned a key@@ pot ; with c@@ ein the current short@@ cuts can be removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions can be entered into the det@@ ectable settings and when exec@@ uting this action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can modify the document or use ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; yourself are the fast start @-@ up or the different Behold , ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified pole is allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir Vari@@ able in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quantitative / quantitative in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variations to be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file , file : / from the document &apos;s name .
% pid : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods a script can accom@@ od@@ ate from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; on the default entry , can be determined what is sent to the standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually reasonable only with this attitude .
according to the input , the output of this application can be diver@@ ted . there are two types issue : normal issue , written on the standard version ; error messages , which should be specified using the default text written by giving the value the optional output will be set :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in any case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you have to add and configure actions . select settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Aktion Kno@@ pf@@ es at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the day to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete all and , in case the day attributes , and you are planning to use their use , enable dialogue on &quot; view &quot; when available , so that you can enter the action of the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ CP@@ edit ; use of the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic Fur@@ ther programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ CP@@ edit ; uses standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , you choose to edit size others .
please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action is doing , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
with regard to that the day start , I have decided to create a grid kno@@ b to create a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user sign@@ aled that p@@ ecting this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ up ; -@@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK .
push the one button and continue with other tags , so there are still which , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to supplement some usual &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar supplement or it should set this to better overview by some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar to set up dialogue on settings of the tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( not left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow @-@ button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to add a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator assist the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ kno@@ b the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back in the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ bur@@ ner in the right folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust her &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its tool@@ bar ( s ) is opened ( n ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps most men@@ tioning expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ att@@ ing speech which you like most . therefore , this chapter as I describe a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Docum@@ entation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might prove to the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory will check if somebody has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ - / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second we handle here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the docum@@ etary code Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 3 func@@ 1 = func@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 8@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 8@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level domain 4.2 Sub@@ way = Table of Cont@@ ents , # navig@@ able , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .ht@@ ml ... Language Reference = Basic syn@@ tax , ... Basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .ht@@ ml ...
note that before and started and Language Reference . this shows that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess heads ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash . but try it yourself .
note that the contents of the table is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the top of the top @-@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; a folder is displayed ! ) .
blan@@ ks affect nothing but watch out &amp; and &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ; Res@@ ourc@@ end@@ at@@ oms are replaced .
the table section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is to be displayed under writing a &amp; PHP ; script for documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array -@@ function is to be displayed . by flag@@ ging of the function and pressures of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context means the documentation would appear directly here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ binding .
a simple list of @-@ separated context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c , namely after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / usr / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / etc / apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc for local or global use . then you create a folder ( as you set these in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these good and worthy are to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation were used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory measures for the use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the conden@@ sing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or to whom . at different places there is an e @-@ mail menu item , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send email , type tool@@ bar , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates , and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded in our main archive , from where all other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available when our team provides them as accurate and beneficial for publication , to make use of the resources , for what it provides a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is assured , both for our team and for the later users .
while upload , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys you can choose to choose . in the dialog New resource , the input stream ( URL can be empty ) and started with a click of OK the upload .
the upload can upload by the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar @-@ tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templ@@ ates and scripts tree can be started .
after downloading a resource , still before the installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quant@@ itation . in case of problems it is warned and it can then be cancelled . please note the war@@ nings and resource correct , appears a message with the information of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation may be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files needed in the day XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion may be started by the menu D@@ TD loading and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD &apos;s description which is to be used . afterwards the following dialogue :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ itions : die string , die im ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ tp : / / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; after the conversion the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand them and draw full benefit from &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , so that one has to get familiar with these fundamental concep@@ tions . this chapter is trying to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quantitative ; little benefit of these concepts .
in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , the field of work in three areas is divided : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a series of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for each one , the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; uses , available . by work@@ ings about promotions , everything is highlighted as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; saved . this enables the Group of administr@@ ators different to secure ones , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are customised patterns and work@@ stations . local elements are stored in the user index , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all done by &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to work with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply stated , this is most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder @-@ tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all staff members within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editorial window , the construction th@@ umb@@ nails with information and the tool@@ bar . please check in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the box with the right mouse button in order to get an contro@@ vers@@ y with the current document left to get an er@@ ased , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ down menu in the editorial department lead to a further context @-@ click regarding the be@@ ating document contents , such as basic processing steps ( Ex@@ cis@@ sor / copy / paste ) , processing of the file under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , or opening the file when the string is called under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor a file .
at the top of the editorial department , the tool@@ bar of the editors are shown &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Trans@@ itional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; the tool@@ bar is adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if you want to insert on a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; you want to insert the tag for this just one day . you should insert the data for this just one day . you should insert it a day that has several attributes ( such as an@@ chor ) , you can fill in a dialog various fields .
the tree @-@ view ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate and ro@@ am in the information about &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; navigate to open up and ro@@ am . in the presentation with cart@@ els are available for files , project , designs , docum@@ ent@@ ations , scripts , attributes , and documentation construc@@ tions .
project management is a powerful tool that displays all files in the project and allows the sub@@ mer@@ ging of files in the project by using legally mouse @-@ click . actions like Add , removal , up@@ loading or delete the files from the storage media can be performed with which indicated context menu .
another option of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open .
templates may be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only usable in the project . more to templates is available .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of dis@@ integration in Global , Local and Project is also working here . by clicking on the left mouse button you can give the available information to a script . the right mouse button are further functions available , such as the script to start , edit or send us an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking of an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the position of the elementary . through the right @-@ click of a Element@@ it opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other top views . with it , you can change a lot of attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . this allows the content to be exposed to the applic@@ ant , allowing the modification of all available attributes with few clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the Web @-@ technology for your development to find . there can be a pack@@ aged documentation for &amp; quantitative ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be inserted , edited and looked upon .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; two cart@@ ell@@ ants at the lower end of the window , can be achieved over the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window .
this map @-@ top shows information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . so , for example , the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed .
this box art shows all errors in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts that will be executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ aph@@ lu ; work@@ flows are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the appropriate command . the cho@@ col@@ ates of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; sends the tool@@ bar as a comp@@ ressed T@@ ar @-@ archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure these in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; how any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; to pass files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf file a number of options that can be transferred to the configure script . / configure --@@ help you . / configure --@@ help one . the options are easy to understand and not running here .
if you have trouble at the start of &amp; quant@@ aph@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web @-@ development tool for the KDE @-@ surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for a fast web development and combines a well @-@ engine@@ ered development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus began to employ : what would be if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , ext@@ ensible mark@@ up language editor would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest WE@@ D @-@ tool tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , it is &amp; quantitative ; now , when you can define it in &amp; XML ; if one can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be quant@@ ap@@ lu ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the above claim needs to be arrested , that &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; hence , in good use of free software , the idea of why developers , which makes someone else possible ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ old is not only all possible but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; to expand how they need it for their need .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web@@ developers the use of intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can extend the productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ coated movements , scripts and tool@@ bar , the automation can also be able to make a scrip@@ ting language tax . ( read more about it in . )
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly developed to a well @-@ engine@@ ered editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of the documentation is help : / quantitative ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; insert , or k@@ help@@ center help : / quantitative ) .
&amp; quant@@ a ; becomes current and served by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file which is not located , whereby the oldest entry is taken .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section about templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project folder level , only one mistake will be reported .

displays the tool@@ bar to the left of the main window . this column allows you to put bookmark with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other prescribed documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; quantitative ; -@@ projects are stored with the fil@@ ming .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to create files into the current project . the selected files are then copied to the project directory .
sear@@ ched for the project directory according to new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files in your project folder or sub@@ folder and add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transportation methods depend on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( KI@@ O Sl@@ aves ) .
attitudes , as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects find the details explained .
loads a project tool tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project Dir / tool@@ bar and are only applied in this menu when you assigned to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar select : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be set up by settings actions ... can be added via tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , or you will be question@@ ing if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
remove a tool@@ bar from the point of view . that does not delete it from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you are asked if you want to do this .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; -@@ team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens up a new E@@ Mail message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bar to the main server , where everyone can access it . see .
invite one &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or anyone else made someone else and convert to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / re@@ fresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; is useful to re@@ fresh the entities of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global one is and a cur@@ d in the global KDE folder is not available , fails the shop .
this menu includes a list of tags , which are present in the currently invited tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) Work@@ tool@@ bar is loaded , there is in the tags menu a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / action on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog , when there is one . this entry is in the menu tags always present , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .

in the plugins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above mentioned menu points . click on . to click a activated plug @-@ ins de@@ activated .
select the syn@@ tax mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the file ; -@@ version .
select the type of tick @-@ switching identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people the other OS platforms are using . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ int@@ osh .
checks the syn@@ tax of the current document on the basis of the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; thanks to the external application .
immediate re@@ location between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries the shifting sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the map @-@ card mode that is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode that correspond to the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu for each open sub @-@ window contains an entry . with a selection of a selection , the corresponding sub @-@ window will be activated .
swit@@ ched the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window , or off .
the changes in this dialog provides any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser .
directed the behavior of the editorial head . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; one finds details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or which will add and the sequ@@ ences can change .
this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse cur@@ sor but is not yet implemented .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with each open source project the developers can always help help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , find them here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from above down@@ wards , since for example after filling the project called the whole directory structure to the rest of the project automatically completed . all of these paths and author information fields can later be completed with Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project project properties are set .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example foo . when entering the name file the file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; -@@ Project @-@ file . by default , it has the name of the project in small case letters and without a space with enlargement web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can see the server address of the machine , to which you want to access a , except you are using local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ beispiel@@ .de ) or IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets you leave this field empty , the standard settings of the chosen proto@@ col@@ s are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adaptation might be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default navig@@ ator . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files are used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system to the project . multiple files or whole folder can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static we@@ content you want to download and change . in server script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to proceed differently .
p@@ act when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started on new , not an@@ h@@ aken .
with this option all the files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise choice of vou@@ chers .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by An@@ h@@ aken or , by removing the ha@@ ze , sp@@ amm@@ ing out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can upload your work in the menu with project @-@ properties in the menu window , or be altered using the blu@@ ep@@ rint Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ ename ( wild@@ card is possible ) that can be re @-@ read for project @-@ related operations like e.g. Project @-@ folders .
supple@@ mental option to top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded with the opening of the project . can be read more about project views .
there@@ with the requested de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed supports . more information about Gub@@ ed will be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options options . in case the debug tool is described .
in the sub @-@ window profiles can upload high@@ lo@@ de@@ profiles ( see in ) as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile , adding a dedicated se@@ ver to each profile .
in the sub @-@ window system configuration may be added , edited or deleted as well as a mail@@ ing list . see the details .
in the sub@@ window configuration , you can switch event activities and add or delete these promotions , change or delete . event actions will be executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus opens ; the last project that was open . this behavior can currently not be influenced .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project .
the project @-@ based view gives free access to the files in the project . where the files in the current project can be managed .
folder behaviour also as well , however the entries are missing and opening up ... with the right mouse button on the right @-@ click menu :
here , different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the site of the high @-@ read files . see .
allows the ti@@ pping of the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button is shut down to prevent the del@@ e@@ tion .
the password will be kept in the core memory and be forgotten in case of programming . this option is useful when common upload files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password saved on the disk option is not saved into question .
this will stop transferring or simply exit the dialog , if you change your opinion from the up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , many high @-@ la@@ wing profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) to be up@@ loaded on different servers . working or creating a profile will display this dialog :
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for high loads . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this has not to be changed but the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving feature or danger . use them after your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so it can &apos;t be read simply , but anyone with programming .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. , by simple exchange views can be loaded and replace the currently open files and work@@ stations .
views can be opened or deleted in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings of the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , with which you have to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; to its own work method .
as mentioned above are the tool@@ bar in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; the best can be added to the tool@@ bar using tool@@ bar . the addition of the tool@@ bar is dealt with in the section of Add @-@ tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and the icons that can be set up by using the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the new action can be executed , can remove other promotions such as the tool@@ bar , can be specified in the dialog , which can be specified , which actions on this or other tool@@ bar are to be visible .
by calling the Cont@@ en@@ men@@ ü@@ s to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries are in addition to remove the action and have shown action to be edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set in the menu with settings of the tool@@ bar ... and set the settings actions .. set .
Templ@@ ates are essentially docum@@ ent@@ ette , code sc@@ ure and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically such as an aff@@ able file system using ext@@ ender organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or each at the system existing directory in the deposits . templates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lu ; in about the restrictions you imagine for a fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; mit@@ ed templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions attached to each template used before use accurately .
bin@@ ary is anything that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary templates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples may be found in the storage room under global templates . further information on the template tree is available .
documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of this templates , new documents can be created . normally , special framework conditions for the purpose and organise the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples may be found in the storage room under global templates . see in for more information about the templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always included in documents . you can find everything , from a comment on a final note to a complete screen on Javascript or Perl basis . see in for more information about the templates tree .
as the name says , this templates for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organised in a folder structure , compiled in a comp@@ ressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus .
design a document structure according to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File When templates save as local template ....
once that has happened , notice that ( even if it is stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the project tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File When templates save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with st@@ oves and dis@@ assem@@ ble on the construction man@@ tle templates .
the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : the file is available only in a pre @-@ layer folder . it can be used all administrative functions to do so , such as pul@@ ling and t@@ ting or past@@ ing about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in a file tree or in the project files , one can click on a folder right and select Site template to enter a name for the template and secure . by default , the project is backed up , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented precau@@ tion . you can insert head@@ lines and shape , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , files or link with them . additionally , one can keep some things in mind when designing templates in projects very profound .
the advance structure in the sub @-@ window design is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / maker and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / usr / quantitative / quantitative files . each of this folder is equivalent to one of four types of tank , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and to select in the context menu features . the following dialogue appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is ab@@ sent , as soon as the attri@@ bute of attributes is p@@ act .
this is standard activated by default and fits all except the regular folders in@@ correctly . if a regular folder would basically dis@@ able if they were explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text tree . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder .
allow previous or re@@ printed text for templates in this folder . these could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ prints for all templates for a specific project and allows cop@@ ying ingredients into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ prints a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ prints .
in addition , you have a context @-@ click menu ( show right mouse button ) on a complete command collection for adding the folders , or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; HTML text editor , which can be accessed through the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code editor through the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the Z@@ weite entry into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ side and an cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit it and when needed for the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document that includes &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . to edit it , the source text editor is necessary . there are no plans to change these behavior .
the second mode is just like the first one , except that the changes are visible in the source code editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is running . with wi@@ g@@ aps of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , this mode is already active , the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , where the position in the document is maintained .
the syn@@ cing balance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is adjustable about settings Qu@@ anta ; according to choice of V@@ PL ; you can automatically select between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . in principle the recommendation is available : a small margin for fast computers and a large margin for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the tool@@ properties tab is possible to choose . that is the processing of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be created . this serves the reduction of the Kur@@ dish co@@ di@@ ment . so that one can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags will provide the storage of information about the document itself e.g. key words for internet search engines . a click into the list allows the change of content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word key wor@@ ks@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to designing sites in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change on the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules are currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style , by pressing on the file button , and choosing the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is like being in a text processing , through references to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is beha@@ ved as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted through inser@@ ting or removed .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as seen in the HTML @-@ text editor . it &apos;s worth note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. if an an@@ chor tag , surround with text must be removed any other revers@@ ed an@@ chor day .
some tool@@ bar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are down@@ lighted . you will be later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used the tables or lists of the tool@@ bar .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examination of breast@@ feeding . in contrast to other programs for breast@@ feeding the search for certain elements is possible and the implementation of the sub@@ template can be prosec@@ uted .

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ ing . why ? so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the inter@@ performance was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time it had corrected a lot of changes at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts to merge together .
that was used by me only changed the modified lines , but I could not see what changed precisely within these lines . and there was no indication of the places , where perhaps only the im@@ part had changed . this change was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could present differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , all amount of other useful features were added .
for example , if you wish to compare an example quick text , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the even@@ ly windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; nearly into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ Way together is fully supported . this is useful when two people will work independently of a piece of co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and shows simultaneously the result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screens@@ hot shows three Qu@@ ell files to merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and merge complete folder . this screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences in and thick@@ ens the possibilities of today &apos;s control monitors . if you need to verify co@@ gs , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed clearly . if rows are only in a certain number of white signs , one can see a look at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble if someone and the import changes . )
if a file is identical and the other is different in a row , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but you are in different folders , then you can simply complete the type @-@ work by using only the fil@@ ename of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder , folder , k@@ diff@@ 3 folder , k@@ diff@@ 3 folder , k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder , folder 2 folders
the Open @-@ dialog allows the manual typ@@ ing data stream , the selection using the file browser ( file ... ) or the selection of a recently opened file from the pop@@ up . you need to specify a third file ; if you do not have the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
over the folder folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and merge sub@@ folders automatically . if for A file is selected , for B and C , however , one folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
if together , the input field is active , the input field is active for the purpose and can be dealt with . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately set out a output file . you can get this step later on the memory .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the compar@@ isons / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag Tex@@ tt@@ ments from the cli@@ p@@ board to the active particle windows . comparison begins then immediately . in Open dialog , you don &apos;t have to select files you can simply connect the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also run pul@@ ling and drop out : drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes it includes a file such as several similar features . if you want to find out how similar to these functions are , it would create a relatively large effort . you would need to create two relevant files , they can copy in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and then you can easily copy the relevant sections just copy , and then compare .
note : currently you can not pull nothing of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the pit@@ falls of text into a comparison of window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pul@@ ling and drop of text into another program than Ex@@ cis@@ ion and inser@@ ting ( instead of cop@@ ying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
in the upper part of each text box there is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C ) has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while on the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . )
the three code readers are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Sett@@ ings menu ) .
when a difference is recognized , one sees in the color , which file diff@@ ers . if both files differ , the default colour is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) good to see .
left along with the text there is the summary column . when differences were found , the column signi@@ fies the corresponding color . when different programming languages the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , e.g. are white signs only in character and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases relevant . )
the vertical line that divi@@ des the composition column , is interrupted in the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the tick @-@ file is enabled , the line is shown at the cur@@ ved lines .
the result window ( under the comparison ) has also a info line with the wording edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changed &#93; when you have processed the result . usually it contains the automatic transm@@ its already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! up to all conflicts are dis@@ solved , the memory is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons Jump to nights / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when only two associations can be used , each difference is simultaneously a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows that appears to be shown in one of the windows the first line of the group is indicated , and the first line of the group will not be shown . ) This group will then be the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes , by automatic transm@@ issions or by manu@@ elles there will be no more line left in the group ; then there is only a wild@@ card for the event that you change your mind and perhaps yet another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark@@ ings which you might copy and fit elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; se@@ duc@@ tions ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature .
note : if selecting the sources , ignore the options required or ign@@ ed ignor@@ ance C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navig@@ ates mainly with the image run and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons on the left , right , top , end , finish , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the Over@@ roll column can be used next to the vertical plane .
in the Aug@@ ab@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other buttons for working . with the paste button you can switch between the insert and over@@ load mode . ( default is the entrance mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns synchroni@@ zes the view of all windows to the start of the respective group ( as stated in the section as in the section ) and the ed@@ itable ej@@ ector has been explained .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ g @-@ picture up@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image below ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image below ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between the solved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the mark@@ ings into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ g inser@@ tion ) . if this enabled , whatever you mark , automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board copy and copy the manual cop@@ ying . be careful with this option but careful , because you could not acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
z@@ eil@@ en@@ enden are saved according to the underlying system . Unix flavors use a tick pre @-@ feed characters \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use W@@ agen@@ en@@ vor@@ sch@@ ub \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the tick @-@ end of source files not , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ ary files .
the options and the list of the last files used will be automatically saved and in the next start@@ up . ( Menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ user ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also contains fon@@ ces with variable width to choose from , you should not use this however . )
once you activate this option , differences are shown in recur@@ sive script . if the chosen script does not support this representation doesn &apos;t happen at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colours , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be replaced . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically displays an un@@ matched colour .
if this option is activated , the appropriate number of space buttons , is inserted in the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a t@@ ulator sign is added .
if you press or return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . you copy the manual to the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which tick @-@ type you prefer to save . the pres@@ et value is the generally common selection on the operating system .
when compar@@ isons of files tries &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs are not ignored . also during mer@@ ging , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a w@@ allet tip &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others , but then store files with different sizes on page @-@ side comparison , although they are different . if this option is activated , w@@ agen@@ ckl@@ ly are treated , but as a white character may be treated . during which , this option must be de@@ activated . in the pres@@ et , this option is down@@ lighted .
in preference , this option is down@@ lighted . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the outcome , the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white signs .
in preference , this option is down@@ lighted . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs .
intensi@@ vely for even smaller sub@@ missions . the option is activated in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic transmission mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue .
solving automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file being used as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs are used in many files less important . if you only take this from time to time , then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are not ign@@ oring or ign@@ oring C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in chapter on scanning of folders and run through a meeting . look for details under documentation for directory compar@@ ing and con@@ duction .
if a file is stored and already a older version exists , the original version exists the Su@@ ff@@ ix .or@@ ig . if already there is such a back@@ up@@ .@@ id file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .or@@ ig , this will be deleted without further backup .
adapting the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to end and launch , so that the change will be active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set out globally across the control centre . )
the following codes can be set for each entry separately . if you activate this option , you will use the upper settings for all entries .
the code @-@ selected fields for coding appears a short notice , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely information . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this affects how special characters can be handled and interpret . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and combined with different coding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding to be used to save .
if you define Vor@@ ver@@ arbeitungs@@ commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the device commands can only be used with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option one can set the coding of the output of scre@@ en@@ commands .
turn this to push the high@@ lighting of changes in white signs in the text or review page . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are not ign@@ ed or ign@@ oring C / C + + comments . )
this selection is available only when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences appear in a color@@ fully codi@@ fied column column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . however ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is shown next to the normal still a second over @-@ column column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the space on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ends you simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
orders the compar@@ isons to each other or to each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
sometimes , consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the con@@ duction and use the fil@@ ename of the last source file as a pres@@ et name for the output file . ( when this function is used to launch it , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first be given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ l@@ essor , which is exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example for cut trouble @-@ cut parts or to rec@@ ti@@ ghtening .
when reading a file , it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command will only be used when wearing this preview . you can write your own pre@@ l@@ essor , which matches your own requirements . each input line must have an associated issue line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users would not want to program . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this scre@@ en@@ rest warran@@ t for fil@@ ing to convert : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ 1 / &apos; The \ \ 1 in the first Kl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ couple . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other Ver@@ sion@@ ary systems use some keywords ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern of $ keywords \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the Ig@@ nor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ us@@ . g@@ sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9,@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; je@@ der character of &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , thus quasi deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several settings at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed , you can also use slightly different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings include in per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal Pre@@ processor is maintained for viewing and to merge together . further operations change only the data that the z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ ed @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the second processor command will see the output of the normal Pre@@ processor .
the em@@ as@@ essor are very useful , but as with any function , the text is altered or sometimes hidden , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often programmers have to edit programmers in a folder many files . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ kur@@ si@@ v .
... makes for every object a proposal to merge together ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ;
... can sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated and show the sim@@ ulated changes without it really perform ,
... results selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons , and merge different files very similar . you just have to specify a folder in the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folder is mer@@ ged , folder 1 is used as the basis . if no target folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target @-@ folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not merge the merge , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder you will receive a little news window over the current progress . if you ab@@ ort the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
if the scan of the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
every file and a folder of the scan found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually displayed together . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click or using the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu features two features all sub@@ directories and all sub@@ directories listed using which you can catch all the folder and folders .
when you click on a file , the file has started and it appears a comparison window .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the data type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the compositions can not be automatically selected . if that will be mer@@ ging , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as seen in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
for identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folder are considered as identical if its entire content is identical . then you have the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for his color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a paper , which is only green , then yellow is and later when it is old , red is red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy from B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... A and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... B and C identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A one folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge can not be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A one folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge can not be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ise is active if only two folder and no explicit intro@@ duc@@ tions were specified and when the option directories are synchroni@@ zed , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to be identical to both folder . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user looks as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; direct after running , copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders will be mer@@ ged and select the new file instead of session ( in@@ secure ) then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the date is identical . if the files are identical , but the date is identical .. As such errors are not eliminated , the file cannot be started .
during the merge one file has been completed after another . it &apos;s status column shows fer@@ ti@@ ous when the collap@@ sing was successful , and according to other messages if something expected to be completed , you should make a last check and see if the status is all right .
when the fil@@ tering dialog is selected by the compar@@ ative method , K@@ Diff@@ user will display further columns . these contain the number un@@ solved , resolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only appear if three folder is compared or combined . )
you can either match the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the compositions that are selected ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start it together .
please note : if you have not specified any target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode C as the target , B as a destination is chosen and synchron@@ ise , A and / or B is used as a destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries are in the target folder , you may also be displayed in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises :
to bring all the entries together : select directory together / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ sheet ) . to run only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if by contradic@@ tory file types still inv@@ ali@@ d actions exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialogue window will appear with the options run , sim@@ ulate and ab@@ ort .
select sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions necessary with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge an individual file ) , then opens up a pop @-@ up window ( note the screens@@ hot ) .
when you are finished with a file folder , then select directory and press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . so you have the option to choose another promotion for entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with it .
if some entries have been customized , see themselves &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entries ( in the current session ) and results in later combined all of the entries , not again . even if this entries had been completed or not saved , these entries are considered settled . only if you change the merge action , these entries are once again combined .
the Sett@@ ings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Sett@@ ings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section named Directory meeting with these options :
only files that fit in the specified sample are displayed in the Element@@ tree . separate the patterns associated with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ ements : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e. g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not match this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not shown in the Element@@ tree . it can be added more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid plac@@ ements : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .or@@ ig ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not shown in the Element@@ tree . it can be added more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid plac@@ ements : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .or@@ ig ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ em@@ atic generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set specific with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a verse attri@@ bute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems have marks a prec@@ eding point . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is swit@@ ched in the default .
with links to files : if the option is off , symbolic links are compared . when the option is swit@@ ched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in the default .
when left on folder : if the option is off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the links like normal Fol@@ der will be treated and recur@@ sive . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible record intervals , and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is off in the default .
introduces a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple bin@@ ary analysis , and essentially s@@ lower if it is applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare large folder via a slow network , it is possible to compare only the amend@@ ment date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of safety . please be used with caution . this option is folded in the default .
like familiar the ch@@ angel@@ ist date . there &apos;s no real comparison . the files are considered as the same if they are equal . e.g. when cop@@ ying the amend@@ ment date . please be used with caution . this option is swit@@ ched in the default .
activ@@ ates the syn@@ cing mode if two folder is compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals are identical to merge in . also , the results from the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is off in default .
if there are differences , the cop@@ ying of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this will be considered uncertain as it is assumed the knowledge that the other file was not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version will be rec@@ ycl@@ ed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ ine If an old backup file with the .or@@ ig -@@ extension is already existed , so this without further backup will be cle@@ ared . this also applies to the normal merge of individual files , not just the merge whole folder . this option is swit@@ ched in the default .
normally , the folder @-@ merge view is visible to the window display of individual files visible ; you can switch the window p@@ one with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window folder &amp; text window , you can switch head@@ window in the window @-@ menu and turn off through change between directory &amp; text windows between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply using a double @-@ click menu . however , you can have to merge a single file also directly , without having to merge the result , the status will be completed and the file will not be combined again if you run the folder .
however , this status will be lost if you check the directory again : list -@@ menu : new to read
KDE supports networking with the help of KI@@ O Sl@@ aves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folder for opening , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a ftp @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a comp@@ ressed file with a local folder .
one URL has a different syn@@ tax as a local files and a folder . a few things should you consider :
one path can be relatively un@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters have to be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , vac@@ ation@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example has a file named / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by using the protocol . it follows a short list of constraints :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link on a file or a folder shows . then a file is accepted as a link @-@ target . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) .
there is no possibility to edit author@@ ization or change date . therefore , soft the author@@ ization or change from the original . ( consider the option familiar to the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of the reference purpose is currently the differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in differences in the viewer . to kick K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button of the different viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ us@@ Part , from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , when it is applied as a coff@@ in format . it deri@@ ves &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , the program patch starts to restore the missing file .
in the con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ user preview . besides , this is un@@ reliable when the original files since generating the patch file have changed .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons between two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the combined or the same of folders gets not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ user ( well He@@ ist it comp@@ are ) already exists . besides , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL @-@ programs for quite a long time and have learned a lot by going into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone through this way or going to go like this .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably does not have the correct pre@@ fix to KDE released . in the default configure / usr / local , but then KDE can &apos;t find the resources for the interface . ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the README file you will find more information on this subject .
if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white sign is treated differently , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines , next to each other , this one is , but this is , the case .
the editor re@@ alis@@ es for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . that &apos;s needed to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source text and selecting the Kno@@ pf@@ ile A / B / C . however , this important information goes out , however , if the result is simply stored as text file and it &apos;s so much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort has so far been too large . you can restore a certain version through selecting a source A / B / C . order to process larger amounts of text should be created another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src lin@@ ulated ; released and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already used many colors to highlight of difference . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and don &apos;t miss the purpose . do not use another editor .
many good ideas and troub@@ les@@ ies came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest modifications can be found at ht@@ tp : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system to be installed in the KDE . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the README file .
as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems at comp@@ iling . nevertheless difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists .
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or switching ) copies the marked text . inser@@ tion ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or switching ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor@@ row , and re@@ placing the current mark@@ ings .
only differences appear : files that are identical in all folders appear not in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you have to update any changes to these options the folder with the function updates . )
it will only display entries that have shown differences . this also leads to that identical files will not be copied into the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain them , they are missing after the target . ( the behavior will probably be amended in a later program version ) This option is off in the default .
note the buttons for selection of the source with the marking A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the appropriate window to the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be present on the button accordingly .
in preference , this option is down@@ lighted . Under@@ differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ camp ; shows a mini@@ preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop to change its size , ending them or move it . this works both inside a desktop and at several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running on current applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ space .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . however , the context menu has shown the two entries to be p@@ ent ... and ending . if however , on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . if one click , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on working space and ending . the commands also bring the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window onto the full size of the desktop . appears only when an application was cli@@ cked .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when a application was cli@@ cked .
is this cross@@ wise marks , can be displayed within the &amp; k@@ p@@ camp ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ space can be moved .
when this field is crossed , are shown in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
to cross the field , this field lets the p@@ act p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . together with name , the names of Or@@ din@@ al@@ pay will be provided , &amp; eg ; 1 . work floor .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also available as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small window at &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty work@@ space will be shown to make their selection possible .
here , the view of the program window is selected . simple features simple justi@@ fication with the proportions of the program windows . symbol shows the windows with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real programme . remark : Pix@@ lie is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is defined : classi@@ cally leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ layer , known as from P@@ ager applications in some other Wind@@ ow@@ man@@ ies ; wa@@ ver@@ cht displays all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and vertical series , which is very well suited for the representation on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to P@@ ager M@@ ager in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can display and move in size , windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen sa@@ ver . you can use it and use a portion of the screen ; this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web @-@ designers and people with a visual disability . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ likes .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; b , a window appears like above . the main window of the screen . in the following , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fier window .. the picture which is displayed in enlar@@ ging window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , can be enlarged ; the area around the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor like a mobile phone . alternatively , you can write &amp; k@@ likes ; to make a selected screen sets in the magni@@ fier window ( selection window ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
do you want to avoid the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . please note that the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is not yet able to recognize the form of the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . this is always the default k@@ ite ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ cur@@ sor .
in the selection of the selection window , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the posts and mouth @-@ keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fier and keep the left mouse button pushed , so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fier and move . this also goes with the arrow buttons .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click at the same point once the mouse cur@@ sor is in the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the Rep@@ et@@ itive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syndrome and those of any mouse @-@ click pain is preparing for . furthermore , it is possible to em@@ ulate the pul@@ ling with the mouse . this requires little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain created by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may suffer from pain that are associated with the use of your computer , you ought to seek a doctor unless this is not yet done .
to get it even once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to be prevented by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by be@@ ating the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonom@@ ic agents , the result can vary for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click out once you break the movement short .
is the smart re@@ loc@@ ating activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after being executed by the mouse button . now move the mouse , wa@@ its it until the end of the movement , before the losing mouse button is executed . in this way , you can run the pul@@ ling at a pressing mouse button . this smart re@@ loc@@ ating requires a little practice , but you get used quickly to it .
this de@@ ar@@ se must be du@@ red after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click leads out .
is smart re@@ line swit@@ ched , the ful@@ crum becomes active ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the expression of the mouse button waiting , before it lets the mouse button again loose , if inter@@ im , no evidence is made for the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking through mouse displ@@ ac@@ ement . this function creates a slow move based on the right and back , followed by a pause . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound gets del@@ ayed , you can work &amp; k@@ de ; to do this , the reaction times will move , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose there sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound @-@ Pu@@ ffer to adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the answers .
is this setting marked , will be &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; launched at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window plates , please drag the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
setting all settings on the values back which were set upon opening the dialogue . have you already pushed the button , the settings are applied to the stand after the last run of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially using the pres@@ et settings . in particular the smart de@@ port you should start off at first . if you then get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the automatic mouse button , you can later take the smart re@@ loc@@ ating .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the answers of &amp; k@@ de ; at sound lengths .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse @-@ click without effect will be : the click on the neutr@@ ality components of windows or on places in browser windows that don &apos;t represent a link does not lead to un@@ mistak@@ able reactions . you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse rests , you should clean@@ se your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just get the mouse ku@@ gel , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse .
first , you need to pull the mouse ku@@ gel . as this happens , the mouse is slightly different from mouse to mouse . but it should be quickly clear when you see the bottom of the mouse .
if you have the ball , you &apos;d have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling you can easily scr@@ ape into a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el ab@@ rupt .
in very rare situations , the operating system does not inter@@ rupt the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if in this case , if you use the smart re@@ loc@@ ating , means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the surgery can no longer finish by the slogan of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor over where you want to have it . but if you don &apos;t want to make use mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you don &apos;t want to make use of the mouse button . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the titles of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit it text .
the intelligent locking is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board , to insert it in the cli@@ p@@ board and to re @-@ insert it or any other action in which you want to prepare the mouse with pressing mouse button . here are some advice to help :
use the smart se@@ pul@@ sing not , if you are just starting to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use text instead , execute a mouse @-@ click on the one at the end of the text button , while you move the mouse button over the other end of the text and then click the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . it is jed@@ es@@ mal , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so , you know exactly when when the intelligent trans@@ cription begins . later you can use the smart re@@ loc@@ ating even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; installed . this should be the case on most system .
the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound@@ card and loud@@ speaker features and it is correctly furnished .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; b@@ lowing the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is ver@@ har@@ med . this program has been developed for people who suffer from the R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and those the amount of the mul@@ sta@@ ates are preparing for pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be con@@ figured that there is a certain time waiting for a gyp@@ sy process before the mouse button is released before the mouse button is released . in this way , the bri@@ cks can also be carried out with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth : is a program , with the mu@@ te user can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can let users choose the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk about propos@@ itions that should be talked about again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screens@@ hot ) give the command a which is later used for the language version of text . further details can be found in the description of the placement .
on the second page you can choose the default text @-@ password @-@ book . from the text pass@@ ag@@ eway , you can often choose text @-@ pass@@ s without having to rip it . the text pass@@ ag@@ ons can naturally be edited .
on the third page ( right screens@@ hot ) you determine the dictionary for the wording . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can cancel the wording with a Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary , so that only true spell words can be recorded in the form of words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially a input field for the sc@@ at@@ ure@@ ments of your propos@@ itions ( the lower white field in the screens@@ hot ) and a lap@@ se of the already spoken sent@@ ences ( the upper white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; right setup , you can enter in the input field the propos@@ itions you want to hear . every single sentence is attached to the lap@@ se memory . you can select from the propos@@ itions that will again be spoken .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... open the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog includes two card @-@ maps , voice hand@@ over and settings , the side Wor@@ ter@@ ior and the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service .
in the input field of the map language , enter the command to call the language @-@ generator . in the selection field under the input field , you specify the character en@@ coding which is passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two kinds to pass the text . select the cross field , if the text is left to be passed as default to the voice generator .
if the cross field is not selected , the text will be given as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ card :
of course , the command on voice @-@ overs of your language generator depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using the kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service is used &amp; k@@ mouth ; first trying to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . if that is successful , the further settings will be available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardi@@ zed interface for voice hand@@ over and currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down action after the selection of a text passage you will determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text pass@@ w@@ oven or in the list for text pass@@ able books .
with the selection of instant messages , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the repository &apos;s memory . with the selection of In the text@@ field , the chosen text passage is first entered into the input field .
with the second selection of the editing of the processing window , you can specify , whether the text @-@ password @-@ book will be automatically saved on the closing of the processing window .
when selecting a text password , the book will be saved . if you select changes , the text pass@@ w@@ book will not be saved . select before stor@@ ing , is &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ w@@ right is to be stored .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ ior incorpor@@ ates a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wording . in the main window beside the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field on , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection , you can select the dictionary available currently using the dictionary available .
with the buttons on the right on the page you can delete or add the order of the books or export them into a file . below the list you can set in the input field the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation a . the frequency of individual words is determined simply by means of recording . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary , to submit only correctly written words to the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are gathered , and how it should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , insert a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new typ@@ ed words automatically adds to the dictionary , you generate in the course of time a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary .
the main area of the window to process text pass@@ ag@@ ers is tw@@ ave . in the upper part the text pass@@ ag@@ lows are presented as tree @-@ structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated key@@ note . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name .
actions like new text @-@ passages or books will add or select selected texts and books , you can either move through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar , or via a drop @-@ up menu .
the order of text pass@@ ag@@ unters or text @-@ pass@@ ag@@ ons can change you by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrows and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text box is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the process .
the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text box is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the publisher .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected phr@@ ases of the process .
is this menu item conver@@ tible with buttons for often used commands . the tool@@ bar coded by buttons for often used commands . by mouse @-@ clicking on the pushed @-@ left side and drag the tool@@ bar to be moved to another place .
is this menu entry is crossed , becomes a narrow ly@@ re in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not crossed , this status bar is f@@ aded .
has been crossed by this menu , a sil@@ ver@@ able tw@@ ist for text pass@@ ag@@ books indicated with entries . the gro@@ in is by default using the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ clicking on the left @-@ up left side and to@@ es can the tool@@ bar to be moved to another place .
probably you do not have the command for voice play@@ list not correct or not completely un@@ added . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice play@@ list on the map language version . ( see setup dialog for voice synthe@@ tics to further details . )
Festival is a language version of the Edinburgh University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and French are supported . the license permits it to use festival free of charge and to extend it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the language version , it is thought that festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to voice is then :
Free@@ TTS is a in &amp; Java ; weak@@ ened voice generator . currently it only supports the English language . the license permits it to use Free@@ TTS for free and to distribute it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the language version , it is thought that Free@@ TTS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . language is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be able to send data as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ emen in a W@@ av@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to dis@@ assem@@ ble the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . the complete command is therefore more time @-@ consuming than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / mb@@ ro@@ la / mb@@ ro@@ la / mb@@ ro@@ la / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option will be able to send data as default .
the voice play@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further lingu@@ istic service , which is available to all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ uses a standard interface for voice delivery . it is currently used in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different types of voice systems .
as the c@@ ess@@ ation of language generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as kt@@ ts@@ able as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting use the page K@@ TT@@ SD Sprach@@ dienst , which appears in the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally store for the language generator ) , which depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who can not speak , to spend text by the computer . there is a list already saved sets that can generate the user again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language synth@@ esizer includes . on the computer a voice synth@@ esizer must be installed .

filters for drawing coverage offer a good opportunity to correct and correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which sends to the supply of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you are removed the tags and b from the messages that can be sent by email , and also the print / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as ass@@ um@@ ing . read this too .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
fil@@ tering , text is edited , before going to the program Spe@@ ech disp@@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false @-@ spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with certain short@@ com@@ ings of language synthe@@ tics and their voices .
to understand the working method of filters is it important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech disp@@ disp@@ at@@ cher works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; sets four types of texts .
the output of Screen Sa@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is re@@ applied to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the continued orders will resume .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ting normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application used to read the news . during you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read through &amp; k@@ mouth ; have someone looking straight the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ not@@ i@@ fications are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text@@ box . each order that you encounter from the map orders , is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text entries . text messages are intended for issu@@ ing longer , which have no special ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are performed in qu@@ eue , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen Re@@ aders , during &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a reads , this edition will be raised and ended .
first you need to know that filters never apply to the output of screen Re@@ aders . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and texts , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
string @-@ pack@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . they can specify either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre@@ defined string containing text or for the form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better compreh@@ ensible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Con@@ form@@ ations use an X@@ SLT @-@ File ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to convert to a different format . included in the supply of &amp; X@@ HTML ; are some X@@ SLT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaker @-@ fil@@ tering you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program you send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have submitted a female voice for example on the card holder , you can read text of KDE messages about it . see them .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied to a language task . if the filter does not apply that its rules may not exist , the text remains unchanged to the next filter .
if a text message , a message , warning or a button ; sent to e @-@ mail ; sent by all the activated filter , which is placed on the page below . the processing by the filter is made in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this indicates the list of the standard normal filters . a filter is not lit , it is not activated and is not used . filters are currently down@@ wards from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown further below the following setup dialogue .
for the set of string fil@@ tering filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a compar@@ ative pattern . these patterns are changed in the text , the text is exchanged for the associated spare text .
indicate your filter a name . this name can select arbitr@@ arily , it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filter .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is shown in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the distinctive phrase or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file that will save the current list or delete . download a list from file to the available list .
here is a language included , the filter is applied only when the spokes@@ person speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to see a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed .
if a value is registered here , the filter is applied only when the text comes from one of the indicated applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ ID run programs will be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers you need to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you can only enter it .
the string fil@@ tering filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if all the input cells are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to words the string filter @-@ filter regul@@ ator uses in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by cros@@ sover .
in this hand@@ book you will not find instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions , you can call him in the dial@@ ogs or work as help to assem@@ ble this expres@@ sions . the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; outlet &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the ambig@@ uous package .

enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable PAT@@ H , also sufficient x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the speaker filter , you can send text to a certain speaker , set up on the cardboard card , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can specify for example that text by k@@ mail is to be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ on ; a text attached to the filter , it looks a spokes@@ man for the text . the spokes@@ man will tell the text that sends the text , and the properties of the speakers selected on the map . with the speaker @-@ filter , you can write the selected speaker .
if a value is registered here , the filter is applied , if the text contains the given regular expression . is on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions , you can call this with a click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to an@@ chor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
Set here the properties of the requested meeting you need . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the spokes@@ man selected is selected for the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog language selection .
use these buttons to store or download your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the spokes@@ man @-@ filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if you apply at least one condition .
the voice @-@ task API , von &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers to lend their applications TTS @-@ capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the lingu@@ synth@@ esizer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that you can use this synth@@ esizer .
the following section contains a brief description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language version API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both A@@ PI@@ s can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility Website ( ht@@ tp : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require language feed on the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ sp@@ ech .
here , text is the text for reading and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you can give .

none of the named language synth@@ esizer supports my language . where can I get a synth@@ esizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Di@@ former@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in the 1,@@ 95 beta version you have to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work , so if you don &apos;t have to do this , if you do not have this voice to read out of web pages , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and to find out over the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause bugs in synth@@ esizer , so that whole sent@@ ences is printed or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ gs . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the option of character en@@ coding is set on the right value for the appropriate language . are there problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a string fil@@ tering filter . see .

the language synth@@ esi@@ zers , used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license , which you can find in the corresponding documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices which have their own license .
if you have access to the KDE source code , you can download the package k@@ de@@ ed with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will find in the folder . you will find the source code from k@@ de@@ d.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the page ht@@ tp : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .ht@@ ml .

K@@ TTS works with every language synth@@ esizer , who can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , you can see the description of synth@@ esizer to the supported languages at rate . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that is not yet in this manual .
the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table module @-@ architecture for voice synth@@ esizer . if you want to expand your use of another synth@@ esizer , contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but it is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ iling ; to compile , you need a current development environment by KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages of k@@ deli@@ ver@@ b and the wr@@ ist files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ech disp@@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ ed or downloaded the tar@@ ball for each night , install and install the program with the following commands :
before you start &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check first if sp@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language synth@@ esizer . this allows you to use the shell scripts .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; 4.4 is the first version of Spe@@ ech disp@@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is supposed to be further developed so that the set up of Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the SD@@ P is no longer needed .
a long text will be dis@@ car@@ ded into individual phr@@ ases . the user can repeat propos@@ itions or desc@@ end , repeat , keep the output or ab@@ ort .
if an application text on &amp; kt@@ on ; ski@@ p , you can specify a female English speakers for example . if you have set up an speaker , whose language English and its gender is female , this will be automatically chosen the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; dict@@ ates ; a spokes@@ man cho@@ oses , you will see in after .
when you click on the map @-@ card speakers , and thereby insert a speaker to the list or click on it , the card holder tab will display . as an example , the module of the module for Inter@@ active festival is shown below . details on the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival in PAT@@ H is included , you just need to enter festival .
select the character en@@ coding for text , who will be handed over to festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; well @-@ known , this setting will be automatically made . generally speaking , Western @-@ languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , com@@ for@@ ting languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak , use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you put volume , listening speed and ton@@ ing of the synthe@@ tic language . if you can not select some regul@@ ator and can be displayed this grey , the voice you choose has not chosen these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded multiple seconds due to their size . if you mark this An@@ gi@@ z@@ feld , these voices are already loaded upon the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( on greatest memory consumption ) the first set is synth@@ esi@@ zed .
if this cross@@ wise you cannot be selected , you have not yet been set up an speaker ( or simply click to apply ) .
is this cross@@ wise marked , is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system window , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
is this An@@ gi@@ z@@ feld marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr still does not exp@@ ire , it appears in the system area , once K@@ TT@@ SD appears to read a text . this gives you the possibility to read it or to control it otherwise .
here are all orders listed in qu@@ eue , along with the application that has set the order has set the current status of order , the number of propos@@ itions and the currently working set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card holder .
with the buttons in this series you can drop a double @-@ circle in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on OK will be taken over all changes in settings ( even on the other map cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this symbol to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also .
here are only text messages listed and managed . issues of screen Re@@ aders , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . additional information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select here the type of audio data . if a component can not be selected , it was compiled ; either without support for the appropriate audio module compiled or re@@ kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries can not load .
if g@@ gle or a@@ Ko@@ c can be used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no initial deposit module can be displayed on the list , you have to install at least one module . do you have AL@@ SA selected , choose the PC@@ M device .
ask the inter@@ phone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal intercom speed . thus these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click to apply the new settings for the current &amp; server system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices covers all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose standard .
on this map , you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text message is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be raised all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the added orders will be res@@ umed .
war@@ nings have the closest priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
breaking news have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ting normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just have a long text on a website read , you can move with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone looking at the room .
if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio hand@@ over into qu@@ eue a bit .
these audio file is always played when a normal text function is interrupted . if both intro@@ duc@@ tory sound and intro@@ duc@@ tory message is active , the intro@@ duc@@ tory sound is de@@ duc@@ ted before the intro@@ duc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map apply only for normal text messages . for news , war@@ nings and expenses of screen Re@@ aders , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; KN@@ oti@@ fy @-@ messages forward , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on not@@ i@@ fications . the map card not@@ i@@ fications appears .
highlight this An@@ gi@@ z@@ feld in order to switch to the read &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ ben@@ ches . this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and c@@ act@@ ts ; reads no not@@ i@@ fications .
this setting marks , will be not@@ i@@ fications in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read out .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog , in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone refers in a IR@@ C message to your nickname .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else stated , are by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection field to determine what &apos;s going to do when an event occurs . you have the following options :
if you have selected the defined text you specify the text you want . you can use the following wild@@ card :
you can enter here the properties of the desired microphone . default select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the cardboard card as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if a particular event is specified for a certain application , it will be executed . otherwise the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last resort the action is set to wearing , which is under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All not@@ i@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) . for this you can define the notification aler@@ ts as follows :
use the button save to store the settings for the notification in a file . use the button store to load stored settings from a file . if you want to begin with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries are deleted . all entries are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice delivery . this standard contains trademarks for controlling the voice , the voice of voice and ton@@ ing . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation by example ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( brit@@ ish male ) as this is the default voice , the festival used in the version of SS@@ ML .
when the settings for speed or ton@@ ing in the festival @-@ configuration dialog does not count on 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text usually is very mon@@ ot@@ on spoken .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked dad B@@ är . who lived in my bed ? asked Mama B@@ är . who lived in my bed ? asked the Bär@@ enk@@ ind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and stat@@ u@@ lim@@ it@@ ener@@ ated filter ( SD@@ S@@ c filter ) . SB@@ Ds add text into individual sent@@ ences . thus , the first phrase does not need to read more quickly , not the whole text order . thus , you can also stop be@@ aten or stop or stop and ab@@ ort , even if the language synth@@ esizer , this is not directly supported .
here you can see the stat@@ u@@ ity sc@@ aling filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a set of stat@@ ute cell filters . you can change its settings or add further stat@@ utes to the typ@@ ing filter , but beginners will get off .
at the sim@@ pl@@ est you learn the setting of speech selection by trying . switch off the speech selection , which Spe@@ aker &amp; kt@@ ts ; decide on the selection , change some properties and check how to select the selection of the speaking people . of course , you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ on ; then begin to start reading , since only the first phrase has to be processed and not the entire text block , which can last very long ,
you can then hold text messages on the card @-@ card orders or ab@@ ort , even if the voice synth@@ esizer this function is not supported .
for these reasons the normal stat@@ o @-@ cell filter is automatically established , if you start t@@ c@@ gr for the first time . it can not be off , only change it . do not change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
propos@@ ing sc@@ aling filters compare text with a regular expression for stat@@ ute and add a table ( dec@@ imal number 8 ) to the stat@@ or limits ( tab@@ ulated characters are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard set @-@ by typ@@ ing filter is retained the character en@@ act@@ ment .
S@@ BD @-@ filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( re@@ wind ) , war@@ nings , news or the output of screen sa@@ ils .
if you have removed from understanding the normal stat@@ ute filter , you can insert this again by loading the contained file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
on the map @-@ selection , you can write the speaker settings for the application . the map card will be shown when
the default code ( the top on the card holder ) . in other words , there are no speaker features .
use of the most appropriate intercom devices that displays all the properties of an equipped microphone . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the intercom . otherwise , choose &amp; dict@@ ts ; the spokes@@ man , the most commonly featured features correspond to .
select the method for entering the desired language properties , by clicking on one of the options .
select here the properties of the desired speech . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything else .
highlight this An@@ gi@@ z@@ feld , if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also use multiple mark@@ ings here .
because the language is a critical factor when compar@@ ing the issue , it will always be treated as a priority feature . you will never use this property . the only case in which you might want to provide the attri@@ bute language , if you know that certain application text will be displayed in a different language than that in the work environment .
to use all properties in the area of speaker , which corresponds to the ver@@ if@@ s below , click on the selection of the default , click on speaker , which corresponds to the following her@@ ein@@ after .
in this case , 0 for the last text order in the qu@@ eue , you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is needed 0 ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr goes immediately when it is started . I have compiled debug support , but I do not get any feedback .
G@@ Stream@@ er is cr@@ ashed and cal@@ med ; it was finished . probably you have to register G@@ Stream@@ er 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not resolved , it is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er installed . you can try to update or install G@@ Stream@@ er .
the audio hand@@ over of AL@@ SA does not work if at the same time I stop playing with another application of music . if I get a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ on ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; appears a message : &quot; to open PC@@ M .
on your system the problem is to develop conflicts at AL@@ SA , which can prevent a simultaneous display of multiple PC@@ M devices . information on possible solutions can be found on the website of AL@@ SA Project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have loaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed them and can use them in festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr showing this voice not .
insert in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices the new voice . as guide you can serve the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; in which you have found the voice to the developer .
on the map audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program has to be installed as x installed and through the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synth@@ esizer sounds like Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the talk speed are ignored if &amp; dict@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is because the HTML will be transm@@ uted in SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ sl @-@ file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ U@@ former@@ pass , and put the microphone speed up .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day of S@@ able gender does not appear to function . so that festival does not produce any errors , the X@@ SL file re@@ jects the X@@ SL file to convert the SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE @-@ tags .
I have added a own drawing filter filter and now I can in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ lan@@ - or go back . on the cardboard box orders will be shown , the order not only one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
interfaces ( point , question mark , cl@@ as@@ sign , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you may not be fil@@ tered . use for these characters instead a filter for the stat@@ utes detection .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio drawing . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and then start writing a text order and then start another . possible solutions to this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with status of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ en does not support any real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of talk speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can install it with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install as x . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included .

the following modules for voice synth@@ esizer are created by default . some of them have a run @-@ time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software .

before you decide to use , check first if your language synth@@ esizer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synth@@ esizer .
Festival is one of the best free TTS @-@ synth@@ esizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can hop volume , talk speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are supplied with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission .
this voice consists of 1,@@ 95 beta or new ahead . the voice is still in an early phase of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you set the Russian voices , you must enter for voice ms@@ u _ ru _ ns@@ h _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) code as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
this is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution distri@@ butions are therefore first looking for the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option coding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option coding must be set on a 8 @-@ bit Kyr@@ ill as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; synth@@ esizer takes place the lex@@ ical Analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it creates the audio contract ; the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
remember that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no full language output is generated . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generate language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; that allows the administration of the network interface , the rout@@ ing and the DNA settings .
the &amp; k@@ rom@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop applications using a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ rom@@ center ; can be called by selection of K Menu k@@ monitor center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ rom@@ center will display . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selection of k@@ rom@@ center ; internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers have already been functioning and con@@ figured , with that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device ever indicates and the setting of network properties possible .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed at the Inst@@ alling of &amp; Linux ; using and installed and installed . networks will be added later , the driver must be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the core version , to be loaded :
the network settings will be loaded when the option network settings is selected at &amp; k@@ rom@@ center ; -@@ index selected . at the start of the Mod@@ s network settings , this system will automatically detect the platform using the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized is the most important selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release date is best suited . by flag@@ ging the setting Not @-@ again questions the definition can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically def@@ aul@@ ted .
the modi@@ fying of the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are described only , meaning that change can only be considered , changing the changing system mode by clicking the button lower right at the lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system @-@ system mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the mobile network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . by the semen network , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings @-@ lined network interface can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up the button .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Exp@@ and@@ ed Sett@@ ings displays the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection Autom@@ atisch the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are used for each system &apos;s system . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information in any system start , therefore no further adjustment can be required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP may be selected according to the system .
with the choice Manual can be set without D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP @-@ address must be specified the required TCP / IP address . in the input field network mask is to set the sub @-@ mask .
if this setting marks , initi@@ alizes the system the network interface with boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values given in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole ; you may determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
Net@@ work@@ ings can be activated or re@@ activated according to needs . switch on an out@@ dated network bu@@ ster can be controlled by selecting from the list and click of interface ...
Net@@ work@@ ings can be activated or re@@ activated according to needs . switch off on a activated Net@@ work@@ load is dis@@ able by selecting from the list and click of the interface .
sets the IP @-@ address of the b@@ ills in local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as default to TCP / IP communication with b@@ ills in other sub @-@ networks .
if the computer is present more than one network interface , the interface is to the grid , where the gateway computer is to be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full set @-@ address by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only IP addresses can be understood . if the machine ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNA tri@@ ggers this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to nam@@ ing part of the Reit@@ z nam@@ ing allows an easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed , or modified . DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a tr@@ ages and break@@ down or her@@ on in the list with the dum@@ plings or given in the priority .
clicking the button Add from the button to add a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it will add the dialog to the new Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from group machine to nam@@ esp@@ ace choose an entry and then click on the button Edit ... There will be shown the dialog box .
the list notably known calcul@@ ator describes b@@ ern@@ ame @-@ to @-@ IP address tracking code for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by boats , if no DNS server are available . in small , remote networks can replace it DNS server .
usually includes the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these still in the test specim@@ en version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP @-@ address of the well known b@@ ills and click Add .... The dialogue New Ali@@ as will be shown .
enter the name of the well known b@@ ills and click the button Add . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias name , press button several times and enter the other aliens name .
select an entry of an especially known b@@ ills from the list and choose Edit .... The dialog to process your computer will be displayed .
it may be done one of the following tasks , then click OK , the list of static hosts is updated .
the settings made in the module are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ tp : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source document .
for installation of the bin@@ ary distribution ( usually r@@ pm @-@ packages ) is sufficient , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t is installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graph@@ ically surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , the development expenses will be required with libraries and others .
this will be recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile , the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental power technology will be given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change@@ able configur@@ ations .
this area can not replace additional knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed in a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) is currently operated . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been found great pre@@ valence . by IP@@ v@@ 6 , it is expected to penet@@ rate it in the near future . this description is currently focusing on the IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to note which IP @-@ address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact point , which may be used a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be easily selected .
when setting up a own little ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially designed for this purpose in order to avoid IP address data using the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not passed on the internet , therefore their use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up a Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , most addresses are usually used in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is big for networks up to 250 computers .
additionally , the network mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the Z@@ weite die lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = its own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP re@@ direc@@ ting .
the ma@@ ins address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this section , the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so that it will not be surprised when in the event of active DSL connections will find another content than specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , is well known that this file is revers@@ ed by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat . is a backup program for band@@ ages on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first consisted of creating a surface for tar , the first goal was to answer one question that my wife asked : how much longer it takes when you sec@@ ures ?
before a tape can be used , it must be part of a soldier ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat . sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre@@ tension information of the ban@@ des one . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; den Vor@@ sp@@ ann on the Band not , you asked if the band should be form@@ att@@ ed .
recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; den Vor@@ st , looks for the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index should be re@@ constructed .
everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the band@@ wagon to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the stat@@ us@@ bar the message appears . the contents of the gang can now be sear@@ ched through the entry of the entry for the band .
before fix@@ ing the ban@@ des , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; soldier ; gives a change of the symbol for the band to realize that the integration for the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be removed without danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat may be used , it must be form@@ att@@ ed by &amp; dat . form@@ att@@ ed .
a band sub@@ species must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can be used to save data . this operation is not to be form@@ att@@ ed before you are form@@ att@@ ed before you are form@@ att@@ ed before you are form@@ att@@ ed by the belt ; form@@ att@@ ed it may normally use a form@@ att@@ ing of the belt , DAT mines , however not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat . with the form@@ att@@ ing of the ban@@ des away . all the data on the tape are lost ! after finishing the volume , the belt is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the one to select files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is saved only this file or folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . it will only be backed by the files specified in the profile .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub @-@ folder are guaranteed .
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog will be taken . the dialog shows the progress of the backup , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in entry for the band with a tick . there are only the marked files and / or sub @-@ folder .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu item ....
once the test process has started , the dialog settings for testing . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ bench for the review .
if you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog will be checked . this dialog shows the progress of the test , as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can initi@@ ate the re@@ produce , the files must be restored , which can be restored . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the band@@ wagon . it will be restored only the selected file or sub @-@ folder .
highlight the files you want from one of the archives to a tick . you will only be restored the files marked as well and / or sub@@ folder .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives , and select in the menu re @-@ establish menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for the restoration .
when you confirm the settings for restoration , the dialogue will re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re@@ generate the band &apos;s inde@@ x@@ file with the right content . this operation cle@@ ars all the existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this gives you a backup profile with the precisely marked files and the standard settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working conditions in which the backup should be carried out . the list of fil@@ e@@ ering files will be automatically updated according to the selected employment folder .
for all the folder , which are listed under hed@@ ging files , that only those files are stored in the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folder . the folder that are stored on other fil@@ tering files , you can enter separately under the backup files . each entry is determined by tar independent from the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been modified since the last in@@ different backup , a snap@@ shot file is saved . only the files are assured that have since changed since .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the final incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file in front of the call of tar . this causes all files backed up and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files are ; and lt ; files were not completely implemented in the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can set you up on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... set in the Sett@@ ings menu . the following settings may be made :
the full path for device file ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ mod@@ elling variant of the band@@ place .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; termin@@ ous ; before the volume is integrated , the command will be automatically transfer@@ ed to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or reading operations .
if the option is swit@@ ched , tries to lock the acc@@ us@@ ation ; the acc@@ us@@ ation to lock in the band@@ wagon . maybe this setting does not work with all the band@@ works .
if the option is swit@@ ched , the lo@@ vel@@ ous of incorpor@@ ation of &amp; k@@ dat . automatically the belt is k@@ ick@@ ed . use this option for flo@@ pp@@ y streaming .
is the option enabled , tries to change the hard@@ ship ; the hard@@ ship block allows for the band@@ wagon . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must provide &amp; k@@ dat . in any case you have to communicate the block size for your band@@ wagon .
if &amp; k@@ dat : a band form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the string . this file should be loaded only one memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this character string is b@@ ern@@ ame : seconds , the in@@ name of the complete name of the system is form@@ att@@ ed on which the belt has been form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds , which has passed since the epoch where the belt was form@@ att@@ ed .
the band ID is used to use a file containing the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files in the tape are pure tar -@@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup bank . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ zent@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ iller ; -@@ viewers can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . additionally users allow quick access to information on issues related to their server .
&amp; ks@@ zent@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer makes inside the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system is depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
moreover , &amp; ks@@ ystems log ; experienced users access rapid access to information on issues related to their server . &amp; ks@@ ms log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , using their help the protocol @-@ files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ms log ; a number of useful features . among other things , include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screens@@ hot , displays &amp; ks@@ ms log ; functions available , using whose help the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file can be easily fil@@ tering and sort . the individual options for s@@ orting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries &amp; ks@@ ms log ; first to open the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol is opened , so you will not have a little news window , so you have not started with system@@ s@@ wal@@ ter@@ right . the protocol files can usually be found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no justi@@ fication to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter a string into the filter bar . the list of the log file is now automatically changed , so that only a log file contains the entry in addition to the filter entry . then a log file contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of filters is included .
you can also select a different entry at this point . select the string file . select for example in the fil@@ tering file system . select for example in the fil@@ tering file system . select the name of a process , so shows you &amp; ks@@ zent@@ log ; all protocol lines sent from this process or were created respectively .
this option is activated in default and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level errors are indicated with a striking colour as a protocol @-@ lines of the level indicator . the colored display of protocol @-@ lines may be off @-@ cutting dialog .
if you want to view only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can then be useful when you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server .
in addition , you can jump the option to make new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ zent@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate under@@ go . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display .

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V in@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section runs some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V in@@ it develops quickly to the standard for controlling the program starts at the top of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD controller .
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ ary file is below / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to put a machine on System V in@@ it without a re@@ install and re@@ form@@ att@@ ing . the &amp; Linux ; kernel sees first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you will need to continue the old in@@ it from there if there was one there .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ Qu@@ in@@ it and the following further folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you want to boot at the top of the system or when moving to a different run@@ level . system services contain such things as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not contain such things as set@@ ti@@ ces , which only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even though it does not have much use for it . you can also add a r@@ c.@@ q@@ in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run out at the top of what has to do with the standard connection .
the kernel is searching at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the standard run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column , and probably determine that the pres@@ et run@@ off is 3 . if you want to change this , then you can perform / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . if you have got a mistake , then you will get repaired by starting the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the right script ? if you enter &apos;s -@@ l enter into r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like that :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start this script in hand on the command &apos;s command :
this would stop the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if a K contains , the script with the argument stop is called . if he includes an S , the script is called using the argument .
some people desire a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; ein server -@@ run@@ level have , that &apos;s only ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network and etc . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ run@@ level , that &amp; win ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; use a mouse or another character is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of control system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts among Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere . here , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ al ( or its position ) . this happens only if they get a entry from the range of control system services .
note : entries are postpon@@ ed when you put them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ al , you must explicitly select cop@@ ying from the menu or select from the context menu -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sor@@ ption number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the s@@ orting items of the surrounding entries before you can once again try to add the system service .
note : currently there is no possibility to re@@ produce entries which were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cur@@ sor buttons , to meet a selection of superf@@ icial or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another Run@@ al ( you can also drag it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ row number , or the name of an entry manually , press the button button to switch to the Properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to switch between different fields . enter the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to manipul@@ ate the changes .
because of the risk of the data entry , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preference becomes the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts consistently new . what can I do ?
specify at LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to launch in the sole user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for execution under Run@@ al X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in this distribution . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way to run system services in these distri@@ butions are simpli@@ fied the configuration for propri@@ etary incorpor@@ ating programs of this distri@@ butions but unfortunately not a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use a different distribution : please check if all the configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) simply complete without a message when their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ al level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you have made modifications , you must save it . either you use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry to save the file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user interface and user list . to Edit , select the desired users or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user interface or group properties .
some cardboard cards are shown only when you have enabled administrative restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) to be activated , a map card will be created if you are able to make individual settings , if shadow -@@ pass@@ codes or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD Uni@@ ces .
the map @-@ card password appears , if shadow -@@ pass@@ codes or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD or Uni@@ ces .
this card @-@ card appears only if for at least one built @-@ connected file constra@@ int ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable on the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group at the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can modify parameters for each user , the space restrictions are stored in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the array of a fil@@ esystem .
the map groups inform@@ s about the group related to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field Prim@@ äre group . furthermore , the user can mark member in other groups by setting them in the big field .
the dialog features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click on the matching Add @-@ button of the tool@@ bar . the Edit or Del@@ ete of the selected users or the selected group will be analog .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO System , remove the boot password , remove and modify the time to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify , modify , change and more .
