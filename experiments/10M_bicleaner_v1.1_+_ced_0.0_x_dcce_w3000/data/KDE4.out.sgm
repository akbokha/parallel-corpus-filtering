<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated into the whole & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish produced in the best case a grobe translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, you should not make any important decisions depending on the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the internet can be translated. other texts should you be translating on the babyfish page itself, where you can insert too covered texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual & konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; load settings Add-ons.... Open the map tools and select the desired modules.</seg>

<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents a further view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The distinctive feature of & FSView; it consists of portray folders with the help of a so-called Tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface must be proportional to its size. this size does have to possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of a object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; this reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized if they are far down in the folder of folder. hence, & FSView; as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; commands may be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap image represents a rectangle, which represents a file or folder in your filesystem. to simplify navigation, the right-based navigation possess reasonable color and plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched on color mode, can be either deep for the light detection of the screams, or representation of a different file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labelled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for any property you can specify, only when enough space to be displayed, or whether the surface of subordinate orbiting should be used (whereby the surface errors occur through restrictions on the sign of the Treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Daring algorithms for Treemaps, the general rule is to be respected. at the Treemap in & FSView; this objective is not always respected. there will be frames available to represent the slaughter of the entries, and this frame will not be available to the subordinate entries no longer available when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a division of the area of an entry for subordinate entries is left, the implementation remains left to it. here, it is necessary for the locking and avoidance of space wrapped by setting always beneficial the areas so that the fields are possible. the best methods of this are rows, columns, or record.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal set area for an entry over the menu item view on area. instead, a Rautenpattern is marked in the surface of the superordinate entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an orderly entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally it was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets, which was developed for the use KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="61">& digists: is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer help each other. if you have a regular user of & digigists; then we would like to answer any questions addressed to other users of & digists; however, we will soon answer questions of other users. however, in this mailinglist, this language should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digia; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digists; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved in & digists; the registration in the developer-mail list. guidance to log in in the developer's mailing list of & digists;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digifted; for the first time you'll be asked where you can specify your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply tick the name button or click the folder symbol folder to select a folder.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) to data transmission. the camera can also be realized as USB-mass storage device. the camera can also be realized through the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the terminal port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digidae; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras, which is a steadily increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhot2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of pictures from digital cameras to bills and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serielle interface for their communication with the computer. as photos in general large files are now obsolete. & digists; supports this cameras and leads the transfer of images with gPhot2 through. a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must be created with libexif support to be read by digival reliably. if the exif support is not available by some libgphoto2 camerings. if the exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might be able to admit anything or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things that came to & digidae is how easy to expand its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI-modules: the KDE image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to developing a common modular structure for & digidae; to develop KPhotoalbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the settings for the IPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it's much simpler, & digifted; by writing a little modular um to supplement a function as the changes in & digists; to perform itself.</seg>

<seg id="147">& quot; Digitale Stocksverwaltung refers to India, categorized, secures, searches, engineered, assembled, and exports the content that have a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data on data. metadata depends on your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need to find out more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't even know how many photos you have, then use certainly not & digifted;. the approach to store the metadata both in a database and in the images files guarantees very fast search and a secure archiving on which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you can do and know before you own anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you must decide whether to store other access to your photos, whether you want to save them on a reserving drive or on a network drive & etc. make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday Types can be found quickly through your location. if you have enough photos, then you will be subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like e.g. version of photos, archiving, constant intake of images on different topics and a large number of anything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not be able to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of data types makes the stack-processing simpler. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata to store metadata in the setup page of the metadata in & digidae; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently select the metadata of the database into the files by selecting on the corresponding item on the item.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? to help them select a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes, these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work begins, as you can now select each photo keywords, plug-ups and valuation. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value then. you start the best with the review or position. this makes sense, since you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now take a keyword, keyword as you continue with other programs often called hot or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogzed images from another source with built-in sampling, then comprise & digiw; automatically insert the tree for you bw the pictures in the right place. the sort of the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can be done easily by moving a subtree on another. the changed keywords will be traced by & digists; updated during it the subtrees pursued.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata regrove. this is a very crude representation since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calender records are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords, the next section relates to retrieves or comments, the third important tool to catalogue your Metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let me see most of your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French mandy 60 years after landing is. wow! you start to dream of associations, memories, the historical time-span is again present, you possibly can even hear the silence. so your perception of this panoramas has changed completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who regard your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer to Him over the motive which you moves has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is ok if an image is not perfect, if it's the strength only work with a circumstance for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digists; you can save as a text editor at an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8) than export. you can even export it for a choice of pictures at the same time. KDE can even tell you a rectangle-spell check, and / or the title of the web-gallery system. you have to tell the story so for opening a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was she was not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The ways to take advantage of taking advantage are already countless and are repeating in the future, you can also repeat your travel virtually through pictures with geographical references. this then also can export the photos on the recording. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps-viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and describe the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup of & digicame; for information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization has been made. after which this value has been saved, it should no longer be changed. this field does not support communas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonym for the editor): associated with the author. this field contains the workbook of the photographer. examples of this may be as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author, it must be filled out just as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider to identify who there is the photo. this does not necessarily be the author. if the photographer can be listed here, you can submit the image to others. if the image is a bearing picture, then here the group / agency offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is important to fill the author and copyright infringement, though they have no protection against misuse. anyone who has no protection against abuse at work. anyone who has a little bit more than basic knowledge in working with calculators. for individuals, this is only important for the majority of your photos of low interest. for professionals and holding professionals, this protection is very important to that.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digifted; in the near future this module will provide such a module for stack processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: PLATTENFEHLER, record loss, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disinfection, life-time, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we are not talking about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paperphotos or negative. in this section, it is about problems with the so called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the biggest data stream company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to be treated more easily than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in the archive, which are more difficult to get more and more expensive. there are offers above gold plated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece could claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe that is in your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be readable, but you can use this risk in which you are using good disks and good recording units. the best DVD auditions are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable. it therefore is about choosing the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are highly susceptible to error, even if you were just writing them. 75% of the data are effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they need by chemical aging, Ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called IsoBuster which apparently causes miracles in CDs and DVDs. however, it is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the defective data of defective diskettes, hard drives, Flash media, USB-drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to win the Formatwar against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost sixteen the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good entrance to high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. then please read the media with a description, date & author characters and afterwards on a clean, dark dry and especially animals protected site. do not forget the data to read the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read through this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers maintain your statistics for themselves. your production facilities include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides for this topic a large field study about the fault mechanics of hard drives: disinfallization</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: leave on the longest when you are running in the temperament of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. electronic parts of the Controllers are the most common error type, SMART cannot notice these errors. some of SMART errors are reported immediately ahead. these are particularly leshoists and removes. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete turnkey due to surplus-tension. of course, you can also have data loss due to an electricity out before you secured the files, but these losses usually leave without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices does not make a difference, these can take heavy damage during devices with computer chips and high-speed power processors, complete data loss, hardware design, hardware components and other defects. thus, you take advantage of yourself from unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against raptops is an overthrilling protection. this is a device that part of energy-storage absorbs and rest. it is usually available in the form of a socket. however, remember that not every plug-bill also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an extra-voltage detection, then you should be careful that he offers the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to the protection against lightning bolt and therefore protect the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overload of each cable is used to your computer, you should be careful that also all periods are connected to your computer. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as well. some manufacturers make Overvoltage support that also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity for the coaxial cable of cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable thrilling protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks, which is very small and you also included the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overthrilling protection system will protect your system from smaller variations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete case. even a loss of few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a break-free electricity supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Apart from the protection from surplus-voltage these devices may provide automatically battery-energy efficiency if an electricity loss occurs. some models allow them to even further work until the current run. if you purchase a USV, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements like an overthrilling protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and and compare its security with electricity disorders associated with costs for avoiding this. a high quality overthrilling protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you think about how well your machine is protected. at the end you should always remember all the cable before you drive to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can share it as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software. Google Shared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are at home compared to the hard drives, however, very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you will need to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution. therefore, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo-Community 23hq.com make online storage services available on photos and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for 25 $a year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the Web-solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically repliced thanks to the TCP-protocol and with the large companies is stored in the supply of a backup and a shared memory. thus, they are desastersafe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system zfs and btrfs pose at least the database integrity and system safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you no one says if such a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. it's pretty disturbing that there should be no protection to one day. no one seems to have thought of it. no one seems to have thought of it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission capacity as they generate intermutations within the data currents. in normal filesystem these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already, 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be able to deal with turntables on low level and is scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one for the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon also available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched a dedicated file system with its btrfs file system. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanism which are zfs and is also available for & Linux; it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Underestimate this not! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% for the job systems. notebooks are the percentage of the theft of 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss owing to viruses is less common than most of the most people think. it results in a lower damage than theft or reinstallations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has been no longer sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, travel Fs, JFS and XFS, to call the common file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigating process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an indefinately status will be avoided. if a file was not completely stored before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human errors are the root causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 lightning settings of fundamental physical limits. meant that while the technology is developing further there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and caterals for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 Megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteriorated for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or bigger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive get you today for 100 & euro; therefore, you do not charge any other data loss today. so, if you do not want your data to be affected by any data loss. so, your data is often associated according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the reinstall of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your backup on an external SATA disk. if, then one day, a lightning strike, you were lucky when the drive is not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot. forget flying unglücke: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desaster prevention is always a non-storage. bring your backups up the stairs into the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a frequent reason for a loss of data while safeguarding the panic. if you have a backup, which is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that are to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiating assurance: a backup of the files changed since the last complete product. generates a complete snapshot at two times: the complete assurance and the last difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original state at any time. this backup comes from a versioning system, the next one with the exception that it is only off, and not continuing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmissions. this happens compressed and if you would like to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Ensure important images directly after watching them on your computer to DVD or other optarian medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure lets you have enough time to detect losses and restore. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of work files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, in image file stored IPTC information, Associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, Visitors,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">With that valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years, that is about time-span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future because of your nature is unpredictable, you must look at everything today with caution and rate new during the time. unfortunately, there is no other option to be fully compatible as the current system backwards. the less variations you have used in the past, the more easily it is to assess the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that's important to read your pictures, then save it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is fairly simple: every time you change your machine architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should review your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually always growing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's suppose that you plan the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record.</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, if your new record was detected by the system, but do not attach them.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBs; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and replacfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sad c1 # change the size of alpha if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not have any software you can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format disappears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG, as an open source standard the GIF should replace it. however, XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color-channel and full transparency. PNG, gamma- and chrosite data can store for improved color information, but not as many as TIFF, but not as many as TIFF, and this format we would like to recommend you to the storing of your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a reversible compression salg.mus (delate). a problem is however that this format was adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negatives file format is a licensed free and open blankets that developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed because of the need to use the camera formulation. DNG is already available at the TIFF / EP format and we hope to use the co-competitors Canon and Nikon it to some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has implemented its XML-based XMP technology; a mixture of XML and RDF; it is a marker technology that allows users to embed their data into a file even if file information is saved with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer an original of your recording, mostly in the Rohformat, archiving. XMP fits this since the metadata file will come separately from the image file. therefore, you should think about whether you use DNG as container and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organisation that supports a comprehensive range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI includes working on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI Communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightened efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the dealer or the scanner, as long as the images on the camera edium are you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert files into DNG and save it in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a finite processing you can use external programs. if you want to use the pictures again with & digifted; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under circumstances from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then in Webgalerien, coding you in MPEG, use in contact leaves, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digists; you will find in the section of some photos on your hard drive. you can add the camera interface to you but many advanced settings to import images to your nightclubs.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digidae; connect them to the computer, turn off the camera on the scoremode and turn it. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, you try to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a skill picture at the bottom and the previews of all photos on the camera will appear. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the file order for each file, photos, movies, music etc on the camera displayed.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information about each entry. with the aspect properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file features and the photographic information that is internally saved from the camera. a symbol shows that the picture has not been downloaded at your computer. note that with some digital cameras do not provide all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata like exif, manufacturing, GPS etc. of the picture. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digidae; or the image processing. note that these metadata are not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on their computer, the click on the button download and then download the selection from all. this loads all photos from your camera to a single album in & digidae. when downloading the photos do not get deleted and we suggest you check if the images are safe to delete in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select only the desired options selected with the standard choices of & kde; once you choose the photos, use the button download and then selected the button-chosen as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option new is available. these images have not been downloaded by & digidae; in this case the new images are marked with a star in the window display. if you choose this option, you will be downloaded only the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the buttons all download or selected, appears a dialogue with which you can select the target album, in which the photos will be sorted, displayed. details for the folder you can read in section My albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After which you have chosen the target album, press OK, and & digifted; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all deleted at once by using the button Delete. if you only want to delete some, you must select it first and then use the delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no way photos that you have deleted from the camera, they are completely deleted. so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully removed from the camera; if you want to delete them from the camera. if you don't want to delete it from the camera, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photos often not particularly expressive name. this may be deleted once back after the photos from the camera should be deleted. so it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was taken to integrate in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and spires of the image and for data-based locking. if you use this latter option, a folder per day is created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos may be stored on the disk. the first two concern the data about the author in section standard authorisions. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish another date format than the default format, you can use e.g. in the machining field the prefix photo-% Y-%.% B:% S:% S:% S. for further modifications you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename, you have the option to change the filename in small case letters. or in case letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which & digicame; for a photo used, is shown below the name that displays the camera in the preview. your settings for change will be saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera lens.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digif; can carry out all the information about the orientation of the camera to the point of recording, to perform an automatic filming during browsing. not all cameras will provide this information. in the section sidebar Metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic filing is usually turned into, and if your camera does not provide this information, leaves & digifted; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to switch the automatic reline, use the button Expanded and select the automatic lazing in the bottom area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera records information about the date, where the photo was made available, can create & digists; this subjects are based on image data. not all cameras will be loaded onto the image album. not all cameras will display this information. in the section sidebar Meta data you can find out which information your camera could have embedded into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually off, and in that case come & digifted; the photos directly at the destination album. if you want to change this, you have to turn this option and select the option dates based on the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The simplest way to load photos of their computer on their camera is the button download. select then upload. the file-optional dialog & kde; appears when you can select the files you want to uploaded, you can also choose more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">Once the selection is done, asks & digists; you where the images are to be loaded too. a folder-optional dialog for camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to load the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. thus, a position is targeted in longitude and latitude and that can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be displayed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to carving an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architecture offices and immovaries can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was made, you can access a browser which allows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digifted; users who want to locate the location of photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is well the positioning data of a photo take part.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as direction, panes and maps are supported. therefore, there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the correct hardware, using the IPI module for the geographical assignment (manual) and most recently via the manual input from known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit, but there are a few who work with GPS receiver. either as a card module or by sending the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS-Interface: CoyoteEye Ipaq Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be made with gpsman or gpsbabel. you must save these data in the gpx format, since this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, extract data from images and GPS extract and correlation it. on the following page you can see the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the exifying tool of Phil Harvey. it uses the sign-known coordinates that were created for example by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European street types. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digists: try to give you much control of his working procedures as possible. there are many settings that added to the behaviour of & digists; change to settings, you need to choose settings. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on built-in Preview or picture editing may be set. they set out the standard behaviour of & digists; if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, standardization and copyrighted data. these data are automatically selected to the corresponding IPTC data fields, when the option is to download from the camera application. also with a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for the editor: this field should be the professional designation of the photographer. this field should be the professional designation of photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a detailed description of the author, this field must be filled likewise.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author if this is a screenshot for such as Reuters or Associated Press. if the image is a bearing picture, then the group or agency should be made available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. it is achieved that the metadata changes are permanently in the picture and not only entered into the database of & digists; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into & digidae.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images stored in JPEG compartments (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you have to add to your photos, with the images found in the pictures. note: with images, which have already been canceled, these are overwritten by the formation of & digists; overwritten.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse-cursor is rests in the main window above a file. depending on the selected option this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; thicker; supports a number of different image formats and several video formats. to determine which data types & digists; indicate, you can add the file content to this list and remove. each file in a & digif; Albumordner that has none of these extensions, ignored by & digists; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by clicking the button Refresh right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminous of & digists, however, can be set on this page to the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchrist mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size, you should only use on rapid bills. if you have one, then you can thus obtain better visibility results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing takes a black background behind the indicated photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select this one here. you can switch the toolbar, if you use the image processing in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed parts of an image can be marked with darker or brighter color in the picture. these colors will be specified here. in the picture editing, this invisibility mode can be entered and off-off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-samsampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color formations. please read this article in Wikipedia for the further explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation is reduced not the picture quality, as PNG using a reversible algorithm. the only effect is that images put more time to exit and pack. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value to a high compression. thereby, 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compress you can turn the delate -compresseshotgchim for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality, since the slate-algorithm is completely free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the attitude of loss-free JPEG-2000 files you can hide-free. even if you've written the tempted hiring settings, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was not yet supported, the metadata were not yet supported, but at the planning stage.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digidae, the picture editing only an image considered for photographs. currently, it is very fast to create a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are equal. if the nobleg green pixels from the CCD sensor can react to ultraviolet lines, this difference creates a bit soft, eliminating this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the picture a little soft, eliminate the 2x2 guitarpatterns with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white-off of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the whitespan is not set. standard is it a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white card, which was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures in four steps more detail in the Spitzfedern. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the Spitzlichter, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the inability of your camera to capture the top quality in the settings. the setting will release some unfolded results as it shows the Splichter in various rosaries. finally, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the Spitzfedern.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible since blue pixels in general aren't as quick saddling as green and red. & dicraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still unssaturated blue pixels. of course this is a matter how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When selecting the option, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminally value to your liking. you probably need to put it a bit higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of & digidae; to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing -algorithm is a digital image process to anticipate a complete image from the substitched image sensor, which has many cameras and which makes a matrix colour set available. these algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farreconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digif: and Dcraw introduces you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some testing it has been used. VNG interpolation (variable number of Gradient) was the first algorithm of Dcraw. however, it is interesting when you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color variation of your lentils you can set the red and blue-corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a different color correction, as you will be carried out during the pipe converts.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the Farbinations and gives instructions how these are to be returned. there are also LCMS and & digists; information like the Farbinations of a Farming in the others are to translate the colors as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour questions when a picture is opened in image editing / color module with feedfiles.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colors Folding the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles. & digigot; examines the folder then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility & quot; Standardsquot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed later on opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color-view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are colored not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be matched to the camera plate and model that you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain color-mapping or gamma or gamma web. currently, there will be corrected dcraw Gamma not for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you need to perform the color-mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate as your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer can play a smaller colour area as your camera and some colors will therefore be very saturated. this could you manually correct, rather than rely on the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided with them for what is intended for. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. therefore, here a table of cameras and profiles can fit together. this answer is obviously inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon type expanded the style for the purpose: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image concerned and image processing measures. through the program, this interface can support & digists; many modules have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these modules are then loaded by & digists; these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the pros.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short rest for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under settings short command.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules you can get over the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The attitudes of Diaschau should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusted the time between the images, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other cruising fields turn off the metadata and / or which are in the bottom end of the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics point on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right top there is a button Automatically linked to identify. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is connected, switched and connected to the pictsheet mode. currently, here are serial port, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) -mass storage device. you need to specify here the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / re, to provide you with your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digidae; you need to connect the camera to your computer, turn it into the display mode and turn it off.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try off if & digigot; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camerodell and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirming dialog for moving from &gt; images in the trash cans, you can adjust the interpolarity of & digists; in the deletion of a photos in an album. in the sections of a photo and deleting one album you can find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly used by & digists; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar, without any feedback. otherwise, you will have to apply changes with the button tab.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also embed the ad of the welcome screen from & digidae; in case of starting, this speeds up the starting process of & digists;</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Am start looking for new photos are forcing & digigot; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digists; if something emerges from the base folder, asks & digists; you whether it should remove them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color diagrams can be used in & digists; used to customize the main window to suit your tastes. these settings can be selected under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs were defined in simple textfiles. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digists; find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digists; includes a quick image editing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of entry ads.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a range of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digists; therefore, you may not be part of your distribution. further information on the KIPI modules can be found in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifier and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A toolbar at the top and including the toolbar for fast access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of images change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original image before you save file, or the button save from the toolbar, as soon as you have saved the original image as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. this you can do with file storing as perform.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can reproduce the original image by using the File Restore or the button The button reproduce the image editing in the toolbar. you will lose any change which you have done in the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly every action of the picture editing may be done and recovered. the last action can make you re-catching by selecting resins or reinstated by selecting resellers from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you are often using this, you should make the shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to be disconnected and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to recover.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB, on the back-to or re-establish button in the toolbar a moment longer, you will receive a controversy menu. if you choose one of the menu items, all actions in between also be undreted or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the picture editing, you can move between the photos in the same record or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image runter, or the entries in the file. if you have any changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo and zooming in which you can use Ctrl; Mourad, or the icons in the toolbar, or the entries in the shop menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnification factor automatically choose</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen insert displays the photo in full-screen mode. you'll arrive in the normal view, in which you will use the Esc key. normally you can change this in the dialog dialog of & digidae; change this you can call from the & digif; main window. see the section for the setup of the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select in the menu file image and get the default & kde; printing dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases. you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album exporting print assist. if you follow the assistant, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">Das & digif; Hauptwindow has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and promotions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigational disk, also in image processing. it is shown when one of the five riders is mentioned:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multifaches clicking on the same rider lets the sidebar appear again and again disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the procurement view, you can insert plug-in using unlimited size or insert. please note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are permitted in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are reversed after 2000 characters and are illustrated. if you want to use the IPTC cutters in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you commented you either use the button or simply switch to the next picture, the activation are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and variety. it can be applied to a single click on the 5 stars into the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field urgency. the coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to the filtering of the keywords, the sample-tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digival; -session responsled.</seg>
<seg id="362">The sample-tree is dynamically adapted to the given index. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in finding a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief at the input of keyword on a picture series. if you have given various keywords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be placed through markings of the corresponding attachments in the tree. all the keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected at the top view and select a keyword written in the keyword, this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection, If you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar sampling filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - filing and search results. if in addition, one or more keywords will be used out of the right, only the pattern of the two are displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop. suppose you have chosen in the main view multiple images to provide you with sampling. if the keyword exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and put on the selection. as a result, a dialog will ask whether you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example the main window shows the images on a calender date. the sampling filter is reduced to No keywords, which has been chosen with Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword was pulled out of the right sample-tree on the choice and there. a dialog asks, whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. it can also be turned off under settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you usually have created and created with and determine that there would be one or more, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry for which in the database is searched. this may be an album, name, keyword, picture, key grasp, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can add a Advanced search of all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need the crosswise end at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. see the options as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly used it & digidae; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colorfully workflow, this is the colours available from your camera or scanner, you can achieve a predictable variation of the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a colored workflow you can achieve the colors on your monitor those of your camera or scanner, and which suit the colors you print or on the web that publish your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the issue comes on color management, everyone will know which buttons he wants to press for the results that he wants. unfortunately, the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information on your local administration system. additionally, you will find links with more detailed information to make your own informal decisions to make you achieve the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all the criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color-management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB paint chip. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image balances are via email or the web, where sRGB of de facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and life for everyone so easy, why should we use another color tree and thus have to worry about color blends?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we really see will be shown below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colours in the RGB Color area, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you wish to compare the 2-Dimensionale representation of sRGB with some larger farms, so please visit Bruce Lindbloom excellente page and then click on info and then information About RGB Working Space.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to do my monitor, if I decided to work only in the RGB Farming room?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you're working in the sRGB paint room or not, you will need to monitor your monitor simply because sRGB works out that your; onitor has to operate on sRGB. if you work as in the Farming room of sRGB, you need to either use your monitor on the RGB standard, a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections which can improve in most cases. use it before you try a further manual process.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, settle, automatic steal and contrast expand from the menu Corrigieren Automatic correction always try to make your colours the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which in your photo appears.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method converts the luminous size values about the entire image, making the darkest point black and the lightest point as bright as possible will change without its color shady. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Absame: this method makes the luminosity of the colours of the selected image, so that the histogramming of the intensity area is as shallow as possible. thus, the same very good results in improving the contraction of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation which either causes miracles for a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic stealing: this method maximizes the color area in red, green and blue canals. they determined the dark and bright border tones and adjusted the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogramming area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of one image by moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a re-styling of all values in between. this is only visible in full-washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-tree of & digists; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-off of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-right correction is something limited because of a color tree can be done with 8-bit per colour. if you can perform too far from the original image, in case you can perform the white straight in the Rohamp mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities will be better utilized.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-like salm.mus which is copyrighted by the copyrighted of Pawel T. Jochym. they start it on the menu item white-mounted type of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window display can be adjusted within the size. on the left hand side are both the original image and the Preview of the target image. if you want to see the original version more dynamic, then click on the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in histograms.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right top is a histogram indicated that dynamically changed, as soon as you change one parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most pixels very small Luminous values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or the sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shade will be able to improve the shadow of your photos or down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Connecting with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipe. press this button and then anywhere on the picture show around the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white bar. this type will also be set the temperature and green value automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the whitespan with the list of preference. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The indicating indikator increases the colors when more than a color canal is overexposed.. You will be the combined result in the white picture shown. this is shown in the preview as a reiner indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons storks as and store exactly this. any adjustment of the white-bar you have set to save it in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The preset button sets all the filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral white outlet. note that even neutral settings will result another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set here the Kodierungstoefe per color TV set. 8-bit coding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding needs also more records, calculating time and is onlyric for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the use of color profiles. a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter color-administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors and value correction. this tool presents an integrated way to use multiple color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you can always find the same correction. in the manual for the key correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way of correcting problems is the tool for Gradation that you will find below colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digists; tool color effects will give you four color effects, a solar panel, a velvia filter, a neon-effect and a cantonal filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solararization, also called Sabatier, an effect of the picture was completed by the additional light. this had the effect that the lightened areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity also controls the solar power. at approximately 50% intensity, the image shows what is possible. another raise will finally create a negative picture that is not to generate photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system. the original image is the (1) and that is under revision (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the above & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a satiation by making it a stronger contraction that makes the colours brilliantly and smooth. try it simply, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the market name for one at daylight optimized converted color film created by the Japanese company FUJIFILM. Velvia offers very saturated colours on daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias greatly saturated colors are but also some photographs, especially those which hardly strained landscapes too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter levels controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neo-light. at large images the filter may extinguish the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color conglories and the luminosity of the photo. you can watch for experiment with the different color logs of your photo with the tools in the menu. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are happy with the result you are using the button Ok and you are being applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you have a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too great satiation. also in this case, the tool for brightness or saturation will reduce it. all changes you can perform in the preview. if Him take the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple lighting / Gamma / Gamma is the tool Tonvalue correction to improve the exposure setting. even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated, you need for the content explained in this tool only the area of droves. concrete the three slippers below the histogramms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of the Intensity, a Histogram, of active rabbit, or the selected area. under the graphs are three slippers to change into the image and which can be moved to change the Intensory values of the picture. the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the operation is the regulator to move and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side the original and the preview of the image can be seen. the preview is dynamic, using the settings of the image, updated. on the left hand, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection program can be set, whether the histogrammes can be displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. in pictures the large areas of a constant color will include the linear histograms of a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is usable.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three shelves: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamble values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjusted the input values of shadow, middle and bright notes. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each field. there are also two shelves to be used to change the output values as well as in input values. the compression of output values can be used e.g. to create a hidden picture as background as to see something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the images will be automatically set depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with these buttons, the values displayed in a filesystem can be saved and later loaded. the Gimp level will be used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour-pipettes, the input values will automatically be adjusted for all shade, means and Sundays. activate the color picture to put the input values of the histogramms for red, green, blue and the Luminant channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of the indicating indikator controls all the channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels. here it is an indicator, that is, you'll get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on seeing the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target picture will display. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier Channel: this selection allows the channel to be modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logical view. for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera, linear mode is the most sensuous mode. for pictures with big fields of a constant color created the linear mode a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode will continue.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you want to move a curventary to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones with darker strokes can be correspondingly and that the associated images will be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to change this markings on the area you want to change, a suitable line on the curve will display the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your liking.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can make exactly this. each bend that you have created this can be saved in a filesystem and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp Short format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colour pallets buttons automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of shade, middle and solar tones. activate the color picture to put the points for the red, green, Blue and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option of overload indikator controls all shades, to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel surrendered pixels, you get the combined outcome. here it is an indicator, that is, you'll get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on seeing the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black / white photo shown in Luminant-canal. shade and Sundays was set with the color-pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel-mixer of the & digists; image processing is a tool to improve the channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel-mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the Canalausdial box you can select the color for the histogramming: this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the leftist area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to your own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture features a vertical line in the histogramming to display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix the overall brightness. if you can also adjust the appropriate color components, as the channel blender then enable DAS to create a great black / white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black / white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of colour comes to a visible pillars, which occur from the colour palette. if that is the case you can improve your Monochrome converting it, in which you will reduce the color initial first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The saliva as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any Mixer settings allows you to save for later and then load. that used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of the indicating indikator controls all the channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels. here it is an indicator, that is, you'll get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on seeing the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is restarted. the option Luminanz is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photographs, black / white a working, as color pictures can simply be converted to the computer. also with a set of movies profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white filtering coating with a green linsenfilter. this looks good, all the scenery pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cocin (tm) Green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangeilter: simulates a black / white filtering coating with a orange overhead filter. this improved landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cocin (tm) Orangeter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white filtering coating with a red linsenfilter. this creates a dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moon phases on the time of day. therefore similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white filtering coating with a yellow coating system. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cocin (tm) Yellow-filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates hot bright and middle shades while he added a bit of cold in the shadow of a pressure and the redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and with it similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digifted; tool texture allows you to apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, irrespective of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, the bullch of an old master, a pop way of portrait out of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu image shows the image editing the image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three-dimensionality of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2). the parameter relief should have been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digifted; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping an eye on the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep your attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to streaker eye. under image frames the module can be started off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired cream type for your image. perately umrances the picture with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black / white pictures), covering it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a bone-effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The original image size will be bigger than the original one, but the same side-relationship have. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool to cut off-ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text in an image at any point. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to used. simply type the text and place it with your properties as you need. you will be the drawing size of image size. the larger the picture, the larger the character set. for the end you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press the button "OK." once the picture was saved, the text part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikless; tool 1, you can create a stencil with an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image which can be used in the image processing can be used to move across an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should add with maximum compression (9) to the default compressing of the file size. whom you want to add an e-mail in English to the & digists; mailingliste digicame-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your stencil with the button-folder with the button-folder. select here the folder in which you noticed the stencil files. these settings are marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the series has been set, a construction structure is reflected in the folder structure of the stencil folder. the selection of a folder is updated the pre-timeline of the work it automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Beneath the Preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnifier and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is magnified the above picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse knob.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button-reduced the underlying picture. it is centred around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the image to the whole image, you need to waste the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse knob.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move under the underlying picture below. take the picture and insert it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template on your image. the image will then be automatically adapted to the default size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digists; three different tools are available to you. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but especially in dark areas, gratifying images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharfe Maske operates at the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it's not a bit, it works rather psychovisuell. you can use it to remove atmospheric dark and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Repercussies may possibly be the best of the three since he really improved the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images need a correction of sharpness. this in turn leads to a common color combined with minimal difference. this in turn leads to a common colour defined a little blur. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more detrimental sharpening than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG-pictures a camera is often applied to internal sharpening. pictures in the raw format, on the other hand, always need to be squeezed during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner turn a poorer already during the reading of the picture. if you disable to disable you get control of your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by calling for a photo with the Schärfen-Werkezug. this can call you with the menu item corrigid sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should deal with caution because the results are not very natural: the sharpening increases the sharpening of edges, but also intensifies the noise. in general, the usable technology to raise an image the tool repercussies. you can achieve further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is much easier than to sharply. use the tool to connect with the menu item cord, and experiment something with settings. the window display on the right side of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the picture. window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should first try out. an increase in radius or amount to strengthen the effect. if you create the Unsharpest mask, the noise and the impression of grats close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. you should therefore raise images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpening is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The corporal value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable differing amount. one can thereby define a minimum difference to the pulpit of the filter. thus, these areas are avoided by a soft change between the tones of the sharpening and therefore avoid flaw in facial, heavenly and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the working picture (2). blur masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">This & digists; tool repercussies reperceives a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it uses the copyright protected unprotected unfolding-filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create an image & quot; repercussionist quot; in which there is better approach than trying to raise the photo. it is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using better results as blurred mask. you can run it from the menu by using colour reflections in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular Folding is much better than the Gauß's Faltung. the Gauß's Faltung has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result of the source pixel, which depends far from the original pixel value. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's Faltung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel. the causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the main parameter for the use of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. you can set a higher value if your image should be blurred, but if your image should be very blurred.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpable effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase in the Rauschfilter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the smoke filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a high value is 0.03. a high value is still further polluted.</seg>
<seg id="502">Palate's scarfs: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpening. use this parameter if your Unsharfe Gauß 'is. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal zero, so you may also have to increase the correlation and / orden Rauschfilter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die size: this value determines the size of the transformationsmatrix. an increase in die size can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular sharpening or the Gauß's Schärfe. however, note that the module will be very slow if you choose great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The storyors as well as loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any of any retooling parameters set you set it will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the sections, color and intrictions on the image before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible immediately, but will leave later unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read pictures and compress, & win; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, they produce better results as sharpening. this could be caused by causing the inblur masking a bigger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, you have to create a sharp masking, always artifacts artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of insecurity. it is practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filters at least as good as the Unsharfe Maske. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better for the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for auto-focus tse due.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpening systems in digital images, you can read a technical comparative comparison to English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Regler Glätte relies the insharpness of the partment of the drunken, in order to generate a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color-tinte allows a adapted color for the pupille. if you want blue eyes rather than dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove the desired artifacts associated with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Input algorithm was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to convert the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a homogeneous lure above the image. a value of 0.9 should be preserved to detail, that no sharpening is necessary in effect. please note that the details are always subordinated in the direction of the approach.</seg>
<seg id="520">Straightening addiction Alpha [0.100]: a small value glossed uniformly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie gritt or CCD set, a high value waveable patterns create. JPEG artefacts are best located at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. put this value accordingly to the level of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set. the higher this value is set, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turmoil effect it has to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is running through. normally here 1 or 2 can occur.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular gradual da [5, 90]: angular integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is chosen as well, you should also make small angles for a long run. therefore, you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral pedals [0,1, 10]: integral pedals in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More about quality that you receive by choice of this option is only low. it doubled but the term. we recommend it to allow it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons storks as and loading exactly this. any setting of graphical errors can be stored in a text file and then be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Picture error correct is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and a high CPU load to move. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button disruption.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image defects made with little artifacts will be corrected. the module is made on a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an analogous camera. as you see, there is a peculiar black artifacts in the foreground, that by a bad film storage during the trip, the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digists; Rauschicke is a very powerful tool to reduce images. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool presents a selectable image filter to remove stains and other artefacts which are for example from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove tightening of the camera or moireacute; the effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and an high ISO sensitivity. it shows a gratious rustle, which can be successfully removed using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you just need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings may remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can remove the image. the area moves through the radius and the color in it will smoothed and thus minor bugs agreed.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpening: controls the sharpen the filter to look ahead to asparagrapes. if it is raised, smokers may be erased. you need to change the edges of the filter if you need to change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and smelling or lubricate up again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the exact accuracy of the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not occur the entire noise or gradients. place it on a value close to the maxum, if you want to remove a waking smoking or JPEG-artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Illuminance: controls the luminance of the picture. we recommend you either paint or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the picture. we recommend you either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of dark areas, which typically are more consuming, however, it is also the Schattentions.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the alignment of the Phasenjittergel. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is reacted. if he is lifted up, the edges may occur if he can occur on his minimum, can remove noise and phasenjitter at the edges. he can remove nips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction, which you set, can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the cut-reduction was applied with the standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes, a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to drop the image a little soft, is fortunately much easier than to find an image. use the tool to connect with the menu item cord, and experiment with the smoothing. the window display on the right side of the dialogue will show the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digists; photo restration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photography contacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artwork from your images. it is very well adapted to eliminating Gauß, Screw, Kompressionartefacts and local mistakes which occur in digital, original or detrimental digitised images, and thus gets the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texturkey. the text content is carried out with another tool, the picturemanual, performed. the algorithm to restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Franna's project and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduced: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a deserted Compressionsalg.mus it creates some compression & quot; Artefactor; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons storks as and charging all this. any setting of free restoration can thus be saved into a text file and be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and a high CPU load to move. you can therefore break the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with like-shaped rustle. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a minolta (tm) 700i camera on an Ilford (tm) 700i camera with a Sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can recognize the infamous film grains on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example for photo restauration. this time Textures was reduced to an old color picture, applied with a scanner, applied. you can see the scan artefacts resulting from the Scannerlighting and the photopier. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Das & digikam; tool Hotpixel permits the hot camera images with a CCD camera, eight were to remove. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are copyrighted by Martin Dickp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw-mode photos a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression via a built-built suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixquot; and "quot; bright pixquot; on a photo with a dark-picture subversion method. there are currently no manuelle method to choose the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistant with the button darkest. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to take you to the dark-picture directly after you to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous chapter, you should download the appropriate dark picture to the corrective image. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and this automatically loads back to the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the picture. the window display shows the output of the filtering with the current settings. poor pixels are taken up in all occurrences.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter's viewing. then select the best filter method to dissolve these pixelves. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: it is determined on an average of the neighbouring states. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixel in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this will be done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels have a distance from 1 of the pixel block, will be dragged for the calculation of a bi-linearen surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim).</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block will be deducted to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which then is used to interpolise the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be dragged to calculate a bi-cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of cubes (1-dim) or a group of cuban curves (1-dim) that is then used to make the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hot-pixel correction on a color picture, from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, the original image was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digists; Vignettightening is a tool to correct the vignment, that is, to correct the novious corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Expansive objective, especially in the middle and large photo-format, can frequently illuminate the entire sensor sector. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. Telelenses show under circumstances this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he has also disadvantages. many center-filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 with the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. expansive objective, even with center-filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unsharpened effects arise by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposure of today filment and color-scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by simulating an equivalent transformation in a commodity pattern which is made without these filters. the tool Vignetape is turning into a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the Vignettightening filters and take three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of lighting absorption at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2,0, what an optical filter with a bubble adjustment of 1, or accidentally designed to compensate for a greater degree of vigilities, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstrength, contrast and gamma settings: the cover of an image with the Vignetabort reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the Regulators are providing you only positive values, since you only need to increase the settings only.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine resignation of the target image, so let the values for illuminants / contrast / gamma at zero and use the Gradation of the & digifted; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetorangey applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminaire and contrasting correction was also carried out at the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digists; Linsenverdistration is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortions. colourful distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second Grades deals with the general geometrical distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or convous form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar spherical effect, but flap on the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth ridge is corrected the remote corners of the corner to the second graades. if you combine these two can be eliminated any geometrical distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion second cades. with negative values they can be corrected by tons-shaped distortions and positive values of conscientious distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth grass. this value appears stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the "corner parameter has the umberated sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus leads a correction first mades through. negative values increase while positive the picture crushing.</seg>
<seg id="583">Clear: this value makes the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview the distortion. the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or large-shaped correction should be done in front of all states or size changes. at best, you can cut this correction than all the first. if you make a picture new and then make a tonnellular correction would be the effect of the false Wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to you will display this tool a vertical and a horizontal help line. move it to an important place, like e.g. the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines in this place. afterwards, you can fix the tonns / kruffling distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you want to correct a cone-shaped distortion, the resulting picture black corners will have. you can transform these with the schneider tool in the menu transformable cutting from image processing or via the zoom of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tonnellular correction is enough. the next logical step for some motives such as recordings from front, frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees. keep in mind that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have an easy equalization of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of tonnellular correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infrared film the GimpGuru.org Website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensor range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window you can select the area for preview. if you can move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters of filtration and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option to simulate the granting texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO Regler changes the amount of film granules and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter colour channels to reproduce infrared film mixes, especially the green-channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of an infrared film based on New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the original image below (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a type of aura in the shiny.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digists; filter movie gritt is an easy to reuse tool to reproduce filtration of your images. this is known from classic high-speed movies, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies, the manufacturer of great silver grains of the photographs.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grained effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to postpone in the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grained sight specially in your monochromen photos, so you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">By regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to the control of intensity and granularity of the Körner. the standard value is, although often higher values are required to apply to ISO-2400. if you need even more bodies, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film graffed on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and working the (2). the packer-sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digists; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digists; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature bilder and Stillive are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two shelves to influence this effect. the upper blade chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better for large images. glossed controls the smoothing or, from the other side views, the maleness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the working class is marked with the (2). Pinky size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digists; filter coal drawing is used for color-drawing. the lines that define the reverse in the drawing are emphasized. images of their gradient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine the scene you have chosen to sketting you. this would be good pictures to begin with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regator chooses the pin size and the underlining the contrast (glue).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the record filter. the original image (1) and the altered image (2). the standard settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digif; filter Gravur shapes your image in 3-D as if it was steered in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digists; Filter Gravur is a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3-D effect. it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important thing about the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray one.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork using carving effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Breakwater 1: shares the picture in cells and makes it look like it is looked upon by glassblocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Breakwater 2: analogue to breakwater 1 is distorted here a picture here of a different version of glassblocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can abort these effects at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork using insharpness effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharfe: blurred the picture alongside star-formal lines that emanates from a center point. this simulates the unsharpness a zooming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial insharpness: blurred the image by rotation of the pixels by a focus. this simulates the impose of a revolting camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance of removal: blurred the picture to generate the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Lack of movement: caught the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the impose of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographic, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Setting flying unsharpness: caught the picture soft into the dark and strongly in the bright notes. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-photos or to add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Feeding harness: blurred the image by random shift of the pixels and simulated the insharpness of a random orderly camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpness: finds the bullocks in the picture and wired them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it, through the filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make rain drops out on your picture. by doing it gives natural your images a nish appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dropledge size allows to change the size of the trop. since the dropledge size does not increase automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the optical effect of the drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digistic; image editing an area free from rain drops. use the tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should stay freely. if you start after it the filter regression, the area will remain free from rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of regimp. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) suggest a sunset after a storm. the standard values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, so you can bring it by Spiegeln or turning it into the right orientation. the tools that you will find in the menu transforms and transform spies.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A painting is smaller. the big question is, how can you hold a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you find the missing information back or guess? the CImg algorithm is used here, making it a good work. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below to see.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change a linear interpolationmethod that want to share the pixel. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge one image. & digifted; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo inflatable was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You will need to tell the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain side-ratio: if this setting is activated, when entering the new size, the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set. the higher this value is set, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turmoil effect it has to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons storks as and store can be used precisely. any objection for photo can be saved as text file and be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very quick at what it makes, but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load. you can cancel calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflatable by adding a small color picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the Preview (2) is the result of the linear standard comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a often underestimated tool to cut a picture. the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull the rectangle, create. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you get rid of the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look at the cutting area. you can change the size of the area directly by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle create you by clicking it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are happy with the cutting-section, use the button-button button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the file to save or file storing down in the menu file to save the cropped photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In advance, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Up aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high format, the larger value of height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool to cut off-ratio uses a relative side ratio. that means that it is always the same, irrespective of whether you can use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their side ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons for the selection automatically horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog you can set with the Max. ratio knob to the area for cutting on the greatest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool fits into side ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the access tool for the next time, these settings are stored as standard values depending on the orientation. the changed image measurements are stored in the EXIF tables, allowing the EXIF data to reflect the cropped image and do not reflect the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the pooling aid allow you to show help, so that you can put your pictures better together. these support are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-thirds, the harmonic triangles are a possibility of a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles towards the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Center: the Golden Center is a split that is divided into various natural growth rate, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy, or the inflorescents of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we see as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrationale number 1,618033988... and you already used to build the ancient Egyptians and pyramids. artists and architects made the golden sharing at all times when you put your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number after 1 is the sum of its two previous numbers. the resulting part is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that is normally followed as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides needless aid lines when you put a picture together. these assist will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you to your goal good results for your photos. compared to the third party, the Golden Spirale produces a smooth line that leads the eye out through the image along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the right-corner of the golden Spirale, also called Golden Rectangles. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. that can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without the eye to guide, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also leading from the above golden sandals. their vertices are the middle points on the sides of the golden triangles. note that contrary to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not a triangle triangles. diagonal to these lines can be put into place an static object dynamical.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame generate a effect of the professional photo graphs dynamic Symmetry. try your image focus on one of the sections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and Vertical are used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera accurately vertically or horizontally. this creates an image where things came around a angle. you can repair this with the & digistic; image processing and tool free rotation. choose to transform and adjust the waypoint.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button presets you can set the slider back to 0 degree. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module is free to create a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse-cursor in the picture show around the two lines. after you have moved him via an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, adjust the angle as described in previous sections.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have filmed a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is the function transform and cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the function automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing offers the picture a bit after the filming. however, take note of the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixation of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are created by the transformation, into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are created by the transformation, into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle at the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle at the bottom: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adaptation of the perspective the picture becomes a little polluted. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you adapted the perspective you get unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to make this, it's the image with transforming plugs from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool-tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotating, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can transform this module to transform sheers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Configure your image by using the horizontals angle and vertical angle. you can press horizontally and vertically at the same time. a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the viewings.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you become a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse knob to fix the lines. you can now use the tool gear to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the bowel, the image becomes a bit wiped out. for a single coating, this effect is usually negligible, but two vertices twice as much swiss and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the padding has the picture unnice triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate it is the image with transforming plugs from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digists; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were computated. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of images with & digists;</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats on their system. but you will always be JPEG and TIFF included.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digists; only displays files in formats and one of them with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file is shown in the image processing. you can change this list of file revisions the & digists; accepted in the section configuration you will find further information.</seg>

PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should indicate the time in seconds which will display a picture below. a low value creates very sudden, a high against it very glatte image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should let it black. the name and the path of the created file you can set under name of the MPEG-output file. keep in mind as possible with the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under name of audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted to your preferences, you can easily drink the making of the movie. depending on the speed of your bills, you can now easily drink a coffee or drink the diaschau once you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodiver or tools are missing, so you can adapt the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages to the right settings on the right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The passistant permits it to print multiple images on a piece of paper together in Standard Photosizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can upload your images stored in one of three formats, TIFF or PPM and convert.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the commandline tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original student from Him is: expect the same results generated as the software from your cameraman. sometimes you get with dcrab better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that is to be converted and launch the module. the Raw image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the knock preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the converting process to optimize the conversion process. the main parameters such as Gamma, brightness and Red / Blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contracted information. if your camera is working in RGB mode, RGBG switch does not have an effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the entry result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a corrupted algorithm and produces for the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the reversible LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to process your pictures frequently or later on, you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allowed a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you are JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process again, so you can break down.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack-device mode allows you to convert different images at a time. use this mode so if you are sure, e.g. by testing at a single picture which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The settings available are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, this is helpful to rewrite the existing file automatically. however, this is helpful if these are created in a earlier attempt. a preview is not available at how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can put the prefix, the starting number and timestamp that should be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can enlarge the image or enlarge. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: no disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pressure preparation: prepare the image for the photographic print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photopiers. the target image, including background size, random size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the photos previously. you can draw on the list of images to be drawn and show there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After which you started the module, the images will be shown in window frames with the pictures selected. you can add additional pictures with a filename. for the last picture, a preview is shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and drop it down to add the list of images to scoring images.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images remove the selected images removed from the list of images to vertical images.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all pictures, you can open the new message window with the button OK. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you select is attached as an attachment attached to you.</seg>
<seg id="877">If you do not send too many pictures at a time. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a filmed file the comments are attached to the images in a text file and attached the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend you to the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you are JPEG under pictures file format and the original files in the JPEG format are then the original excifs are added to the senal pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is completed, the window will not be automatically closed so you can see the status of status, in search of errors, but you can automatically start your e-mail program. with the button button, you can log in this window?</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module, Distork appears a window with questions like you want to have shown your slides. you can choose between the photos selected by you and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL outputs in the presentation will be activated very elegant lines through OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, as otherwise the diaschau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename view indicates that the filename of the images in the lower left corner will display during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. you can then manually break it with Esc; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images are by chance select that the images are shown in a random order. thus, it is not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">While delay between images can be set the temporary distance between each images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transitional effect. so you should flottest before you show the presentation of your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There is more than a dozen transitions of which you can choose. by chance, by any transition between pictures has a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diaschau you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, to the previous and to stop the next image and stop the slides.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left of the screen you can see the current filenames, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & dates currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-Imaging @ kde.org. note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background is a tool to set an image as a background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module combines the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see & kphotoalbum; through this browsing, see picture. as you can see by comparison with the picture, are available in each group, so in people, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have provided information when you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current previews. in the following each one is described for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse to the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you choose another person to select only the pictures on which both individuals are displayed. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of images of a few thousand pictures to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have chosen all the people, places and other settings, you can view images to view the images of your efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to save a custom image, this also applies to places, keywords, and other categories that you yourself have defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images beside the name, select the button which is located on the right outside on the toolbar. note that you can use the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must choose which image is to be displayed for each individual person. in order to see this, you'll have to display the entry editor's image (in close connection) and select the entry factor to your individual wishes and choose which part of the picture will be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you open the entry in the main window, a dialogue will be shown that the dialog for the fixing of the image features is very similar. this dialog can once again look at the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a character string into the field labeling or description, you can also enter a date to search for this text; the date may be either a part of the total data, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, according to pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are pictured.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read handbooks, but prefer to try some features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quickset, the screensavers and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialogue the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select in the menu for the menu item. then, some example will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a cohesive HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this list can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this list will present you data-statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display you multiple different time units. each body then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. in the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the box only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used in the following ways: you can change the specified view preview view from the database (when you select a date, the first image will always display the current date in the preview window) and the timeline will always navigate the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so the time information will be displayed. you can break the selection by clicking on a beam of timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your paintings. one is integrated in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as a module available (see). in the following part of the user's manual; an integrated version described you can create via the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML-pages are created, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and destination. in the following each area is more detailed described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the superblis and a description that is supposed to contain the HTML file later. at kphotoalbum; HTML-example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; -exporter will be created on the overview page. approximate information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed by the viewer also without a description. for example, that all images are exported to a party. please note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images exported. you can therefore not use this attitude to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this field you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings options are clear, why this is not specifically answered.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images. by doing so, those who regard your website and possess a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no images download the example resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your side cannot change the resolution at any time. so he can easily browse your pictures with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time, as if he wants to show a picture bigger he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you place the different folder and the URL you will be stored where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">You can select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for any subsequent proposition a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you have to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder is saved and automatically added at the next time. this folder you can select either a folder or a KDE Support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your pictures, you can check if they're actually selected all for viewers. if you have created a URL for the basic folder after the pages were created, this folder should be set. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet at the final target folder you need to manually copy it. thus, the import function, see correctly you need to provide the final target of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="930">The currently described setting options apply all three to basic folders or URLs. in these cases, a subfolder created, whose name you specify in output current.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're sitting on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, together with other users of & kphotoalbum; you might want to create a HTML page about viewing the images. however, if you're already a lot of time to write the image information, people on the pictures, reception, etc. then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work does not even need to be done.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import other entries into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they are different whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is just a shortcut to images. the advantage of all images to be stored in the file and that you can pass all the images independently. the obvious disadvantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu file or together with HTML-pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML-file, this is an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file search the images in doubt. firstly, the images found in the folder of the .kim file. the corresponding images will not be found, so the images of the URL you have to verify when you create your .kim file using HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is described in the dialog for exporting images you can call on the menu file Export...</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialogue is whether or not it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When the Manual is to copy to the .kim file you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatisch to copy the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">Kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not profitable to compress the files so you simply choose the option export file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is Maximale image size. if you want to send your friends pictures, the .kim file otherwise would not be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that every picture is a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file import... choose & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import and import consists of four steps. first, you must select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category persons of the importing file being personalized (if you are a Dane), while this category is called for your database people. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialogue window which are to import categories of the file imported files and which categories are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">The fourth step allows you to shorten the categories of the one-to-run file with the categories of your current database. an example here is on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">There must be simple to browse pictures and watch: when you look at images, you often want to view images within different image vacations and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">This manual contains the different steps from the (1) fixed the information about your images, through (2) the search and prestige, up to (3) advanced topics and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program to locking your pictures. but it has been extended and today your videos. at many places in this handbook will be talked about pictures, but frequently, this also includes video with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all its information in the index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. a normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions at the CVS, where they would like.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder in which your images are stored and used for future Starts automatically. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; so if you want to start another database tree with images, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the option -c. as example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; setup... get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following sections of the user manual, you will explain the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the links you see six different symbols, with which you can call for setting options of preview and the options for viewers. for each setting there is a detailed help available by clicking on the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In it, you describe how you can define different properties, e.g. people, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog, which is used to already working existing groups. for any existing group you can select a marking and select a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options you can set up complete membership groups, so for example, all members of one group should enroll in a group, instead of explaining all the groups of a member as well.</seg>
<seg id="956">When you see the settings options available to you to the fixed selection of the members. with the above listed selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window you'll find a list of the current category and on the right one list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum, shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digifted and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface. approximate information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called over the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; are but separate. however, most modules have a help page which you can call over the modules ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications along with each other, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; therefore only very little tested using the demo database; demo-database you can either call on your own pictures. "demo-database you can either call the command line &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or over the menu Help. say not, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, making it may be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not working. this is the downside when you share functions with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported their images in albums: this type of order does not support, simulates it for some modules the order by albums so that you can use the functions associated with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">Thus simulated & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds with the current view, so all the pictures that give you the picture look at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Beside the current album, & kphotoalbum, the modules also has a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in the game dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you use for example the category people, will do & kphotoalbum; so do you decide whether you could have selected persons and pass this on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photophotoalbum; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog, and select in the section modules which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you see an example of a grid screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, take a look at the top of a menu - and a toolbar. in the section you will find no information about your pictures. in the section we will see this window, but now click on the entry images to give you an overview with all the available pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with notes on the picture, where the image has been recorded, etc. you can place each image individually or for a larger number of images or at the same time. if for example on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for reading and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes if you can use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the moving of images inside the list: if you have a family celebration and listed on all 50 pictures of the same 5-10 persons, you can make sure that the names used up are postponed to find the people more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see a alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting the date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you might want to edit all selected images, and select these images with notes. just click on the front and back-buttons, which are at the top right at the top of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can more comfortable to mark all these images and to use the menu item additional items on one time with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. moreover, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window which shows the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the noticeable dialogs, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. additionally, you can also add an entry to a category and set it to make this one subcategory of this item. attention, this presupposes that you are currently using alphabetically. see this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the confusing dialogs by setting the growers who form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options..., which gives you the possibility to store the current construction and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a box completely. if you want to see this window later again, use the button options... and then window a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will receive an overview with viewpoints of the currently selected images, or all images if you don't have a filter at all. you can configure the size of the images, by simply searching down the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set as a background picture for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, this is viewed in the picture window. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display device will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the deletion button or select in the menu edit selection. now the window will display you see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum: offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use your photophotoalbum; you can also use images stored anywhere so that & kphotoalbum; you will have to record the images somewhere, so that you can record the images from the disc. in the picture, you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper hand is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. this is available for example at the images 1-9. however, the imagines are available, so that & kphotoalbum; you can see the preview of these images. however, you can also see these pictures with the image concerned.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see it requires that you want files from the folders and re-copy it. & kphotoalbum; supports it up to now not you to avoid insertion of the respective CD. if you wish to avoid any trouble as the mess turn of your pictures, please buy a larger hard disk in order to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want a little more privacy if you want to make a little more privacy if you want to make available for others, click on actual view on privacy. alternatively, you can also cover all the pictures that you can see your little sister, thriller and the menu item all except contemporary view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With that, you have set which images in the case of the case will be hidden. if you give the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu item pictures, giving all the images you're locked to be hidden. if you want to see the pictures again, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be entered to the unlock of images. to set this password, simply select password in the menu of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means very safe. you can access the file index.xml to read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this kind of password protection serves only to those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to those looking at private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you manage all of your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and chat via hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at it sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; using a picture _ and video controls, you can preview from the preview, as described, start.</seg>
<seg id="994">Viewers can see the viewer. it clearly shows the picture, but additional all the information you enter about the image, such as who is in the image, when and where was it made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, so you can simply drag them with the mouse and set it differently. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. you can see the menu-click menu below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the appropriate entries to this view. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser displays all images of Anne Helene. as if you chose people from the browser and then Anne Helene has chosen.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and switch back by using the buttons picture high and image. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run these as diaschau. & kphotoalbum; then invites a new image after a few seconds. as frequently it can be controlled by clicking the Strg button and Plus or Minus press. start and stopped by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability to switch from & kphotoalbum; it is able to change in full screen mode. in this mode, the spectator uses the entire place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to the full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer, you can use in the image and zooming. to Heroes button you can easily merge with the mouse button. with the Minus button you can re-extracted the Plus button zoomt in the middle of the picture. shows how a Zoom-rectangle marks and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can return your zoom so that the picture is not shown to be zoomed. with the same key uses the zooms, so that every pixels in the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work with videos that are in and out zooming with the Plus- and Minar paste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the functions from the context menu you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you'll have a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. in the moment you can open the picture and enter the configuration dialog of the picture to give this name. but you might not prefer to mark the picture and see further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to see the pictures taken on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and watch them as good or bad while you are watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the spectator has the opportunity to show pictures with characteristics while you watch them. features are the letters A to Z and you can press a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter. in see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have put characteristics on your pictures, these are available to you in the browser. so you can see all the images you edit, print or whatever selected, so you can simply use all the images to copy the selected images on a CD, or whatever you want to make.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the viewview. if you can display categories in dr view, then you can press features to the images by pressing the letter for the attribute after the picture was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case you allow yourself & kphotoalbum; on the picture to paint.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixer will not be saved with the image but in the database. to the type you can easily do your own old later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In you can see an image on the painted picture. in order to switch to the Malmodus of & kphotoalbum; to switch off on the image paint from the context menu. to finish the painting, you simply add the cross in the toolbar top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you must fully control the application of the program & Povray, but the documentation on & Povray: should you absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">At the object tree you can select single objects. then their properties are shown in the object properties and display the object in the wired views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected using the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the building tree, select the position to insert the object and click on the icon at the toolbar, or select a menu item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu is inserted, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can either delete items from the menu bar, or from the context menu of right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have altered properties, click to apply these changes. if you have invalid values, a message will be displayed with a error code, then you can click the input freeing, and then click on the changes with the interruption.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray: user's documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray: reference to the specified object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray: 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user guide to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray: 3.5 already includes the user's documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture you can preview a preview in the advert view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press thumbnails in the original view and a small example of the scene is executed with the chosen texture. as a preset, the entire texture will be chosen, even if you want to rename a subordinated item (for example, a texture inside a texture Map and not the entire texture Map), you cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the checkpoints of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is elected, the checkpoints and it will display a small cross in the spiral model view. this cross marks the center of scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifting. you can change the shift through token with the mouse inside the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Every object has a spiral point of view. you can specify this value relative to the point of view of the higher level object or as absolute value. objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their view-level of view is smaller or equal to the toolbar of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window view as a default. the object tree and the view of the building features are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard panels, or if you need any other order, you can set them any number. you can also store multiple linders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under a view, drag the initial water to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle shows then the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the first to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then anchored at the right side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you wish to arrange several views over each other, drag the first place in the middle of a different view. you can then change between the views through clicking on the card-box above into the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible formation order are downside views: opinions that are not anchored in the main window. to resolve a view out of anchor, drag the initial water on the desktop or click on the little left to the top arrow in the button bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the button bar. to prevent the closing, click the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are hovering, you can anchor them at any given place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save you with view shutters... save it. a dialog will display in which you can save the window of under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rendering them. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be properly installed. as this manual has been written, & Povray: 3.5. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the icon Rendering the symbol rendering in the toolbar or select the menu view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render-mode corresponds with the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it controls the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render modes, from a fast viewing until full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When you click on the icon of the Render settings in the toolbar or in the menu Render Modi menu, the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render-mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that can detect the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size, you can enter the width and height of the ripe image. if you want to rendering only a small area of the image, select the cross-section sub-section and enter the imparting of rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination of quality, you can select the properties using & Povray: for rendering it. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflexion lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user manual for & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is executed with only one ray of pixel, there can be different mistakes. these images often have a Moirè pattern or bowel effects, sometimes details are not shown when they are in the representation of less than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray: uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. in general, pictures see this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn anti-aliasing, calculates and combines & Povray: more than a beam of pixels. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray: supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the neighbouring pixel value. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively since any pixel ever continues to be split and adaptive because the record prices depend on the different color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the difference between the persecution of a particular additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the low value on 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated with a low value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pixels. if the difference between the colorvalue assigned the predetermined threshold, then the pixels is tested in 4 subpixel, which are individually pursued and checked on further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be set at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce the production of noise for the ray process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, changes & Povray: the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the rendering is diffuse rélexion. this is an experimental feature of & Povray. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. one pixel is then transparent if the associated rays do not have an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray. -Consoles will be finished. if & Povray: unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray, select the menu item Importing... and select a file in dialogue window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command volume of & Povray. if when importing error messages or warnings, a dialogue window will show a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support HTML-text in & kpovmodeler, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawEnd and / / * PMRWEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can export objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, just mark the code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and inserting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; likewise.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler: a scene is rendering. usually, it is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in an individual's view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray: user's documentation for the indicated object. place the path to your document and the version. supported the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray: search for external files (for example high field data) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file contained in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The colour for the wire-models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The colour for the checkpoints. the second color is used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle for the field in the camera view and in the window-type label.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context-menu of the wire-model views. you can set here the button separated for shifts, scings and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate a more accurate steel model and thus a better approximation for the indicated objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects like the ball, you can set the detailed stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the High Detailed view for extended projections, all the wire open-views are further divided, if the camera uses an advanced projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the sensory projections. this property returns a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall is mounted behind the objects. the wall is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the soil, a ground is down below the objects. the soil is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate cantonal leasing method, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling, you can set. precise information about the parameters can be found in the section Render-Modi.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window rules or create new lines. in the section window, it will explain how you can create and store plastic rules.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combined field standard-window detection: displays all existing window pments. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen folder when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of manipulations shows all existing window rules. a new arrangement can be created with the button Add, and select a select arrangement with the button deleering.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window-order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all the views for the chosen setting. new views can be created with the button Add, and select selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with a new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unencrypted the window under the existing window, with map view, you will receive a map view with the previous view and sounding the view not in the main window, but generates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just installed & Povray: and & kpovmodeler, and now you would like to begin with no more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, under its beginnings very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep the following warnings carefully before you complain that you as a result will just get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">When you don't insert a light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything faultless installed, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following prepureed shutters:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation, so you can expect a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">They often have to use these menus and symbols now so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. highlight the scene and then select the menu item loading. thus, you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wipes model shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate. in particular, you notice the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree contains now a new entry with the name camera. if click on it, see the content of the View object features, in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's documentation, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Don't change anything about the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that you can change the camera point in view. simply click with the left mouse button on a counter-down point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the button or press the input paste, the wire tension-views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the bottom for the scene. you could insert a quader (inserting body quiader) and size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a comprehensible method for resolving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simple way. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button paste or the input paste. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wipes model shows now also the plain, even though at the moment only as a limited ending level. if you rendering the scene, the plain up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree carefully, you will find that you click the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + before the object. in this case you will find the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit among the horizontality, only to get to know some of these parameters. select and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Only select the floor to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialogue will be shown where you can select how the object should be added. please select the object tree. the pigment will change in the object tree (name = soil-pigment), with a click on the button preview, see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course the Preview of the pigments only shows a Mattes black material because you can still enter settings for the pigment. do not always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't want to see color on the header and ball rolling, just click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the soil is now correct. if you rendering your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color option. here are further settings necessary. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called introspection. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select at the object tree every time, and change the colors in the view of the object features:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be done easily since you have already interpreted the basic work method of & kpovmodeler; the ball is just as easy as the floor can create:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings. Set the value for radius: on 1 (do not forget the entry or button to push the button. otherwise, the bulb would float over the ground as you have the floor to move down a unit down below.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering will now result in a strange result: as before previously, the ball-surface appears like a Mattes black material. put the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can assign their stuff now. like the floor, give the bulb a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the properties below and change the name for example in sphere of pigment. click on the cap Pigment, then select one-tone and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the below screen and click on the input paste.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of shine-effect and reflexion shows already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even when metallurgically is not selected at all:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & Kpovmodeler. hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytrayances is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you make a scene raytraced, the renderer hypothetical rays from the perspective of the spectator (d. h. from the camera that reflected the scenes like this beam through the objects and how atmospheric effects like for example fog. thus, the scene will be dealt with pixel pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you look at the scene. without a light source, you see also nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene, that is to be detained, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create a new model, the file is inserted in this submenu and will replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already have saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. it is a new file, you must enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Presents the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last file have been saved.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu item you can only select if you have not yet stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeats the last re-made command. this menu entry can only be selected when you have used loading settings.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current shutters and opens a dialog, in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing type of order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for change the shortcut shortcut. you can change with this option to change prescriptions for & ppovmodeler; commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens up a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove the commands with this option machine signs for & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to use smoking finishes, without any bump on the surface individually modeled and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file both for a dump map as well as a texture Map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes, which can use as modules: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture-map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base, using an image file as a color ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image concerned and navigator. the application has a file browser in which you can choose images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuicker; is very simple. the file's browser lists files that you can see with clicking the & LMBs; or the key return can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set if any picture is to be displayed in a separate window or if all pictures are always supposed to use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you're looking for a specific file, just type the first character of filename in the browser window. then a small input field is found in the right bottom. if a appropriate filename was found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the textfield through the gaps of Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog box - & kuickshow; there are five card cards. in three of them, Android and processing and slideshow, you can set the working method of & spheres; set in the two others, short rest warrant for the display and short command of the browser, can be specified using the shortcut for the respective window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">This is selected, then the images are open in full screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color. default is not a full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activated, loads & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder, while you still see the current image. this reduces the delay whenever you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option saves & kuickshow; at the end the name of the last opened folder. at the next start it will open up & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored beams to select a background color. this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in the window-mode, the window is bigger than the image, is also filled in the background with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can set & kuickshow, so that only some of the data types are displayed that the program can also be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option for large images the display ster will be enlarged on the full screen. this option is switched as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determine if the slide show begins with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">The time span between image change at a slideshow. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sliders or the small arrows to turn right next to the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions is set. if this value is set to 0, the slideshow is repeated until they are discarded by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or to use the sliders on the right next to the input field. the default is 1.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, which are mostly also available in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts. an example of call for the DCOP function, could only be like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the layout options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own commandline options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user an feedback if the script should be executed because of a lack of dependence. please check in your script whether all necessary modules are present and use the dialog, so the user may not pass, why a script does not run.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / maker you will find a lot of templates-scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a base for your own scripts. you will quickly determine that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with AmaroK and do Amarok. the easiest way is to use command dcop;, which each KDE installation should be enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands. usually the exec function is used. in this way it can be called exec &gt; relatively easy here. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; send alerts to all running script. for this reason, scripts used to monitor their standard input constantly and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script may even ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure indicates the script to indicate the setup dialog. to store the storage and charging the setup data, each script should take care of. if a script is started, Amarok puts the right folder on the folder, where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signaled that a new piece is played. the script should now be & eg; with DCOP features further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the strokes).</seg>

<seg id="1194">Customary Clicked: submenu itemTitle, capes the path to the selected files of the playlist. in order to add a listing item, you can use the DCOP-function dcop Amarok script additive (submenu itemtitles). to remove an entry again dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminated, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to handle for example Aufraciers. for example, the storing of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration may also install script packages which can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-archives (.bz2) compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend a archive-name as for example. B. suspected subspt.amarokscript.tar.bz2 so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amarok script.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok, is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & eg; Linux). further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screensphotos.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package of the package and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to install Kfilbs so (including those contained in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to have e.g. modules or scripts). we have compiled a small guide how to get Kdelibs minimal compiled.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD predict that your window manager will work on all relevant standards of freedcoptop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will help, for example, we are trying to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use Kdelbs and Qt because they are preparing an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make an error in the taglib library. you can preview the file off by clicking on the taglib / collection _ scan.log. please report this bug to the taglib developers under bugs.kde.org and also hang out the caputated file that causes the crash. afterwards, you can delete the file and re-create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is that taglib pickled when reading the meta-info from this file. please report this bug to the taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then please try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok. is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarok; used libraries were compiled with the same compilers version. if, for example & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, taglib was compiled, but with GCC 3.3.x have been compiled, then this leads to toplaster the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then deactivate automatic. switch off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail will automatically open up at a crash). if it is a frequently occurring off crash and you can send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is due to the fact that many program data can be used as UTF-8 in the meta-information, but not identified as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / dynamical playlist) can be easily forgotten. this is a known bug fixes. this allows you to click in the control center under apparitions of symbols and semi-transparent. note that in some cases, you can click on a symbol until three times on a symbol until this setting reveals its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error:: ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixlie, then check if Amarok the correct Qt library is used. this enables you to see with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep Qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix these bugs, you may need to remove any colonizing Qt version or remove / etc / ld.so.conf so that AmaroK finds the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some ways. most installer problems clarify the lightest by using an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also use help with other users or using the developers. use this forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1457">Saves the current project under a new file stream. KDE's dialog memory, with which you can choose folder and filename for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Stores all created projects. this is the same as if you would call for each project file storing.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Closing the current project. when a project changes and has not been saved, ask & K3b; after what has to happen. you can then leave between Save and changes. besides, you can cancel your closing down and keep the project so open.</seg>

<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Bring" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics of the project. the only difference is the additional button Bring, the & K3b; to burning the medium. the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project contains already data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the characteristics of the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described above the What is this? help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD-Project. it is useful to import files from a previous session to the current project. this is useful when you do not use files for a multi-session recording. this is useful to you, even if this feature is not used for you, so that you can already see the files and folders using the media.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD-Project. this feature prompts & K3b;, imported files from the current project to remove. all other files removes in the project. this feature is no files from the medium, it blends only the previously imported files back.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD copying dialog. this also allows you to create a CD on another medium. alternatively, you can also just create a image from a CD which you can then later burn later. in addition, there is also the possibility of the cloning instead of normal copying. you should try cloning when you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs.</seg>

<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can use either the layout program dcop, or which use a slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, therefore your taste and the type of your task will be crucial.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the multi-line program dcop. to utilize the & DCOP; -features must make sure that & K3b; started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Apart from the general & DCOP; -functions that have all & kde; program in common, supports & K3b; mainly two other parts, which are described below.</seg>

<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (compressed and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed to the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the flustless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. nearly every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), ogging preached (for OGG) or other Kodiver already exists. but all these programs are usually not necessary to compile something ourselves. however, only the Kodiver packages will be installed, which is needed. if for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>

<seg id="1501">A word to copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to cover any copy of the CD; it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD; just avoid the mechanisms of copying protection. just avoid the purchase of Copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup is to be done only once (the path dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration has been found), then after the daily handling of a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, about which you can often stumble in the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression rates and helps you with choosing the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lost audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey ', which may be available for this distribution. the downsides are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information caused by data compressing according to their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG, are the most common ones. OGG can have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important as both Kodivers are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame will still be supplied with most distribution, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high quality products (at high bitrates) but compared with OGG slightly more deep quality at profound bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or machine based on a computer system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, storage map, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - initially only support these devices in most cases the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters in audio quality and the resulting compressive rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good visibility to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "--preset standard '= This setting should be acceptable for most people and most kinds of music acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereotypes with high quality." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autobiographies. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane's = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be passed / used with & kaudiotator; and the Kodiererprogramm, to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodiercisions, there is often a combination of program settings for the codics and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the codiders declare the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; titles to add the keyword (English: day) add MP3s with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button labeling in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CDs, so that all other information can download instead of taking into the machine. it's worth note that here only by text is said: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc., not of the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (anew of the plot: that's the author meant) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent the information provided by the & CD; any more or less valuable, so the artist can still be inflicted with the artist nor the music business. all the information can be obtained by a bummel by a & CD; business, physical or virtualized.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively involved a crosswise box (sending a address). in this kind of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This may only be the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator is set up; for the use of freeDB, the geographical at the closest mirror can be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the bills.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more specifically, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note is that the cdparanoia package will have to be installed at first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To Save the auscled WAV files can be selected by the Kodierer and thus the desired file format. on the first Open (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a simplified compression for audio data) on the tab to setup the code. other Kodierer can be added on this tab by yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed by the corresponding Linux distribution before the co-erer can be used. this is also required for the predefined kodilerer. further information about Kodierer are in the chapter of Welders Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers you can get more information about his switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consoles window (eg; console). it must be replaced 'lame' by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have many causes. check the setup of equipment name of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc.), try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to start everything setup and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. the appropriate package for lame can be found for example with a search engine since it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you're on it (eg; by trying to copy something inside with the counter).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something which probably will be done once once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read out a & CD; what has to be repeated for each read & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the coding of the code (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it will be determined where files are stored and which structure is used. as we are lazy, we split the program to load the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we are likely not to change it in any reading one & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is transferred to the lesbian program so that it can read & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real-device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can also be specified, so helps to connect to the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the system instructions for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map-card General settings. here gibts do not do much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be shown as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only When ordering information can be selected, so that you will be informed if you are missing information on the testers (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. just two entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data automatically can download via the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Read the & CD; connected to the Internet so that he can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second choice field is easier, a & CD; entry found immediately the Read the & CD;. this is associated with low risk, if you are later satisfied with the database entry and the folder / filename or filename, you can change it. the directory / filename or filename with kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example it is further to note: if you want to manually enter everything manually, you disable the selection of options and freeDB is not used. however, this about 620 MB large, consider this twice whether this is worth. to freeDB in the Offline mode, the two choices have to be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for the retrieving the & CD; information of the freeDB server via the Internet. how does the system know which data the CD is to get to? read the section on freeDB. place everything as it pictured in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to page freedb.org and take a look at a mirror server near. on this way the load is distributed between the bills. however, this setting will function as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to what the server concerns, since however many Firewall the protocol can boiling the protocol 8880 by default, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol are usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to submit a & CD; data on the freeDB server should be able to deactivate the first settlement.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously outgoing pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time only an existing drive? Parallelele Read and coding? the author doesn't understand it, therefore simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, you cross this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Customised folder for temporary files: if you cross this anducks, then / must be stored the path / folder in which the WAV files will be saved. this box is not modified, the files will not be created in a private folder. do not forget that folder if you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything to enter as it is in the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under circumstances a bit must be placed right at the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned previously, this is an adjustment for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of tags to version 1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' meeting for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Continue the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">The number of WAV files simultaneously: at a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to add more than an WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; ended. this configuration is used as standard for each reading a & CD; used. if you chose the organizational structure of your music smart, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described as the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB is to be described, the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each one-going & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use one & CD; use the screen photos a little different from the data for one & CD; with successfully manually captured by freeDB data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of bringing them out of the Internet. comments are indicated to the differences.</seg>

<seg id="1577">If this has not yet happened so now the & CD; into the drive, which has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you search in section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD was successfully picked up by the freeDB, all songs of the pieces have already been filled out and are shown to the artist's name and album.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; there will be a window built, and you can select the database entry, in your opinion the best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the cross field for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings), you can also manually trigger by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have local database, you need to pick the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - entering the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen foto. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field of the "actual title ', the rest of the data in the input field' Album '.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be given more in the input field 'Aktuelle title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the single comments inidispares per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful withdrawal of the data from the freeDB is not empty the CD-editor are not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editors (e.g. if all words are filled with grandparents or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted notes.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary range. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have set unrestricted field length, at least on what is & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the code's code settings; take a look at the section's settings.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag of the created files later at any time with the tag. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all the codes or file formats, and see the co-erer in helping to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry which obviously agrees with the style of the auselastic CD; this example is not important since we do not submit the & CD; data will not be transmitted. for further information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are found at Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the choice of 'OK' come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors will be back and you'll see that the fields for the album already fills with the entered data which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next row in the window window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the titles of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed over the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles are selected so marked. a simple click on the line switched by selecting the piece or select the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the button selection out of the reading process, this window will appear to confirmation. click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders for switching on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling the orders. the first piece is currently read on hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message displays you if you are trying to work with a Kodiver you have not installed nor installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have given here in the example. did you check whether you write to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3. thus, reading and coding in parallel. note the status of the window at the bottom of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found configuration settings to subpress this behavior. the only thing is configurable to read this behavior is the number of parallel processes to read and code. in high-performance machines, the result is unclear. the machine used with a AMD64 seems to have no problem in simultaneous expression and coding (of however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read, while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the code. after the last piece is coded, a small window will appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the co-erer of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people, compiled by source files and not for users who are using a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be tailored to your needs when it is running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many versions of settings. at best you can learn the step by step, to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshot of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still am reading? even if only the aid menu has been clicked after the first time of the program, without any reference point as it will go on from this sort of empty screen (especially when at the time of the program you do not find audio CD; on drive), or from unusually short menu item?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is about? who reads this, probably has started the program. it should somehow look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot add or change this manual. it is the first version for a manual on & kaudiocreator; thought it may do. at least only after hearing with the author. and if you read this, he covered this section and is therefore provided with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you have succeeded in getting the source file from & kde; SVN, then you do not need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Caraokaspieler of & kde; besides others it has a real-time-specific and karaoke-real-time lighting of texts also some features, the other & UNIX; -MIDI player does not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, therefore work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support function. & kmid; supports also the & Linux; Ultrasound-Projector, which is needed for CIS cards. ALSA is included as soon as there is a sequence.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid: displays the lyrics to the screen with changing color, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (songs event or text events). Kmid automatically detect the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you finish & kde; during the playlist of a song, Kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, Awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can opening the opening... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also let a file from one & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and bettering the button Abogging in the toolbar, select the entry descending from the menu item or fill the Leertpaste.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece of automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then alternate each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; a piece play, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the rain.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow, you can change to the arrows on the left and right of the template ad. to resume the original speed, double click the tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The Leopaste has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the Leopaste like a pressure on the button 'break or selecting the menu entry into the menu item, so down the reproduction. if no piece is played while no piece is played, start & kmid; playing music.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lifts can be stored on two species in a piece of music. some pieces use text-event, others use lyrics, others use lyrics. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically established, which a song is used to enable you to manually adjust the entry automatic text selection, is automatically selected the karaoke text. however, you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a event type set you select from the menu settings the entries of text events and lyrics. the same function also have 1 and 2 buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you summarize. these are played in series following. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open first to collecting the collectors. this will find in the menu collection under the point... Click New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will appear at the beginning the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the playback in the collectors' room.</seg>
<seg id="1638">To the temporary collection all songs you will not want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When the application is used, this collection is not saved. concern you when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, they have to be selected in the collectors' button. there you can add a song with the button to add a song with which you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of an automatic transmission to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic filtering for the collection is activated, a piece of opening (using file Open or Drag & Drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatisch add to the collection is not enabled, when the display of a piece, the temporary collection is activated and gelded. this collection will then continue to add items added.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collector's collector, select the collection and the desired song and then click deleworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you choose the series following the submenu playful sequence of the menu, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or select a random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the gatherings, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu pieces, or pressing the button arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song back to jump, select the button previous pieces, the entry previous pieces from the menu piece or press the button arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the gatherings, select there to delete the collection and click on the button Clear.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted, however, that doesn't matter, since it is not saved by the abandonment of & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events translated into events that synthesizer the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map showing all events of the change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet and thus always leaves a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you don't need a MIDI map because all Soundcards GM -compatible are (incl. Awe - and CIS -cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI Maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file from your hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file which saves all necessary settings for playing one piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. prerequisite for that, however, that every appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END Define CHANYMAP... "END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section is beginning (except for options) and END that the end of a paragraph is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support may provide for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI are illustrated to your specific keyboard. the general use appears as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM -patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional allkeysTo M is needed to put all notes that this instrument need no gun tip (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun tip. to do so, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (the gun), it takes patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is a patch of the patch (Drum, basins, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone is the sound-height of the always same Drum (as it has some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify as notes on a specific channel or instrument is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as is their existence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can use multiple keyboards for each channel and each instrument. you just have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used primarily to form notes on the perkchannel channel. see for example the key Keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to split some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and the second channel, just make it simple in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-tools need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section so has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will of course use the name for this channel. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch will be used in the patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the pergola Patch on the counter-channel channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio indicates whether a MIDI file has been multiplied with the value of Pitch-Bender event. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch using the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used to be in the map file no decimalkommas stand).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM indicates that a keyboard, which is a pitch-bender event will play with the value of 4096. unfortunately, but try some keyboards to play two notes up to an octave higher. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you will find in the menu under settings, item MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboard, see which tones are just being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument at a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you have changed an instrument, lights are not green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played notes. view in the menu settings below the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc.. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I cannot force anybody, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file 4 MB needs (a compressage ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) von & kmid; without Awe support was compiled. to eliminate the problem you have to download a source distribution and install (for example by kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all the files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, choose all the files, and draw them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Do not necessarily activate the setting of an automatic transmission to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can use the arrow-button left of the Tempo- LCD, to slow the reproduction. to restore the standard speed you can double-click on the LCD double-click.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -window a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a MIDI Datei file) or I want to play a file, only in the & konqueror; window turns and the desired file to the window of & kmid; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them equal to a collection, turn the setting of an automatic filtering to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection added.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you only want to play the first file. so, set up an automatic Add to Collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then included exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then exclude yourself, also B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent to me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animate me to participate in & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; in the moment I am in the third year, so I don't have much time for my hobbies, but I'm trying to take a bit of time for my hobbies, but I'm trying to take me a bit of time. as Hobbies I have printed, MIDI files, make music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">They really make me a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group, I will send me a postcard from & kmid; if you want to send a MIDI file, but you should contact me as I have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and had to swept it to any money. I therefore want to emphasize that I can only get to programere, because if I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A soundcard. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality is much dependent on your soundcard. it is not the same if you use a FM-device or an Awe card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have soundcard, you need to compile & kmid; using the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you would have a sound card, except you can of course not listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The window windows is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. either, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is reprinted in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to send the favorite links below the menu bookmarks but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which will be playable according to each other, so you should use the category Daupherty playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy rules. if you have an entry, his group and all its subgroups to the current category is copied and the playback begins with the indicated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' updated piece ', TV and thumb playlist may also be changed by direct edit the XML configuration files. of course, one can only do if & kmplayer; not running through an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category click on the menu view and be displayed as the readsheet of a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing your XML files, you have to choose from the menu abed with playlist and choose either the processing mode, or another category selected.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processing mode will leave or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Owing to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by the edit of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change by [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can easily be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / debit / kmsuit / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / debit / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at the starter needs not to be short, it will automatically terminate through the opening of another source. this would be annoying at the end-animation, however, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a startup animation may be the ads of a favorite image: & lt; bodywork; & lt; img; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet; & lt; / bodygt; In the source package of & kmsuit; are in directory tests / some examples of smil that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider about the configuration of MPlayer in the configurations dialog of & kmPlayer; here the path can be adjusted from the MPlayer and the intermediate storefront size from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmPlayer. here is the output of mplayer clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configurations dialog of & kmPlayer;. all needs to be configured through manual content the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayguc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla will be played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even display the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages may be reusable, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the MIME type application / x-Shockwave-flash in the filtration of the mouths of KDE can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & kmPlayer; is available in a consoles app and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. the stamped process is pable. if there is no error, the backend issue is within & kmsuit. (view, console, or console to consider from the context menu).</seg>

<seg id="1760">With the automatic understanding of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & kile; automatically a single line (for entering the text) and the page loads (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be deactivated in the MenÃ ¼ Settkile; typing... LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; maximum the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is all the most common and subtle element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure, the individual elements can be changed and examined by a mouse click on the question.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; the files can be very helpful for return. once an DVI; -file [gerÃ ¤ncal File)] was created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -spectator to the appropriate line in & latex; -Source.</seg>
<seg id="1764">An DVI; -file contained a description of the formatted document and also other information such as font, or & latex; there are many tools for view, conversion and printing of DVI; -files for different systems and taps.</seg>
<seg id="1765">If you are looking for the items contained in the DVI; file with the editor and as soon as an element contained in the DVI; -source code is provided, the exact opposite of it. once on a section in & latex; -source code was clicked, becomes the appropriate place in the DVI; -viewers.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is simplified at work with multiple files. using a Master document, working with other integrated .tex -files is simplified. in the use of a project, a project-wide Master document project can be set out in project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast delivery: the & latex; -Source is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed (if no error occurred in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; -File to be unberyâ, and is not a call from & eyepiece; after the rapid construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In view of the beating the toolbar, the three major items were striped out for the quick incorporation of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the fast moving of the document into parts, chapter, sections,... The commands & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The inchoice of other forms for example of articles such as tags, fuelling, notes or references.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, an image or any item is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed term (selection of a selection).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When passing quotation quotations, a selection list with literary uniqueness is displayed. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -Files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down by the name GrÃ ¶ e is for defining the font. it allows the main text to be determined on the main text, the fuelling, notes etc. there are the following scriptures for reference:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, there are two choices available: 1. the Assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document and restricting the settings. 2. the document may be written by hand on hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ Documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font. if the scribes does not establish at the beginning, this can also happen spÃ ¤ter in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code was typed, the & latex; -Source Code has to be compiled, the simplest way to do is the use of the building or the button fast-tone.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The code must be saved from the compiling. & kile; for storage, the storage is automatically generated.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Blows the compiling of the document, should be chosen in the logging for the errors. when using fast-making should be started & Okular; this is not the case, should also notice the logging.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (engl. environment) is a text that is treated differently from the restful document. for example, a report with the lettering document will have to have. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ end {environment} might have been possible to cover the Ã bud of the scrit in the surroundings, the "Riesigâ," (see HUGE).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The Ã hikes are located only within the area (of\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no circumference (number) for the downvization within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to brighten the readability and ease of use of the document. it can e.g. add certain fonts, liking pressure, Italic pressure, submissions, submissions, etc. along with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the crescence and is long as long, until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be displayed with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quotation in the document. the quotation starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source texts with the & latex; the recording language was represented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistant a little text was entered, a few adaptations for the better readability of the document should be traced. here, there should be a quotation, a few places in the lipid and cursivprint and a poem to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been seen, using editor-view or Ctrl can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window has to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document may be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simple sample and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a long-term file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi output like printer, & PostScript; / PDF -Umwandler or Computerbild.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file changes the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed correctly (in the viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; -source code has been created, the transformation can begin by means of other formats in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"" "the start-looking for a direct leap from the editor to the wrong position inside the DVI; file." ""</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binder files. here, only Modern under settings will be set up... tools suitable.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to prepare the scream search, the mouse cursor is positioned in a line of the source text and slept on preach. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; -viewers will be carried out then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okular, with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the appropriate & latex; -document of & kile; used & kile; in & Okular; to set up as a text editor (settings are set up... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should be displayed in the case of superstructure the & DVI; -viewers cannot lie a mistake. should be a mistake, this is displayed in the log file or in the window display.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file invents the error source in the source text. in the editor you can look at the error of previous LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤tster LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤tster LaTeX errors to see the faulty line, must be clicked on the fault in the log file and & kile; jump to faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the corresponding button in the toolbar is clicked, a window appears to choose the template for the document. the prescries features are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">If you choose a document, a document can be written either from scratch or assistant to generate a new document. further information can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Provisional users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates, created in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, it is necessary to create an existing & tex; - / latex; it can create a new template using a template using an existing document and selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using a file, some chars are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can set in settings Kile... settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating a template, it is therefore necessary to know which character chains are to be replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by the input in documents. type:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the add-to of the commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document then it is possible to create your own template instead of by default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created in a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; uses & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting from many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made directly from & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and its possibilities to experience the manual should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; can begin directly with reading the chapter on the editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; -command reference, which can be called the MenÃ ¼ Help LaTeX reference. it contained an excessional description virtually all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with gedrÃ ¼ ckter Strg button to cover the & tex; -word meaning that in this way by clicking on\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When playing the text with gedrilled linker mouse-mouse-mouse-mouse, the full text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow buttons, with gearing sections, can be considered parts of the source text in the editorial window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to search and uplift the most varied kinds of source texts, for example, the & latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulae are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can imagine the springtime springes within the text. the MenÃ ¼ entrÃ ¤ge Bees jumping mat or the corresponding keypads are possible to make use of the springest or last jumping mat. this springtime is also highlighted that at the first entering of a drawing automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Working is probably one of the main aspects when buying a program like & kile;. although & Kate; already outstanding features were added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; some commands may include specific commands and commands; special commands for the text of text are contained in the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="1817">WÃ ¤hlt a complete paragraph (group of lines shown on both sides a blank lines). with a paragraph there is not one text containing eight lines (like in other text texts). the only preventive things in & kile. the only preventive things in & kile; is that the sÃ ¤tze are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">WÃ ¤hlt the word under the current cursorrow. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also & latex; -commands with a return scale (\\) and a detailed star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For spoilt of a part of the document can be easily removed and by pressing the button def. & Kate; offers the keypass Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offers using its own commands to contain faster result. below are the following commands to contain the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removed a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is contained in the description of the workaround paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments also play a central role in & latex; therefore, offering & kile; for additional commands under beating environment for a precious simple work with & latex;.</seg>

<seg id="1823">With this command is sung to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the chimney of the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1824">When the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {surroundings}, at the end of the environment, is sung by the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of welded ambient commands can be lost quickly to the Ã ¼ d preview. this command slept in the last sheltered environment so that the slaughing operation structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; -groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important precepts that correspond to all of the surrounding environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command is sung to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the graven clamp clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command will be sung by the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right behind the poppinged clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If cursor is before or behind the grained clamp of a & tex; -group # is, is sung by the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many afflicted groups of brackets can be quickly lost the Ã ¼ hensive Groups, this command close to the last group so that the weld structure of & tex; -groups are not shaken.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; are used two simple trials to use in & kile. for the purpose of its inception, the character is used. & kile; knows this case and includes two trendent beginnings for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic case of double initial cover can be set under settings Kile... LaTeX and can be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also configure large settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and thus German or French character. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When carrying Shift of Shift; input paste & kile; an intelligent tick-connection is one. if the current position within a lists environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize) is, for example, not only a ceilencape, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already a good source code embracing has been installed in & kile; for special commands (usually for & latex;), three to need and the other two are for automatic filing. all of these modes can be set under settings Kile... can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment by means of the command\\ begin {surroundings} will be & kile; automatically the command\\ end {surroundings} add to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">With the pushes of the return-button, the last letter of the input is removed and possible to provide the fully-performance list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter also.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameter. alternatively, the descriptions are removed by & kile, so that a just jump to these positions by using Exming springes NÃ ¤tste jumping mat NÃ ¤tste jumping mat and that can be explored.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under settings kile; typing... kile; amplifiers can be made to these lists. it can be used by different winding lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands and despatches of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command modus is for the comprehension of environments. it's always possible to have a few letters associated with\\ begin and the call of the referenced list is used. on the other hand, the environments often used so often that & kile; a special mode for the comprehension of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the fulfilment mode, the compelling class or switching button leaved is automatically filtered in the area and it appears\\ begin {. afterwards, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is accomplished, the environment is automatically closed again. once & kile. realize that it is a lists environment, even a first\\ item command will be included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings kile; typing... kile; amplifiers can be made to these lists. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ rting StartAddr & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>

<seg id="2026">An action can set by settings actions... click on New action to the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action cover keypzel. with click the button user interface can be assigned a keypot; with cein the current shortcuts can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions can be entered into the detectable settings and when executing this action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can modify the document or use (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplu; yourself are the fast start-up or the different Behold,... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified pole is allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir Variable in the command line: $KDEHOME / share / apps / quantitative / quantitative in their path: $PATH There are other special variations to be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file, file: / from the document's name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods a script can accomodate from & quantaplus; on the default entry, can be determined what is sent to the standard input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually reasonable only with this attitude.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of this application can be diverted. there are two types issue: normal issue, written on the standard version; error messages, which should be specified using the default text written by giving the value the optional output will be set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in any case, it is not too many, therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you have to add and configure actions. select settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Aktion Knopfes at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the day to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, in case the day attributes, and you are planning to use their use, enable dialogue on "view" when available, so that you can enter the action of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kCPedit; use of the & kmenu;, graphic Further programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kCPedit; uses standard 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, you choose to edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action is doing, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I have decided to create a grid knob to create a symbol. through the use of green (green is usually interpreted as los, starte, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user signaled that pecting this symbol is a & lt; startup; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplu;) and selecting the desired action. besides the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Push the one button and continue with other tags, so there are still which, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to supplement some usual & quantitlus; functions to the toolbar supplement or it should set this to better overview by some separators in multiple groups. open the toolbar to set up dialogue on settings of the toolbar. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (not left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow-button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to add a quick way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator assist the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar, could believe that the & konqueror; -knob the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by proving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the correct folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be imburner in the right folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust her & descriptionrc; so that its toolbar (s) is opened (n) if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps most mentioning expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting speech which you like most. therefore, this chapter as I describe a & PHP; -Documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might prove to the & quantitative; -Repository will check if somebody has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatt- / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we leave you, the second we handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documetary code Section 2 = Section1.html Section 2 = Section1.html Section 2, tag1, tag2, tag3 func1 = func1.html tag2 = tag1.html tag2 = tag8html tag2 = tag8html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level domain 4.2 Subway = Table of Contents, # navigable, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note that before and started and Language Reference. this shows that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess heads (except by reason) mdash. but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents of the table is referenced directly to a file (and consistent at the top of the top-view & mdash; a folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Blanks affect nothing but watch out & and & lt; character. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative; Resourcendatoms are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The table section is the area of the docrc file which is to be displayed under writing a & PHP; script for documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array -function is to be displayed. by flagging of the function and pressures of Ctrl; H for context means the documentation would appear directly here: the context list (ContextList) and the file-binding.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of-separated context-elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc, namely after $HOME / .kde / usr / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / etc / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc for local or global use. then you create a folder (as you set these in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and worthy are to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Repository measures for the use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitlus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the condensing resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with promotions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via e-mail to friends, partners or to whom. at different places there is an e-mail menu item, such as DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) send email, type toolbar, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates, and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded in our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are checked and only made available when our team provides them as accurate and beneficial for publication, to make use of the resources, for what it provides a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is assured, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">While upload, you will be asked for your private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys you can choose to choose. in the dialog New resource, the input stream (URL can be empty) and started with a click of OK the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can upload by the menus DTD DTD-Package (DTEP), toolbar-toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts tree can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before the installation, examines & quantitation. in case of problems it is warned and it can then be cancelled. please note the warnings and resource correct, appears a message with the information of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation may be time-consuming because hundreds of day files needed in the day XML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion may be started by the menu DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD's description which is to be used. afterwards the following dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions: die string, die im! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantitlus; after the conversion the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitlus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand them and draw full benefit from & quantitlus, so that one has to get familiar with these fundamental conceptions. this chapter is trying to bring them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantitative; little benefit of these concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitlus, the field of work in three areas is divided: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a series of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each one, the & quantitlus; uses, available. by workings about promotions, everything is highlighted as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; saved. this enables the Group of administrators different to secure ones, actions and patterns in the global tree, which can then be available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are customised patterns and workstations. local elements are stored in the user index, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all done by & CSS; -patterns to work with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply stated, this is most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder-tree of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns of all staff members within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editorial window, the construction thumbnails with information and the toolbar. please check in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the box with the right mouse button in order to get an controversy with the current document left to get an erased, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-down menu in the editorial department lead to a further context-click regarding the beating document contents, such as basic processing steps (Excissor / copy / paste), processing of the file under the mouse-cursor, or opening the file when the string is called under the mouse-cursor a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editorial department, the toolbar of the editors are shown & quantitlus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbar is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplu; the toolbar is adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if you want to insert on a simple day, e.g. & lt; pgt; you want to insert the tag for this just one day. you should insert the data for this just one day. you should insert it a day that has several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog various fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree-view (QIT;) allow it to navigate and roam in the information about & quantitlus; navigate to open up and roam. in the presentation with cartels are available for files, project, designs, documentations, scripts, attributes, and documentation constructions.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that displays all files in the project and allows the submerging of files in the project by using legally mouse-click. actions like Add, removal, uploading or delete the files from the storage media can be performed with which indicated context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantitlus; is the use of templates. nearly everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates may be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only usable in the project. more to templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of disintegration in Global, Local and Project is also working here. by clicking on the left mouse button you can give the available information to a script. the right mouse button are further functions available, such as the script to start, edit or send us an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by links-clicking of an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the elementary. through the right-click of a Elementit opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other top views. with it, you can change a lot of attributes and namespace. this allows the content to be exposed to the applicant, allowing the modification of all available attributes with few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the Web-technology for your development to find. there can be a packaged documentation for & quantitative; 'Documentation site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be inserted, edited and looked upon.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplu; two cartellants at the lower end of the window, can be achieved over the beneficial information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map-top shows information about each in Quanta current script. so, for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This box art shows all errors in the market-up of the current document. & quantaplus; -Scripts that will be executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaphlu; workflows are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the appropriate command. the chocolates of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with e-mail. & quantaplu; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar-archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure these in & quantitlus; how any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantitlus; to pass files on your system. for this, autoconf file a number of options that can be transferred to the configure script. / configure --help you. / configure --help one. the options are easy to understand and not running here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble at the start of & quantaphlus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of their bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web-development tool for the KDE-surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for a fast web development and combines a well-engineered development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; -Editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to employ: what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible markup language editor would be? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest WED-tool tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, it is & quantitative; now, when you can define it in & XML; if one can define it in & XML; then it should be quantaplu; therefore the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim needs to be arrested, that & quantitlus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; development community is based. & quantitlus; hence, in good use of free software, the idea of why developers, which makes someone else possible? thanks to the & kde; -scaffold is not only all possible but it allows users and developers, & quantitlus; to expand how they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows webdevelopers the use of intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can extend the productivity dramatically. by means of self-coated movements, scripts and toolbar, the automation can also be able to make a scripting language tax. (read more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and quickly developed to a well-engineered editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>

<seg id="2114">& quanta; becomes current and served by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file which is not located, whereby the oldest entry is taken.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the section about templates. should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project folder level, only one mistake will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Convert to inserting from the clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML; switching, so that they are correct and not be understood by the browser as a formattacking reference.</seg>

<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar to the left of the main window. this column allows you to put bookmark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other prescribed documents appear in the menu grouped after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantitative; -projects are stored with the filming .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to create files into the current project. the selected files are then copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched for the project directory according to new files that could be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files in your project folder or subfolder and add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transportation methods depend on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, as & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapter & quantaplus; projects find the details explained.</seg>

<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be set up by settings actions... can be added via toolbar toolbar, or you will be questioning if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the point of view. that does not delete it from the hard disk. if you have not saved the toolbar, you are asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplu; -team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens up a new EMail message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>

<seg id="2175">In the subwindow configuration, you can switch event activities and add or delete these promotions, change or delete. event actions will be executed when a previously specified event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantitlus opens; the last project that was open. this behavior can currently not be influenced.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantitlus; closed, the project file will be automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantitlus; changed files. same happens when you load a new project.</seg>

<seg id="2180">Folder behaviour also as well, however the entries are missing and opening up... with the right mouse button on the right-click menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here, different profiles can be chosen. the profile contains information about the site of the high-read files. see.</seg>

<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for high loads. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this has not to be changed but the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving feature or danger. use them after your discretion. the password is stored on the record, so it can't be read simply, but anyone with programming.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbar. it can be used in a project many views, i.e., by simple exchange views can be loaded and replace the currently open files and workstations.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened or deleted in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via settings of the toolbar toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitlus, with which you have to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplu; to its own work method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are the toolbar in & quantaplu; the best can be added to the toolbar using toolbar. the addition of the toolbar is dealt with in the section of Add-toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons that can be set up by using the context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which the new action can be executed, can remove other promotions such as the toolbar, can be specified in the dialog, which can be specified, which actions on this or other toolbar are to be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the Contenmenüs to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries are in addition to remove the action and have shown action to be edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set in the menu with settings of the toolbar... and set the settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentette, code scure and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates basically such as an affable file system using extender organisation and interfaces. you can copy, move or each at the system existing directory in the deposits. templates have in & quantaplu; in about the restrictions you imagine for a filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitlus; mited templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions attached to each template used before use accurately.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is anything that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples may be found in the storage room under global templates. further information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document. on the basis of this templates, new documents can be created. normally, special framework conditions for the purpose and organise the work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples may be found in the storage room under global templates. see in for more information about the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always included in documents. you can find everything, from a comment on a final note to a complete screen on Javascript or Perl basis. see in for more information about the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, this templates for whole sites as templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be organised in a folder structure, compiled in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitlus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File When templates save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has happened, notice that (even if it is stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the project tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File When templates save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with stoves and disassemble on the construction mantle templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is available only in a pre-layer folder. it can be used all administrative functions to do so, such as pulling and tting or pasting about the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In a file tree or in the project files, one can click on a folder right and select Site template to enter a name for the template and secure. by default, the project is backed up, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented precaution. you can insert headlines and shape, or dynamically with & PHP; create, files or link with them. additionally, one can keep some things in mind when designing templates in projects very profound.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The advance structure in the sub-window design is based on the files in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / maker and $HOME / .kde / usr / quantitative / quantitative files. each of this folder is equivalent to one of four types of tank, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, click on the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and to select in the context menu features. the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is absent, as soon as the attribute of attributes is pact.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is standard activated by default and fits all except the regular folders incorrectly. if a regular folder would basically disable if they were explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text tree. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allow previous or reprinted text for templates in this folder. these could be general headlines or footprints for all templates for a specific project and allows copying ingredients into a folder with special headlines / footprints a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / footprints.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context-click menu (show right mouse button) on a complete command collection for adding the folders, or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & HTML text editor, which can be accessed through the menu view. the first mode replaces the source code editor through the VPL; -Editor and the Zweite entry into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works as follows: he invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -side and an cursor appears. then you can edit it and when needed for the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; -Editor in source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document that includes & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; -source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; -Editor. to edit it, the source text editor is necessary. there are no plans to change these behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first one, except that the changes are visible in the source code editor and in VPL; -Editor synchron is running. with wigaps of F9, this mode is already active, this mode is already active, the active cursor from one window to another, where the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The syncing balance between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor is adjustable about settings Quanta; according to choice of VPL; you can automatically select between synchronisation after a click or automatically. in principle the recommendation is available: a small margin for fast computers and a large margin for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the toolproperties tab is possible to choose. that is the processing of invisible tags in working with the VPL; -Editor will also be called once a new document with the VPL; -Editor will also be created. this serves the reduction of the Kurdish codiment. so that one can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags will provide the storage of information about the document itself e.g. key words for internet search engines. a click into the list allows the change of content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key works2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to designing sites in the browser. you can add CSS-rules with the buttons under the list or delete. a change on the list is exactly as possible with the meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules are currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style, by pressing on the file button, and choosing the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is like being in a text processing, through references to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is behaved as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted through inserting or removed.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same way via the toolbar, as seen in the HTML-text editor. it's worth note that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. if an anchor tag, surround with text must be removed any other reversed anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are downlighted. you will be later in & VPL; work in this release must be used the tables or lists of the toolbar.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. why? so & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The interperformance was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time it had corrected a lot of changes at the same time. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts to merge together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">That was used by me only changed the modified lines, but I could not see what changed precisely within these lines. and there was no indication of the places, where perhaps only the impart had changed. this change was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could present differences within one line and changes to white signs. later, all amount of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you wish to compare an example quick text, just copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the evenly windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; nearly into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-Way together is fully supported. this is useful when two people will work independently of a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and shows simultaneously the result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files to merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the comparisons and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder-merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences in and thickens the possibilities of today's control monitors. if you need to verify cogs, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed clearly. if rows are only in a certain number of white signs, one can see a look at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble if someone and the import changes.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is identical and the other is different in a row, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but you are in different folders, then you can simply complete the type-work by using only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder, folder, kdiff3 folder, kdiff3 folder, kdiff3 folder 3 kdiff3 folder, folder 2 folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open-dialog allows the manual typing data stream, the selection using the file browser (file...) or the selection of a recently opened file from the popup. you need to specify a third file; if you do not have the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons and merge subfolders automatically. if for A file is selected, for B and C, however, one folder, then used & kdiff3; the filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If together, the input field is active, the input field is active for the purpose and can be dealt with. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately set out a output file. you can get this step later on the memory.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start with the comparisons / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag Texttments from the clipboard to the active particle windows. comparison begins then immediately. in Open dialog, you don't have to select files you can simply connect the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also run pulling and drop out: drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes it includes a file such as several similar features. if you want to find out how similar to these functions are, it would create a relatively large effort. you would need to create two relevant files, they can copy in & kdiff3; and then you can easily copy the relevant sections just copy, and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can not pull nothing of & kdiff3; only the pitfalls of text into a comparison of window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and drop of text into another program than Excision and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box there is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C) has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse a while on the line. then a small aid window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three code readers are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu).</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees in the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default colour is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left along with the text there is the summary column. when differences were found, the column signifies the corresponding color. when different programming languages the color is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, e.g. are white signs only in character and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that divides the composition column, is interrupted in the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the tick-file is enabled, the line is shown at the curved lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison) has also a info line with the wording edition:, the filenames and [changed] when you have processed the result. usually it contains the automatic transmits already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! up to all conflicts are dissolved, the memory is disabled!!! (use the buttons Jump to nights / unsolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "" "" "when only two associations can be used, each difference is simultaneously a conflict which must be solved manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows that appears to be shown in one of the windows the first line of the group is indicated, and the first line of the group will not be shown.) This group will then be the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic transmissions or by manuelles there will be no more line left in the group; then there is only a wildcard for the event that you change your mind and perhaps yet another source. this text does not appear in the final file, nor in a markings which you might copy and fit elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; seductions; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources, ignore the options required or igned ignorance C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the image run and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the windows, you can use the arrow buttons on the left, right, top, end, finish, Strg-beginning and Strg-end, siw as you can also use it from other programs. the Overroll column can be used next to the vertical plane.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Augabefenster you can also use the other buttons for working. with the paste button you can switch between the insert and overload mode. (default is the entrance mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the start of the respective group (as stated in the section as in the section) and the editable ejector has been explained.</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrg-picture upward) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl image below) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl image below) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, between the solved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings into the clipboard, you need to press the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrg insertion). if this enabled, whatever you mark, automatically to the clipboard copy and copy the manual copying. be careful with this option but careful, because you could not accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenenden are saved according to the underlying system. Unix flavors use a tick pre-feed characters\, and Win32-based systems use Wagenenvorschub\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the tick-end of source files not, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last files used will be automatically saved and in the next startup. (Menu Settings- &gt; KDiffuser...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also contains fonces with variable width to choose from, you should not use this however.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">Once you activate this option, differences are shown in recursive script. if the chosen script does not support this representation doesn't happen at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colours, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be replaced. on these systems the button presets automatically displays an unmatched colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, the appropriate number of space buttons, is inserted in the appropriate number of spaces. otherwise, a tulator sign is added.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press or return, the insertion of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. you copy the manual to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which tick-type you prefer to save. the preset value is the generally common selection on the operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparisons of files tries & diffuse 3; first, all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white signs are not ignored. also during merging, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a wallet tip '\' at the end of a line, others, but then store files with different sizes on page-side comparison, although they are different. if this option is activated, wagencklly are treated, but as a white character may be treated. during which, this option must be deactivated. in the preset, this option is downlighted.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In preference, this option is downlighted. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the outcome, the differences are still indicated, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In preference, this option is downlighted. changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively for even smaller submissions. the option is activated in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic transmission mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next unsolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solving automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file being used as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white signs are used in many files less important. if you only take this from time to time, then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are not ignoring or ignoring C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in chapter on scanning of folders and run through a meeting. look for details under documentation for directory comparing and conduction.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already a older version exists, the original version exists the Suffix .orig. if already there is such a backup.id file with the Suffix .orig, this will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to end and launch, so that the change will be active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set out globally across the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following codes can be set for each entry separately. if you activate this option, you will use the upper settings for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The code-selected fields for coding appears a short notice, which is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has for you purely information.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this affects how special characters can be handled and interpret. as the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and combined with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding to be used to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define Vorverarbeitungscommands, they may not work with your codec. (e.g., your files can be 16-bit Unicode, but the device commands can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can set the coding of the output of screencommands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this to push the highlighting of changes in white signs in the text or review page. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are not igned or ignoring C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is available only when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences appear in a colorfully codified column column. but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files. however; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is shown next to the normal still a second over-column column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the space on the screen for long lines. blends you simply the less important window. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparisons to each other or to each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the conduction and use the filename of the last source file as a preset name for the output file. (when this function is used to launch it, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first be given to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own prelessor, which is exactly your requirements. you can use this function for example for cut trouble-cut parts or to rectightening.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is given first to this external command (see above), then the output of the command will only be used when wearing this preview. you can write your own prelessor, which matches your own requirements. each input line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program requires, and most users would not want to program. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this screenrest warrant for filing to convert: sed's /\\ (. *\\)\\\\ (. *\\)\\\\ (. *\\)\\ 1 / 'The\\ 1 in the first Klammerncouple. the\\ U converts the found text in large letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other Versionary systems use some keywords (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern of $keywords\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiffus. gsed's / [0123456789,-] / / g 'jeder character of' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, thus quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several settings at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use slightly different such as perl. perl -p's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allerdings include in perl some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal Preprocessor is maintained for viewing and to merge together. further operations change only the data that the zeilenabed-algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal Preprocessor, the second processor command will see the output of the normal Preprocessor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The emasessor are very useful, but as with any function, the text is altered or sometimes hidden, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit programmers in a folder many files. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder rekursiv.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for every object a proposal to merge together; you can adjust the proposal before the start;</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the simulated and show the simulated changes without it really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... results selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons, and merge different files very similar. you just have to specify a folder in the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folder is merged, folder 1 is used as the basis. if no target folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as target-folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not merge the merge, you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F7 button. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will receive a little news window over the current progress. if you abort the scan of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scan of the folder is complete, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Every file and a folder of the scan found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually displayed together. you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click or using the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory menu features two features all subdirectories and all subdirectories listed using which you can catch all the folder and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you click on a file, the file has started and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the data type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the compositions can not be automatically selected. if that will be merging, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder are considered as identical if its entire content is identical. then you have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for his color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a paper, which is only green, then yellow is and later when it is old, red is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy from B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. if A one folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A one folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronise is active if only two folder and no explicit introductions were specified and when the option directories are synchronized, then select & kdiff3; the necessary action to be identical to both folder. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user looks as visible filenames for the output file only B; direct after running, copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders will be merged and select the new file instead of session (insecure) then examines & kdiff3; the date of files are different, but the date is identical. if the files are identical, but the date is identical.. As such errors are not eliminated, the file cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge one file has been completed after another. it's status column shows fertious when the collapsing was successful, and according to other messages if something expected to be completed, you should make a last check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When the filtering dialog is selected by the comparative method, KDiffuser will display further columns. these contain the number unsolved, resolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts will only appear if three folder is compared or combined.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either match the selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the compositions that are selected (also in all subfolders), you can start it together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified any target folder, then in the three-folder mode C as the target, B as a destination is chosen and synchronise, A and / or B is used as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries are in the target folder, you may also be displayed in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring all the entries together: select directory together / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keysheet). to run only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory file types still invalid actions exist, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialogue window will appear with the options run, simulate and abort.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulate if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions necessary with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge an individual file), then opens up a pop-up window (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file folder, then select directory and press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialogue will appear. then, & kdiff3; his work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you'll see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem. so you have the option to choose another promotion for entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with it.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been customized, see themselves & kdiff3; this entries (in the current session) and results in later combined all of the entries, not again. even if this entries had been completed or not saved, these entries are considered settled. only if you change the merge action, these entries are once again combined.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...) now has a section named Directory meeting with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit in the specified sample are displayed in the Elementtree. separate the patterns associated with a semicolon;. valid placements: '*' and '?'. (e. g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folder must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not shown in the Elementtree. it can be added more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separators. valid placements: '*' and '?'. preset is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not shown in the Elementtree. it can be added more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separators. valid placements: '*' and '?'. preset is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autematic generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be set specific with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a verse attribute. in other filesystems have marks a preceding point. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is switched in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is off, symbolic links are compared. when the option is switched, the files are compared to which the links show. this is downlighted in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When left on folder: if the option is off, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is switched, the links like normal Folder will be treated and recursive. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible record intervals, and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Introduces a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and essentially slower if it is applied to files that contain no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folder via a slow network, it is possible to compare only the amendment date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of safety. please be used with caution. this option is folded in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Like familiar the changelist date. there's no real comparison. the files are considered as the same if they are equal. e.g. when copying the amendment date. please be used with caution. this option is switched in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the syncing mode if two folder is compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the proposals are identical to merge in. also, the results from the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action. (this will be considered uncertain as it is assumed the knowledge that the other file was not changed too. you should check this in any case.) This option is off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted, then the original version will be recycled and gets the extension .origine If an old backup file with the .orig -extension is already existed, so this without further backup will be cleared. this also applies to the normal merge of individual files, not just the merge whole folder. this option is switched in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder-merge view is visible to the window display of individual files visible; you can switch the window pone with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the window folder & text window, you can switch headwindow in the window-menu and turn off through change between directory & text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply using a double-click menu. however, you can have to merge a single file also directly, without having to merge the result, the status will be completed and the file will not be combined again if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you check the directory again: list -menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports networking with the help of KIO Slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folder for opening, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a ftp-server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed file with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">One URL has a different syntax as a local files and a folder. a few things should you consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">One path can be relatively un. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters have to be mashed. (# - &gt;% 23, vacation- &gt;% 20, etc.). for example has a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by using the protocol. it follows a short list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link on a file or a folder shows. then a file is accepted as a link-target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit authorization or change date. therefore, soft the authorization or change from the original. (consider the option familiar to the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of the reference purpose is currently the differences-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first always the built-in differences in the viewer. to kick KDiff3, press the right mouse button of the different viewer and then select In KDiffusPart, from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, when it is applied as a coffin format. it derives & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, the program patch starts to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the conqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiffuser preview. besides, this is unreliable when the original files since generating the patch file have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons between two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the combined or the same of folders gets not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiffuser (well Heist it compare) already exists. besides, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL-programs for quite a long time and have learned a lot by going into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone through this way or going to go like this.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably does not have the correct prefix to KDE released. in the default configure / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the interface. (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs is different, these lines are first treated as identical; but if only a non-white sign is treated differently, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines, next to each other, this one is, but this is, the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor realises for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends. that's needed to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source text and selecting the Knopfile A / B / C. however, this important information goes out, however, if the result is simply stored as text file and it's so much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has so far been too large. you can restore a certain version through selecting a source A / B / C. order to process larger amounts of text should be created another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src linulated; released and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already used many colors to highlight of difference. even more highlighting would be confusing and don't miss the purpose. do not use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troublesies came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; use & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest modifications can be found at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / changelog or in the file changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system to be installed in the KDE. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">As & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems at compiling. nevertheless difficulties occur, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or switching) copies the marked text. insertion (Ctrl-V or switching) adds the text from the clipboard at the current cursorrow, and replacing the current markings.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences appear: files that are identical in all folders appear not in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you have to update any changes to these options the folder with the function updates.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">It will only display entries that have shown differences. this also leads to that identical files will not be copied into the target folder. if the target folder does not already contain them, they are missing after the target. (the behavior will probably be amended in a later program version) This option is off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selection of the source with the marking A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached from the appropriate window to the end of the selected group (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be present on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In preference, this option is downlighted. Underdifferences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpcamp; shows a minipreview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop to change its size, ending them or move it. this works both inside a desktop and at several.</seg>

<seg id="2604">If you have at least set up a spokesman, you can start the voice output from & kde; click on the cardboard box General to open this map. here you can set some general options.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Highlight this Angizfeld for activating the & ktts; it starts off the KDE-TTS-Service (KTTSD). this start is successful, the card-card orders will be displayed and you can create text messages and read it. see. remove the markings, KTTSD will be halted and the TTS-System of & kde; disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2606">If kttsmgr is completed, runs & ktts; continue, provided the field language version (KTTSD) is lit.</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is this Angizfeld marked and kttsmgr appears in pre-read automatically in the control area of the checkout, it disappears once the pre-read is complete.</seg>
<seg id="2608">With the buttons in this series you can launch text entries, abort and resume.</seg>
<seg id="2609">With the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the & kde; -clipboard, or open a text file for reading. you can also switch the speaker for an order.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Click to apply or OK, then all changed settings are taken on all sides.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The card-card orders will only be displayed when KTTSD was started. to launch KTTSD, click on the map-down General and crossed the language version (KTTSD).</seg>
<seg id="2612">In & konqueror;, the navigator of & kde; you can preview the text of the displayed web page. check first, whether & ktts; running, then select the text that is pre-read, and select in the main menu tools text. after a short time the voice should start.</seg>
<seg id="2613">It is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website. you can also skip this step but then many & HTML; -prestressing and other invisible brands are also pre-read.</seg>
<seg id="2614">In & Kate; the extended text editor of & kde;, you can preview text read out. check first, whether & ktts; running, then select the text that is pre-read, and select in the main menu tools text. then, the voice should start.</seg>
<seg id="2615">This also works when & Kate is embedded in other applications such as & eg; in & konqueror; or in & quanta;.</seg>
<seg id="2616">KNotify is the news system of & kde; you have notified the text of these messages also of & ktts; read the text of this news also.</seg>
<seg id="2617">In & conversation;, the IRC program of & kde; you can set up different types of messages; for example, you can notify you when in a IRC channel a message appears when your nickname appears; you can then read the IRC message text.</seg>
<seg id="2618">Supports a & D; -program KNotify, appears a menu item notices in the menu settings of this program. the possible settings for KNotify vary depending on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Filters for drawing coverage offer a good opportunity to correct and correct. the file kmail.xml, which sends to the supply of & ktts; is a good example. you are removed the tags and b from the messages that can be sent by email, and also the print / local / inbox as it can be assumed in most cases as assuming. read this too.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Filtering, text is edited, before going to the program Speech dispdispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace false-spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker, or to deal with certain shortcomings of language synthetics and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filters is it important to know how the program "Speech dispdispatcher works with a text. & ktts; sets four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Saaders has the highest priority. it is reapplied to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is pre-read, the continued orders will resume.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news such as & eg; processor becomes too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupting normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application used to read the news. during you & eg; a long text on a website can be read through & kmouth; have someone looking straight the room. & kde; -notifications are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple textbox. each order that you encounter from the map orders, is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text entries. text messages are intended for issuing longer, which have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are performed in queue, except the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen Readers, during & ktts; just such a reads, this edition will be raised and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters never apply to the output of screen Readers. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and texts, as well as on & kde; -messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. at the moment there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String-packers replace parts of a text by other text. they can specify either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is provided with predefined string containing text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better comprehensible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Conformations use an XSLT-File (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to convert to a different format. included in the supply of & XHTML; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker-filtering you can send orders depending on the content of the text, or depending on the program you send the text to & ktts; if you have submitted a female voice for example on the card holder, you can read text of KDE messages about it. see them.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which he is applied to a language task. if the filter does not apply that its rules may not exist, the text remains unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text message, a message, warning or a button; sent to e-mail; sent by all the activated filter, which is placed on the page below. the processing by the filter is made in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This indicates the list of the standard normal filters. a filter is not lit, it is not activated and is not used. filters are currently downwards from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will be shown further below the following setup dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the set of string filtering filters, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative pattern. these patterns are changed in the text, the text is exchanged for the associated spare text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Indicate your filter a name. this name can select arbitrarily, it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filter.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the string in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is shown in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the distinctive phrase or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file that will save the current list or delete. download a list from file to the available list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Here is a language included, the filter is applied only when the spokesperson speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. click on the button to see a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages when you click the mouse-click the & Ctrl; key pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is registered here, the filter is applied only when the text comes from one of the indicated applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application-ID run programs will be obtained with the program qdbus; the & DBus; -numbers you need to leave. if for example & qdbus; the application ID Kopete-3432, you can only enter it.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string filtering filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if all the input cells are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When compared to words the string filter-filter regulator uses in the form\\ s word\\. the words must therefore be limited by crossover.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this handbook you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have the & kde; -Editor & # 160; expressions, you can call him in the dialogs or work as help to assemble this expressions. the & kde; -Editor & # 160; outlet & # 160; expressions can be found in the ambiguous package.</seg>
<seg id="2649">& XML; -Defformer translate & XML; using XSLT files from a format into another format. xslt (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such reversals. but it can only be applied to well-shaped XML. the help program xsltproc must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc can be reached via the ambient variable PATH, also sufficient xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker filter, you can send text to a certain speaker, set up on the cardboard card, or to a speaker with certain properties. you can specify for example that text by kmail is to be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & kton; a text attached to the filter, it looks a spokesman for the text. the spokesman will tell the text that sends the text, and the properties of the speakers selected on the map. with the speaker-filter, you can write the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is registered here, the filter is applied, if the text contains the given regular expression. is on your system of & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; expressions, you can call this with a click on the button to get help with the input.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Set here the properties of the requested meeting you need. if the text meets the above filter conditions, the spokesman selected is selected for the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to display the dialog language selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to store or download your speaker settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The spokesman-filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if you apply at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice-task API, von & kde;, with the programmers to lend their applications TTS-capabilities. applications communicate with KTTSD via & DBus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, with the lingusynthesizer can be added to KTTSD, so that you can use this synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section contains a brief description of & kde; -DBus; interface of the language version API of & kde;. the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the kde; Accessibility Website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of above languages can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, you can see the description of synthesizer to the supported languages at rate. see also on the website of ktts;, according to information that is not yet in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The program "Speech-dispatcher" uses a adaptable module-architecture for voice synthesizer. if you want to expand your use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; but it is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compiling; to compile, you need a current development environment by KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including the packages of kdeliverb and the wrist files for the program "Speech dispdispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you refer to the source texts from & ktts; from the source text archive for kdeed or downloaded the tarball for each night, install and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you start & ktts; use first, check first if spech dispatcher works correctly with your language synthesizer. this allows you to use the shell scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; 4.4 is the first version of Speech dispdispatcher. the program kttmsgr is supposed to be further developed so that the set up of Speech dispatcher is directly possible and the SDP is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text will be discarded into individual phrases. the user can repeat propositions or descend, repeat, keep the output or abort.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application text on & kton; skip, you can specify a female English speakers for example. if you have set up an speaker, whose language English and its gender is female, this will be automatically chosen the best suitable speaker. if you want to know more about how & dictates; a spokesman chooses, you will see in after.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click on the map-card speakers, and thereby insert a speaker to the list or click on it, the card holder tab will display. as an example, the module of the module for Interactive festival is shown below. details on the modules can be found under.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival in PATH is included, you just need to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text, who will be handed over to festival. in voices, the & ktts; well-known, this setting will be automatically made. generally speaking, Western-languages ISO 8859-1 use, comforting languages like Czech or Slovak, use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you put volume, listening speed and toning of the synthetic language. if you can not select some regulator and can be displayed this grey, the voice you choose has not chosen these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded multiple seconds due to their size. if you mark this Angizfeld, these voices are already loaded upon the start of KTTSD, so that (on greatest memory consumption) the first set is synthesized.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this crosswise you cannot be selected, you have not yet been set up an speaker (or simply click to apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">Is this crosswise marked, is displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start only the symbol kttsmgr is visible in the system window, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">Is this Angizfeld marked and kttsmgr still does not expire, it appears in the system area, once KTTSD appears to read a text. this gives you the possibility to read it or to control it otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all orders listed in queue, along with the application that has set the order has set the current status of order, the number of propositions and the currently working set. the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card holder.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series you can drop a double-circle in the order that is selected in the list below, pre- or go back. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">By clicking on OK will be taken over all changes in settings (even on the other map cards) and kttsmgr is reduced to the symbol in the system section. then click on this symbol to display the program window again.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts; not installed, but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click on the map audio. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Here are only text messages listed and managed. issues of screen Readers, warnings and messages are not displayed. additional information on the news types of & ktts; find in.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Select here the type of audio data. if a component can not be selected, it was compiled; either without support for the appropriate audio module compiled or rektts; the necessary libraries can not load.</seg>
<seg id="2699">If ggle or aKoc can be used for the audio output, select here the audio output. if no initial deposit module can be displayed on the list, you have to install at least one module. do you have ALSA selected, choose the PCM device.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Ask the interphone speed here. 50nbsp;% corresponds to approximately half and 200nbsp;% about the double normal intercom speed. thus these settings can be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click to apply the new settings for the current & server system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices covers all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you need to find out which device works with you. in doubt, choose standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map, you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text message is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it will be raised all other orders and keeps these orders. after the output of the screen reader has been read, the added orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the closest priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Breaking news have the next priority. a message interrupting normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just have a long text on a website read, you can move with & kmouth; nevertheless someone looking at the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text message is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen Readers, adds & ktts; the audio handover into queue a bit.</seg>
<seg id="2708">These audio file is always played when a normal text function is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message is active, the introductory sound is deducted before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map apply only for normal text messages. for news, warnings and expenses of screen Readers, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; KNotify-messages forward, start kttsmgr and click on notifications. the map card notifications appears.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Highlight this Angizfeld in order to switch to the read & kde; -benches. this setting is not marked, the remaining settings are disabled and cactts; reads no notifications.</seg>
<seg id="2712">This setting marks, will be notifications in which a sound is played, of & ktts; not read out.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it. if you click on the button Add, a dialog, in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message before, the & conversation; sent when someone refers in a IRC message to your nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which in the list is nothing else stated, are by & ktts; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this selection field to determine what's going to do when an event occurs. you have the following options:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected the defined text you specify the text you want. you can use the following wildcard:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the properties of the desired microphone. default select the speaker, which is displayed in the list on the cardboard card as the top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if a particular event is specified for a certain application, it will be executed. otherwise the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application. as the last resort the action is set to wearing, which is under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All notifications for the application standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list). for this you can define the notification alerts as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the button save to store the settings for the notification in a file. use the button store to load stored settings from a file. if you want to begin with an empty list, click Delete. all entries are deleted. all entries are deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice delivery. this standard contains trademarks for controlling the voice, the voice of voice and toning. also brands for controlling the pronunciation by example abbreviations. SSML is a part of VoiceXML specification, a further W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partly and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the Rab _ diphone voice (british male) as this is the default voice, the festival used in the version of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">When the settings for speed or toning in the festival-configuration dialog does not count on 100nbsp;% is set, SSML text usually is very monoton spoken.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; Who has slept in my bed? asked dad Bär. who lived in my bed? asked Mama Bär. who lived in my bed? asked the Bärenkind.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and statulimitenerated filter (SDSc filter). SBDs add text into individual sentences. thus, the first phrase does not need to read more quickly, not the whole text order. thus, you can also stop beaten or stop or stop and abort, even if the language synthesizer, this is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the statuity scaling filter. at the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up as a set of statute cell filters. you can change its settings or add further statutes to the typing filter, but beginners will get off.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the simplest you learn the setting of speech selection by trying. switch off the speech selection, which Speaker & ktts; decide on the selection, change some properties and check how to select the selection of the speaking people. of course, you have to have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is uneffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& kton; then begin to start reading, since only the first phrase has to be processed and not the entire text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then hold text messages on the card-card orders or abort, even if the voice synthesizer this function is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal stato-cell filter is automatically established, if you start tcgr for the first time. it can not be off, only change it. do not change anything about this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Proposing scaling filters compare text with a regular expression for statute and add a table (decimal number 8) to the stator limits (tabulated characters are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard set-by typing filter is retained the character enactment.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-filters are never applied to & kde; -News (rewind), warnings, news or the output of screen sails.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from understanding the normal statute filter, you can insert this again by loading the contained file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map-selection, you can write the speaker settings for the application. the map card will be shown when</seg>
<seg id="2737">The default code (the top on the card holder). in other words, there are no speaker features.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate intercom devices that displays all the properties of an equipped microphone. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the intercom. otherwise, choose & dictts; the spokesman, the most commonly featured features correspond to.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired language properties, by clicking on one of the options.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the properties of the desired speech. if this property does not play a role, do not give anything else.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Highlight this Angizfeld, if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also use multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Because the language is a critical factor when comparing the issue, it will always be treated as a priority feature. you will never use this property. the only case in which you might want to provide the attribute language, if you know that certain application text will be displayed in a different language than that in the work environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the area of speaker, which corresponds to the verifs below, click on the selection of the default, click on speaker, which corresponds to the following hereinafter.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 for the last text order in the queue, you can also specify a order number. (no order number is needed 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr goes immediately when it is started. I have compiled debug support, but I do not get any feedback.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and calmed; it was finished. probably you have to register GStreamer 0.8.x is the command GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not resolved, it is possibly a non-compatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to update or install GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio handover of ALSA does not work if at the same time I stop playing with another application of music. if I get a text order, freezes & kton; a message appears on the & console; appears a message: "to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system the problem is to develop conflicts at ALSA, which can prevent a simultaneous display of multiple PCM devices. information on possible solutions can be found on the website of ALSA Project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have loaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I installed them and can use them in festival, but kttsmgr showing this voice not.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Insert in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / Voices the new voice. as guide you can serve the other entries. if that's successful, please send a patch together with the & URL; in which you have found the voice to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the map audio there is a setting speed. so this works, the program has to be installed as x installed and through the environment variable PATH. some synthesizer sounds like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the talk speed are ignored if & dictts; & HTML; (this is because the HTML will be transmuted in SSML.)

<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware can not install. physical devices and their drivers have already been functioning and configured, with that & knetworkconf; the device ever indicates and the setting of network properties possible.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed at the Installing of & Linux; using and installed and installed. networks will be added later, the driver must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the core version, to be loaded:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings will be loaded when the option network settings is selected at & kromcenter; -index selected. at the start of the Mods network settings, this system will automatically detect the platform using the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized is the most important selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release date is best suited. by flagging the setting Not-again questions the definition can be taken permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically defaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The modifying of the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode. previously, all options are described only, meaning that change can only be considered, changing the changing system mode by clicking the button lower right at the lower end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system-system mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The mobile network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are shown. by the semen network, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings-lined network interface can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up the button.</seg>

<seg id="2837">This will be recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile, the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on fundamental power technology will be given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; changeable configurations.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace additional knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the integration of the PC is conveyed in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4) is currently operated. IPv5 has never been found great prevalence. by IPv6, it is expected to penetrate it in the near future. this description is currently focusing on the IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to note which IP-address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, am & eg; workplace is the contact point, which may be used a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be easily selected.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a own little (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specially designed for this purpose in order to avoid IP address data using the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not passed on the internet, therefore their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up a Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, most addresses are usually used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is big for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the network mask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the Zweite die loopback-address (localhost = its own computer). the default route is required for the IP redirecting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The mains address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the reproduce, the files must be restored, which can be restored. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the bandwagon. it will be restored only the selected file or sub-folder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Highlight the files you want from one of the archives to a tick. you will only be restored the files marked as well and / or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives, and select in the menu re-establish menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog settings for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for the restoration.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to regenerate the band's indexfile with the right content. this operation clears all the existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This gives you a backup profile with the precisely marked files and the standard settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working conditions in which the backup should be carried out. the list of fileering files will be automatically updated according to the selected employment folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the folder, which are listed under hedging files, that only those files are stored in the same filesystem, such as the folder. the folder that are stored on other filtering files, you can enter separately under the backup files. each entry is determined by tar independent from the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have been modified since the last indifferent backup, a snapshot file is saved. only the files are assured that have since changed since.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the final incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file in front of the call of tar. this causes all files backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files are; and lt; files were not completely implemented in the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can set you up on the menu item KDat... set in the Settings menu. the following settings may be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path for device file (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-remodelling variant of the bandplace.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & terminous; before the volume is integrated, the command will be automatically transfered to the drive. with some drives, this is necessary before reading or reading operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched, tries to lock the accusation; the accusation to lock in the bandwagon. maybe this setting does not work with all the bandworks.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched, the lovelous of incorporation of & kdat. automatically the belt is kicked. use this option for floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option enabled, tries to change the hardship; the hardship block allows for the bandwagon. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must provide & kdat. in any case you have to communicate the block size for your bandwagon.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat: a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the string. this file should be loaded only one memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this character string is bername: seconds, the inname of the complete name of the system is formatted on which the belt has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds, which has passed since the epoch where the belt was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to use a file containing the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files in the tape are pure tar -archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup bank. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& kszentlog; is a & killer; -viewers can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files. additionally users allow quick access to information on issues related to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& kszentlog; helps users to understand what your computer makes inside the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system, or where the system is deposited the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Moreover, & ksystems log; experienced users access rapid access to information on issues related to their server. & ksms log; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions, using their help the protocol-files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksms log; a number of useful features. among other things, include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, displays & ksms log; functions available, using whose help the individual protocol-lines of a protocol file can be easily filtering and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & ksms log; first to open the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol is opened, so you will not have a little news window, so you have not started with systemswalterright. the protocol files can usually be found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no justification to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter a string into the filter bar. the list of the log file is now automatically changed, so that only a log file contains the entry in addition to the filter entry. then a log file contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of filters is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select a different entry at this point. select the string file. select for example in the filtering file system. select for example in the filtering file system. select the name of a process, so shows you & kszentlog; all protocol lines sent from this process or were created respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level errors are indicated with a striking colour as a protocol-lines of the level indicator. the colored display of protocol-lines may be off-cutting dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to view only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can then be useful when you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to make new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kszentlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate undergo. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol on display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& kszentlog; has its own website on http: / / kszentlog.forum-software.org. Dort you can find further information about the sources of the supply of & Co.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kszentlog; also you can find in the following the folder of & kde; -Subversion archive: kszentlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; system V init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section runs some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V init develops quickly to the standard for controlling the program starts at the top of the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD controller.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to put a machine on System V init without a reinstall and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel sees first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you will need to continue the old init from there if there was one there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.Quinit and the following further folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you want to boot at the top of the system or when moving to a different runlevel. system services contain such things as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not contain such things as settices, which only once started. such views belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even though it does not have much use for it. you can also add a rc.qin / etc / rc.d if you want to run out at the top of what has to do with the standard connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching at different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column, and probably determine that the preset runoff is 3. if you want to change this, then you can perform / etc / inittab. if you have got a mistake, then you will get repaired by starting the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right script? if you enter's -l enter into rc3.d, then you will probably see something like that:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start this script in hand on the command's command:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if a K contains, the script with the argument stop is called. if he includes an S, the script is called using the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; ein server -runlevel have, that's only httpd, & sendmail;, network and etc. furthermore, I could also have a user -runlevel, that & win; & kdm;, Network & etc..</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; use a mouse or another character is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of control system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts among Runleveln or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere. here, the entry is removed from its original Runal (or its position). this happens only if they get a entry from the range of control system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed when you put them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runal, you must explicitly select copying from the menu or select from the context menu -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorption number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting items of the surrounding entries before you can once again try to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no possibility to reproduce entries which were thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to enable the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) and the cursor buttons, to meet a selection of superficial or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another Runal (you can also drag it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorrow number, or the name of an entry manually, press the button button to switch to the Properties dialog. use the tabulator button to switch between different fields. enter the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to manipulate the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of the data entry, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preference becomes the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are stored by & ksysv; restored. changes to presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine starts consistently new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Specify at LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to launch in the sole user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel at a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; intended for execution under Runal X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in this distribution. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way to run system services in these distributions are simplified the configuration for proprietary incorporating programs of this distributions but unfortunately not a standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use a different distribution: please check if all the configuration files are present (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply complete without a message when their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the Runal level, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made modifications, you must save it. either you use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry to save the file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, user interface and user list. to Edit, select the desired users or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user interface or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cardboard cards are shown only when you have enabled administrative restrictions (Quota) to be activated, a map card will be created if you are able to make individual settings, if shadow -passcodes or example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD Unices.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map-card password appears, if shadow -passcodes or example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD or Unices.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card-card appears only if for at least one built-connected file constraint (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable on the file quota.user / quota.group at the filesystem). here you can modify parameters for each user, the space restrictions are stored in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the array of a filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map groups informs about the group related to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field Primäre group. furthermore, the user can mark member in other groups by setting them in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click on the matching Add-button of the toolbar. the Edit or Delete of the selected users or the selected group will be analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO System, remove the boot password, remove and modify the time to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, modify, modify, change and more.</seg>
