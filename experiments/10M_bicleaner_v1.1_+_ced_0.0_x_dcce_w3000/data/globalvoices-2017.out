although I visited the US for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American music was read about American music and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American movie journalist .
when 14 @-@ year , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terri@@ fied re@@ porter , who covered the su@@ preme conspir@@ acy of an oil magn@@ ates , who had the top@@ most con@@ federation with judges , who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only strengthened .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very black@@ ish love hearing about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most exceptional aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he goes down with its bot@@ t@@ iness .
he never stops in his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he tells exactly what he thinks of , as a former colleague it expresses , and explained publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ cans and women .
nevertheless people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million voices which he won with the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number , who reached a nomin@@ ate candidate from the party .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ zy person , I asked me ?
I couldn &apos;t get Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , the people from all over the world , a deep believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also , the m@@ umps of the world@@ view did not coinci@@ de with the present by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Sun &quot; at the game .
m@@ umps Int@@ ol@@ ance also stands in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced with Sandy B@@ ahr who fought for their lives for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family that treated me like their son .
still she fits into the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then we were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise Council helped me a lot with my career .
these people and the values are em@@ bo@@ died through them my love of America .
while wearing his way to the nomin@@ ate Republi@@ can presidential race , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps especially because of its cont@@ emp@@ t toward non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for wearing , because they either shared its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart .
maybe it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as a rac@@ ist .
to as@@ sign the people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their villages are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom have been tun@@ ed for Tr@@ ump because they want to recover the control of a country that has disappointed ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one cannot forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented the cru@@ el decision to rise up a man who looks up with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look differently from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ di@@ m . SC . : as much as &apos; drawing of wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &apos; ; word@@ play made of white in reference to the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash what so much does like Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as was the big Van Jones , exactly what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world cher@@ ish the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nonetheless a powerful idea - what belief or background you may have always like , America is most welcome .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of an identi@@ fier , its history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , is a huge part of the White America of this promise and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The hell of diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in America , after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the ruin , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word@@ change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a sound &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gro@@ mm@@ ed the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have Latin inos a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; rep@@ lied it .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called for their voices and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; could anyone who is not how you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an un@@ anim@@ ous and voc@@ al &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded by the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and that brings me my heart .

what has the Mexican music @-@ school of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music that is played on both places not only has changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music which lives with the fall
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is situated on the edge of a big gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now , La B@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has now played in the municipality : one out of children and adults in the existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orch@@ est@@ ras , with their music instruments a way to overcome its surrounding poverty .
a school @-@ school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest province of Mex@@ ik@@ os , is famous for its drugs abuse and ban@@ anas violence .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered so rare hop@@ eless@@ ness .
the young band members take their obligations to the Musik@@ gruppe very seriously , says the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to im@@ itate their great passion .
they come and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the bust@@ ling you learn day for trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , ob@@ oe , flute , fore@@ horn , Pau@@ line , Bon@@ g@@ os and the con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the kids of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paragu@@ ay capital - on instruments that are produced from re@@ vit@@ alised waste material :
music with recur@@ ring instruments , which consist of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments at Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling headed by F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of apost@@ asy into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guitar , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made of the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the re@@ pertoire includes classic music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local Eco @-@ ologist and Musi@@ cians teaching the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura to the initial time :
first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ sing and we had to teach at the same place where the children did not have music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed to be a f@@ avi@@ o something that he never had seen before : one out of waste @-@ made violin .
today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments produced on instruments and that is called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance at :
the world produces approximately one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest people - like the men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectac@@ le from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music from the Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing .
this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports international , practi@@ cing solutions for environmental problems reported .
re @-@ release is done as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on the common use of content .
in West Africa , at that time , there was already known that this ship had already been operated in liberal waters of illegal fishing , before the other coast of Africa was rising .
the East African countries were accordingly raised , and little more incl@@ ined to welcome a legislative bur@@ gl@@ ars of this kind on co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the comp@@ ress@@ ors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised himself rapidly against the ship . they ref@@ ra@@ ined to him , one of their har@@ b@@ ours , and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refuse everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that was discovered and followed the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was comp@@ elled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to lo@@ wering the fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crimin@@ alizes practices and resources protects , FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 was founded by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing eries ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , which at that time had driven the prime minister off their waters .
&quot; we have eight countries that are like minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project ending illegal F@@ ishing . this project provides FISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , what is extremely difficult to enable . in this way , illegal fishing is a major event of the over@@ fishing of regions .
by the int@@ enti@@ onal de@@ cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may have its delicate equilibrium .
but while actions against illegal fishing has been hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic obstacles and also through the sn@@ ail damage , with the information between individual countries , these actions occur in real time , with trac@@ e@@ ably to FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange lists together for example lists , news to di@@ gest activities or details , which one had noticed or experienced during a long@@ term prospects .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open lake through satellite formats .
this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , as suspected routes , such a ship suggest that a ship invites its captured fish on other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the way , and possibly also , whether they have a pen@@ al code .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can deny the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to be forced to claim sanctions , as in the case of prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a significant financial losses for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing trade is not worth making any more financial support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , intro@@ duc@@ tory Director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the already mentioned platform was created to attract 20 million USD in lost sales , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate in East African waters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , present for the region of commercial fish @-@ fishing from around the world . under these also illegal fishermen .
to their practices , including actions , such as sailing on false flag , f@@ ake license pap@@ iere , specification of Phant@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , the fish @-@ protected species and the fishing practices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are specifically using the missing international cooperation and make themselves the weaknesses of an incomplete control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illeg@@ ally fish and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t walk down my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ stri@@ l tries to close the FISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of demon@@ stran@@ gers .
it has revealed criminal networks who had f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent ident@@ ities and it has escap@@ ed ships and found .
due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to combat crimes , FISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over major distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that is supposed to help the FISH @-@ i more suspic@@ ious ships of precise locations .

Fish @-@ i &apos;s Satellite system that will always be developed , also helps to send illegal ships to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishing use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Editor @-@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , an N@@ RO , which also deals with fisher@@ y data and FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , some of the ships turn off for example its automatic in@@ denti@@ fication systems , which can no longer be produced by satellite .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that combines different information levels . it is supposed to help FISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
however , FISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence any influence on the un@@ question@@ ably global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ line has launched a platform to Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world by means of every single fol@@ dable ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - this is simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , where a global System allows the persecution of ships &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crime but they also cr@@ inge .
ships used to be fis@@ her without license and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , we now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in FISH @-@ i involved a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries rate , ever since fishing boats for more licenses .
after FISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 record , the inspec@@ tors found there on board the tow rope , whose use is forbidden .
photo with friendly permission of FISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also other countries notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa a year hundreds of millions of dollars by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there , 2015 six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also they are now fighting the illegal fishing , based on the same model as FISH # . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the goal of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia put his first great tri@@ umph : in October it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the wrong flag . and not just the ship was also used without a license and were used to tow .
the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the Take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they put a strong sign that they prec@@ ede against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such special , collabor@@ ative methods work on the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world sea . Emma Bry@@ ce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there they writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela sp@@ ans further into : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of reg@@ ain the country .
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the prosec@@ ution of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a se@@ aling of the demonstration in Marac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government was rejected by the opposition to the opposition to a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans had rejected the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the Le@@ ere that they gathered together on the streets .
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the return expedition ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the coastal area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located north @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva Esp@@ arta .
the political and economic situation of the country is deteri@@ or@@ ating continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a acute lack of food and medic@@ aments .
many representatives of the Opposition saw in the prosec@@ ution of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , the dra@@ in@@ age of a new election was blocked by official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting among Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , in its latest article disc@@ usses the context of the government &apos;s government as follows :
in the context of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate and ant@@ al@@ tr@@ ate has been estimated at the highest levels of food and medicine , the referendum for counter@@ ing and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine is considered to give the country the chance to con@@ quer its institutional structures and to join a new governance .
the elec@@ toral portrait of M@@ esa de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( e.g. : r@@ under table of the Democratic unity ) , called for the opposition to the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos; in which the opposition delegation was planned for the election of the National Assembly , called the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , on November 3 , the block@@ ade of the refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms should continue to continue .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

the first demonstration during the programme of Action &quot; The re@@ conquest of Bulgaria &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the images of the mar@@ ches , published in real time , witnesses among others a overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most commonly used images shows a demonstr@@ ator that calls through the patron saint &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter you can get pictures that tell about disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially large waves beat the message about police supp@@ ression in the central @-@ north town of Marac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to their own statement prior to the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , several protest@@ ers sought to keep the police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ ian T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry a tubes , because one could otherwise see something that many nationalities do not have !
meanwhile , an infection is already doing the round that forms the extent of repression per day :
so the dictatorship of the country has oppressed the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had the validity of the call for a counter@@ part procedure in question - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many thanks to the presence of countless people on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s contribution to this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the signat@@ ures are f@@ ake .
here is your counter@@ shooting !
in the street !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others consider these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government that has taken little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and prefer to deal with critical voices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches are getting more and more on frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they are hungry , in order to participate in a strike , rather than working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with the kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father , the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ian city Córdoba , to see .
as the meantime , the husband told Qui@@ j@@ ano now in the frame of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the Province of Cordoba against his father .
in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , who were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not look for his life .
starting at the Bür@@ de , same name as his father wear , to the brutal l@@ ament in the prison of La Per@@ la , he was watching enough in the age of 15 .
for 34 years he kept the family lon@@ gue for himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that was all right .
I felt like a secret .
when a child under the age of 15 cannot be seen that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was g@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ an . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father died from 1976 to 1978 Deputy Commander department , 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who realized the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy and who spoke before a Tribunal for his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base .
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I was wo@@ unded with a boy who made mar@@ ti@@ al sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend him .
he said :
you are an Ar@@ sh@@ ole , you made you with one of the ERP friends .
pass except that they will not cause you one day and then save you .
the Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ ti@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries of the Army of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my father had educated me .
on the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers that heard the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ pag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , just everything .

my dad took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first time and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he command@@ ed me to go out . he led me to a Bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - standing .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small piece of wick@@ ets and command@@ ed me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ot of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were dump@@ ed and taught me with an out@@ post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ ed into and saw a cr@@ adle , where people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a dirt @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later , I found out that they had attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who saw there fallen .

the rocks there penet@@ rate there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later , when my father was under house ar@@ rest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed . &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with hand thres@@ holds , and troub@@ les .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a letter that was also indic@@ ted in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying with the face down - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated in hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people are silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father re@@ marked that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thou sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I un@@ answered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and by soldiers killed and buried .
I know that because my father was home at home .
in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms , which were regarded as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck there a man and kill .
( according to information of survi@@ vor@@ s the civil is Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ( death ) .

the way in which you came here is also the way in which the kid@@ n@@ led came here .
when you look at the map , see that they took about this route and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here , their names were changed and they got al@@ located as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be imposed .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ ms - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ mare &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war design@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as it had called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was later on the military - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war@@ fare of the bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps a military sign , which one is fought for one enemy .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... well , then that is not a war but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always asked me how my father , the director of the security forces , could contribute to this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penet@@ rate into a house and to ste@@ al it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal , and I said , And thou that you saw cars on the road ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded in front of anger , struck me and cri@@ ed :
if you go so far , I will find you and bring you independently .
for this we do not need any others !
that was my father .
I have not only a good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time on which I contributed a jacket and a roller ho@@ oks from Wol@@ le . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence , a co @-@ con@@ j@@ ure in this crime had been to be . I dis@@ gr@@ aced , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
I was anyway there , to speak .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearances of cor@@ pse is the last vile act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel rep@@ ent@@ ance .
I have children . if one has only children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops on and reali@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I was even going to say so far :
good , so you have changed while the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children kid@@ n@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl with his home whose mother was killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
were these people not also families who could pass over their mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act which one can do to man .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced once , she fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the imm@@ ort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were sm@@ elled and anywhere else - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to get it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , showing my Father , was created during a conversation , when he was under house ar@@ rest .
I made him alleg@@ ations of all of the atro@@ cities that I had to experience on account of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I did not kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt ins@@ ulated and asked me , for the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; that they supp@@ os@@ edly defended themselves .
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell me what to say ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have horri@@ ble crimes committed and you forced me to participate as a child .
he insi@@ sts only &quot; Na then ho@@ g me . &quot;
this is what I did .
2010 I first saw the first ad .
I had finally recognised that he was a crimin@@ als .
nobody can imagine that I am pres@@ et . I finally said against my own father .

a translation mistake makes early people in Kyoto to &apos; fri@@ ght@@ less car drivers &quot;

editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driver , last month witnesses a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ko@@ rei@@ unt@@ en@@ sha ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ko@@ rei@@ unt@@ en@@ sha ) , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and # 82@@ 12 ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
execution of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine that were often shared in the social media .
the error was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a local inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local zeit@@ ungen .
the Kyoto writes in Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if gramm@@ ar is not the very correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture is ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation mistake . furthermore , they explained that the error was already included in the text they received from the transl@@ ator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was released .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt thanks to the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News is something more detailed by the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ fully &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police there is the proportion of older drivers that are nation@@ wide in accidents , but quite cause for concern .
in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 has been caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors increased in 18@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
so that their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the percentage of sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the name @-@ mentioned re@@ porter was brought in the comments on Yahoo released version of the article comments to light , which show the prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo demonstrated about the translation errors , among other things received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So the translation is not actually , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a true transl@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is widespread in all Asia
trans@@ lators are widespread in Japan and in Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ op for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide circulation of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
for over one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and communicate active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native language . in general the conviction that trans@@ lators is in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers .
in this way a French mother tongue transl@@ ator was translated into French by English - not by French .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue , translations into the English translation . this may not be attri@@ but@@ able to an understanding of the survival , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that will be Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees to make translations into the company internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best , for the transl@@ ator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the ver@@ ted and pu@@ zz@@ ling phr@@ ases which are developed by machine translations , demonstrate that this technique can not replace a human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to several languages quite particularly .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling p@@ prints which often uses T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for st@@ ili@@ stic reasons - not read or even understood .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translation .
the city of Kyoto uses in future hopefully a serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and ten@@ ens@@ ations to take on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ensa y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7th of April , ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an internet users would have no access to online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV was no longer accessible either .
other online radio station over@@ carried photos of protests in Car@@ acas , who were organised by the opposition groups who oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April , after the captain &apos;s court dis@@ solved the Parliament and took the task of the Parliament on the executive and the captain &apos;s court themselves .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the connection was k@@ issed , and recommended the U@@ sers , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your V@@ PN .
it seems that Internet sites of ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ischer provider will be closed again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reported in the coverage of protests in the past 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation were reported to them with money la@@ vers and finally , if they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; appeal to violence . &quot;
without cable television and informative national TV channels I op@@ ted me at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
astonishing that this is still cheaper than two lit@@ ers of lim@@ on@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay under a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two more online transm@@ itter . this also applies to the website to which the National Assembly passes its meetings .
previous research institutes of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS advantage . this is a technique that may respond to the DNS server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or deny the request when it comes to such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer on Thursday , April 6 , was adjusted as the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flores which carried live in cust@@ ody in Car@@ acas .
Flores was be@@ aten while he was in police force .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV continued to show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it is also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : the Venezu@@ el@@ ans of access to multi @-@ media coverage over the current events in the country is always increasing .
in Paraguay are many girls to slave to receive an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts witness to other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who have been the victim of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the ab@@ brevi@@ ated version of a report by Kur@@ tural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; V@@ acas que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lies cattle , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , in which they did not work together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
the one has become something , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga is never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as a cri@@ ad@@ itas , they are called in Paraguay that are more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to attend school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money over@@ comes her min@@ derer son or her child @-@ old daughter to another , plentiful family . in the exchange , the child receives food , training and one roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned yet is that children must do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract you cannot raise .
this is referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance of large sections of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
according to completion of their studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for a number of years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered , resear@@ ched and p@@ ayed .
she tried to call things on behalf of the name , as the sense of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ mean itas , is guaranteed to be silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ enga .
on the one hand , the family , who carry out their daughter in faith that she can so close their education to improve their position in society and can &quot; make something out of himself . &quot;
on the other hand , the family , which takes the girl in himself and justi@@ fies the exploitation of faith that they give someone a chance that would otherwise not get education and maybe even be star@@ ving .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mis@@ led , his family will only learn about many years later .
sometimes they never experience them .
in January 2016 , the still relatively unknown phenomenon which takes place in the Hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of severe mud . just after that she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Mil@@ ena Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as officials at the entrance hall .
Mar@@ ín was living in their house in V@@ aqu@@ ería , a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants and 250 kilometres to the east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira made up a stick with a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal inju@@ ries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
she stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the profound practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they recorded the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came to protest , and demanded that there are no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ enga .
without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for an immediate investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had their cri@@ ad@@ ita was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
when the case comes to judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be landmark - when the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s case .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
cri@@ mp are not only exploited as labour @-@ exploited , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when her father worked , he entered her father , and her father lost his work .
their brethren had to go all work and began to sell money on the road or on the market to make money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ enga worked out between four to six hours every day .
in doing so she had to share the time so that you still remained time to learn .
she stood up at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
fri@@ days for example cleaning the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more they finished with learning , the more leisure time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ enga says , she never had to hungry , but also didn &apos;t get un@@ bound@@ ed food . &quot; I was allowed to pick me more books from the library of the landlord than food from the fridge , &quot; she reminds me .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ etic of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
to some evenings of hous@@ eholder Al@@ var@@ enga , to stand in addition to him and to read editorial from Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ s@@ zeit@@ ungen as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade her to give the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he held them for intelligent , but did not believe with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who spoke , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would be learning there again &quot; poor habit . &quot; so they argu@@ ed that Al@@ var@@ enga that belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , home once again their native language Guar@@ an@@ í .
their Lord feared that she would have made her way of losing her again , explained them .
but she was perfectly clear that she got for everything she got from them , with their hard work .
also in the school Al@@ var@@ enga is discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about , are bullying and the bullying , which cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that anyone who has no parents , a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me at home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time , where friend@@ ships arise , I feel particularly clear that I was not one group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga .

in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group where you can view jobs for cleaning personnel and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .

in the course of our history we managed to explo@@ it systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a business system during the Spanish conquest ) , where the Spanish Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ adores ( a business system ) had to be subjected to their &quot; wives , &quot; the Spanish con@@ quer@@ ors ( a business system ) , where the Spanish con@@ quer@@ ors had to be referred to in Paraguay . therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys come into a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social inequality in Paraguay and the presentation of power are key to the understanding of the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .

&quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliament@@ arians recently voted for a bill to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law a place would be established , which is in charge of use citizens to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months with adoption of the law , users and users have to register on the site of the site with their right names and personnel instructions to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
will it failed to do this , so that could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a pur@@ bu@@ ck .
the bill that consists of six Par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fts and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which is run and used via the Internet , to communicate with other means , video sets and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law is en@@ forced when the draft will not be adopted , as the draft will not be imposed on how Egyptian authorities can &apos;t register to those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ary , parliament@@ arians and sponsors of the legisl@@ ator , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a us@@ ern@@ ame and a password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall to block the Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to educate a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egypt and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network .
yet it is not so far known that such plans are up .
experts and experts on the ground are sc@@ ep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; intro@@ duc@@ tory research ) &quot; of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( EI@@ PR , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt much about the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things dealing with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are managed by force physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them serious , then that means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens that apply for a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court @-@ process .
it is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first discuss with leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure of parliament and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his assumption and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft is being maxim@@ ized in line with one pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no devi@@ ant nar@@ ration around the screen is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year the Parliament @-@ label T@@ amer El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y won a law@@ ful template against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison for those provided was found guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and to test@@ ify to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the Tier@@ sch@@ ütz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq wanted to protect the spiritual Persian Leop@@ ards .
one sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards which acc@@ esses through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of its habitat and since they find less and less lo@@ ot .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard the only remaining beast of prey in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem depends also on that a great pre@@ dat@@ as is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see an Persian Leop@@ ards actually in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero . when the team st@@ ems from the video that they have a shot of a great cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks into pure joy .
as a trained Biolog@@ ist , R@@ aza passi@@ on@@ ately love a different side of their country , which consists of only out of war and conflict .

in the beginning of March 2017 , the dedicated daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to re@@ construct the lives of those who had been affected by the &quot; Trinity &quot; of March 2011 . a vast earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the catastrophe .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai that is in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a great pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan . both of them had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pr@@ z@@ apping of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ated , for the ts@@ un@@ ami had whole seaside towns away from the map .
yet the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had already experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows the progress made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of Japanese re@@ construc@@ tors as well as survey results of those affected by themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( S@@ hi@@ on@@ ana , Beer , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i &apos;s biggest success was able to record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has 75 percent of such houses finished , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima has 70 percent of the final light .
however , one still makes every effort to continue even six years after the catastrophe , Ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ shi@@ fts ( Red , Warsaw , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts .
after the thre@@ e@@ fold disaster almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in containers .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers .
almost 40 percent of those in 2011 Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima lives still in emergency accommodation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful in this case . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated , which rests after the disaster in containers , were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three countries concerned
like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper , 10@@ 74 were affected by 1100 schools , which were affected by the un@@ just until December 2016 , which almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , have only 30 percent of fishing ports in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of fishing ports .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ y accident , have been in the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land in a co@@ ar@@ dent .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , whereby only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of non @-@ agricultural agricultural areas can be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic accident is , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ us@@ zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the tourism rec@@ alled along the tourism , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima stay far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , only 75 percent can be found .
however the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is harder to feel their livel@@ i@@ hoods .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to obtain a total image , the paper conducted numerous frag@@ ments among the native population and under the ev@@ acu@@ ated . they asked them over the state of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the domestic people .
the survey took that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ amis .
however , 55.@@ 9 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed that were still not done enough in the cat@@ astroph@@ es of disasters .
as it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated out of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in her edition to the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also increases its attention to the position of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to take not only the giant earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also witn@@ essed , nuclear , atomic facts , nuclear accidents , the Japan ever had to experience .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated by Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 000 people were displ@@ aced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , somewhat more than 23 000 people , have been moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in long @-@ term spare parts of the country .
at the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the Kat@@ ast@@ ro@@ phen@@ land , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated buildings are still in containers , older than 50 years old . they must compete internationally for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . here it is building projects , which are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , you often recognize that one more links than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important since they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we watch exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention when they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment where they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and countries .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i tells about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Al@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa spoke about the time when love for music has worked in London ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time when she has worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widely spread photo .
an Brazilian student at the age of 33 were delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a p@@ stock against the head . nation@@ wide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied Social Sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ ität Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ stag and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and have now put him into an artificial coma .
its condition is considered critical .
the local educational journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , who rapidly spread rapidly into Brazil within a few days .
in the pictures the face of the police officer is also identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian city of Go@@ i@@ ás , known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been per@@ pen@@ ed until the conclusion of the investigation of the event of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his p@@ unch on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police officer aud@@ ited by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive station , his face would be able to see six months on television and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press can@@ als of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided the video that was attacked by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus was attacked by the police officers and several ou@@ tr@@ ans briefly to him .
another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective is also fil@@ med in social networks .
in the shown clip one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have become 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,500 euros ) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be bra@@ ve , Mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing has been shared multiple times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás in memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist prisoners was killed by his father , because he joined the Occup@@ y movement of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group , and here we have been attacked the very sad event of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira since Silva who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , having attacked him by a polic@@ eman , who has be@@ aten it with a stroke .
police @-@ gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which last Friday took a brutal police force against demonstr@@ ators .
polic@@ emen put at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had er@@ ected a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ r@@ osse and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Zer@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , the police called on speakers to reno@@ un@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers around the country .
once again the Brazilian media street protests per@@ si@@ fts by adding the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window plate .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo , targeted over a bro@@ ker glass windows , to make up with a photo their tit@@ ular illustrations .
on the other hand , the O Glo@@ bo pre@@ preferred a cover @-@ story with a set @-@ down bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken wind@@ screen as over the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend a special cause .
this must also recognise if you are strictly against any form of atomic damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vand@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence did of the military police with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of un@@ in@@ duced villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar be@@ et factories in Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the community community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar@@ s - irrespective of what there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest@@ s on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar be@@ et factories were buried .
after receiving the sugar be@@ et industry was silent in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its installations , until only the sc@@ aff@@ old made up of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves again .
some rarely changes the work .
other re@@ signed and pend@@ ent daily to the factories that are still mah@@ len .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar@@ be@@ et industry does not smoke his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region of sugar be@@ et factories , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were received .
this was something that he was not expecting .
N@@ ene re@@ members exactly heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would be preserved the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar supply industry had already res@@ ist the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effici@@ encies and climate change .
in 2016 the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced amount .
the message would have been a mot@@ if for alarm for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harvest@@ s have already been no new .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar@@ be@@ et industry turned off ?
the old railway walk of the church saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar@@ be@@ et industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar@@ be@@ et factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive , they were intol@@ erable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on the production on the most effective factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
you only left the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives , which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar@@ s on the world market .
nevertheless the sugar prices increased about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of in@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound remain , according to the 2016 published report &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and nutrition organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the pipe @-@ export would bring about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day is certainly in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the factory factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the lact@@ ation of a total of 98 sugar be@@ et factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the Bu@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez was working in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talking about the closing of the factory , the word he repeated the most , &quot; sh@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
so that the place is received , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first lap year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially com@@ prised of documents occupied with regard to the parts that would be removed to address the address and date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , just the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from there the responsibility was over and the letters have come more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for two years for the tac@@ kl@@ ed factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the yet in operation .
Eddy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was opposed to his will on the lact@@ ation of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with every part that he has left , dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important work@@ ben@@ ers was er@@ ased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases there have been no alternatives for the work@@ places and services that generated plants in communities within which they found themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the dam President in the eyes of the present persons saw , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closing of sugar be@@ et factories
since 2004 sugar cane is reduced only high by the deposit .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the community community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar manufacture closed , or better said than they began to pick them off , they also listened to the road to asp@@ halt , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Eddy other factories .
they were made to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new system are still impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ four harvest@@ ing bring the old soldiers a R@@ ent of two thousand p@@ es@@ os per month to spend the years at retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a mess@@ ing person , yet he gives the lies that you told him , not .
she has tor@@ n him for ten years .
N@@ ene is about 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is not on strength , but because he is bitter .

first Nations young people use Hip Hop to express themselves and find their own culture

young people from the First Nations @-@ Communities all over Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them . they do it with Hip Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour have been producing mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres , to teach youth groups , son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were headed by the Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree @-@ communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hip Hop Group The North@@ Star .
the workshop is thus increasing the young participants in conversations like &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self acceptance , or whatever comes the mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos that young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na A@@ ks@@ a Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ chen@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia relates , for example , the history of the highway 16 , also &quot; highway of the tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video games to convey how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs despite influences by globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always domin@@ ate the languages of the first Nations language .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree first nation has taken , the ref@@ rain on the ree is sung .
the young@@ sters involved got a little help from Gary Jol@@ ly from North@@ star Hip Hop Group who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree lie@@ h .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is at your disposal the St@@ rop@@ he in heading , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to go further my days on earth
this is the day when you will take up our cry
because we lost our way in life as youth
but I believe we will rise by one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and take advantage of our youth
this is how you can do what it determines the Creator
in the commentary box , the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ schrift ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plast@@ geri@@ chte had not only shown in the restaurant
plastic grated ( s@@ ap@@ ed ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan one can see almost any restaurant sculp@@ tural dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly on the menu , which is exactly on the menu , will be issued close to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ az@@ u ( hi@@ ke , known , &quot; plastici@@ zing models of the dishes &quot; ) of each dish which is served in this restaurant .
the customers look at these plastic courts and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic surgery .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that produce just those sculp@@ tural dishes made by the German film@@ makers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese people these plastic debr@@ is usually that they are not even stri@@ ving to them . however , a new trend is turning it today in con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous cell @-@ accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photographs that make this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ itation .
now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ made decorative panels , as they are shown at K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ ten collective articles , as in this case , refriger@@ ation magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ft Cool@@ er &apos;s magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at Tokyo station .
the new boom of the Es@@ sen@@ im@@ ents is increasingly increasing .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile rack .
for this tri@@ ang@@ ular dish ( lol ) we have found as a mobile @-@ stand a good use .
also this part we prepared for the exhibition at Tokyo &apos;s train station .
and here is an apple that puts your mobile phone :
designed to watch as an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing bet .
some mobile phones and mobile phone designers permit you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon are used , a popular to@@ pping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with sal@@ mon betra@@ yed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts may also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our new cell phone stands has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition , there are also motor@@ balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried fruits .
further sk@@ ur@@ si@@ cal plastic debr@@ is you can see at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver L@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the has@@ ht@@ ag # 1 , Trans@@ lator , プ@@ ナ@@ チ@@ ュ@@ ラ@@ ン .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi who is devoted to the interests of the restaurant industry . for example , the sho@@ ots of the restaurant .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic debr@@ is actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports , and foreign media via the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug @-@ trading &quot; in Mexico , the missing and dis@@ appears regularly only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which brings this struggle with itself .
the reporting about drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ els , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict totally in the background .
on the day after a violent attack , there is hardly any one looking at the sad@@ der or the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind each row , behind each bone , the stories of loose parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wo@@ unds might never be able to heal .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico developed the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug @-@ trading &quot; ) , &quot; which aims to give such victims and stories of people carrying out the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project such as :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug trafficking and whole communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to change life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who picked up every weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Rod@@ r@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost their father in just one day , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we also prepare for the task we have asked to go and look for gra@@ ves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my Son is Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras M@@ ata .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are at the insurance of my father , but they do not get paid , because they require a ster@@ de@@ ed rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are worried . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ ico .
your contribution reminds us that your violence should never be considered normal , no matter what shape it occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and sensors for a few years now .
I come to Tim@@ iso@@ ara every day and see the tit@@ ular pages with images , which actually only can be from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the Only , the indicated or sad . it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body once belonged .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be if it is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have something like that .
I see our weakness if stories go to mere figures in a stati@@ stic section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness of the people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neighboring town is justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ mitt@@ edly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they attempt to talk about such trag@@ e@@ dies when they are not st@@ ir and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months ext@@ or@@ tion in the main city district : &quot; it describes how armed crime month for month money was destroyed by their business , until they end up not only the shop but also their family had been tor@@ n apart .
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life completely within a few days .
the pain over it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high if you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also have .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed , the better .
she included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when they will cause you or to kill you .
I asked myself in these fri@@ ght@@ ful days whether I would solve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the reply is no , because I forgot how to we@@ pt . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; Die ver@@ forgotten Kinder von Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence emerged . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a mixed woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ik@@ os ?
he is not like other young age of his age whose parents worry about them .
Br@@ yan is a commodity and he told him to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tortil@@ las warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which live with him . this is his name for preparing the flood@@ ing with water , sugar and milk pul@@ ley .
he relates of the nine fo@@ ols on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , one said to him that his mother disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years ago when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody ly@@ ri@@ che of his father saw that shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence is organised by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of charges for public security and the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ ut@@ or of 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands stories that organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in view of ever new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those that we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; has established the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading that has tor@@ tured the country over the past four decades , in a intelli@@ gible manner .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages that he links , contain images on which violence is shown .
the Fak@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment when it comes to up@@ lift , or fal@@ si@@ fy a for@@ gery .
but what is the years after something appeared ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , t@@ ends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR@@ C ) .
since its first release it was mis@@ leading to prof@@ iling , trag@@ e@@ dies who actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dragon News - denied not the fact that there is ample coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a pet@@ rol ch@@ amo@@ unted to the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . there , 230 people came to life .
after the civil war in Africa the biggest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths of stroke that were difficult to ride .
trag@@ ically , the last tank fell to the victim .
administration representatives described a fire@@ ball to envel@@ ope the need@@ y houses including a cin@@ emas in the vicinity , which was full of people that illustr@@ ates the football world .
houses contamin@@ ated and conden@@ sed cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ kenn@@ ess .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; of Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Extra photos of the incident form the gray @-@ full scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows c@@ utter@@ ed body which are bor@@ row@@ ed on the floor as people watch them .
but here the story does not find her end .
over the years , the same photo was re@@ written several times in social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , com@@ bat@@ ants of the B@@ oko Har@@ am the remot@@ ely Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities in front of which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and sur@@ name in streets and bushes .
reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one &apos;s back to count on to count , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were car@@ ded , shot or burned .
only in order of satellite images , the Fol@@ ge@@ time could be im@@ printed .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army staff in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ ths and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo has emerged again , as proof of the fact and the potential scope of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ normal use of the image from the DR Congo is only a number of mis@@ claims ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the image has been presented as a test@@ ament to mass evalu@@ ations .
another step further bring personal comments like this example is mist@@ aken the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also joined in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a Blitz@@ message , published by the United Nations , those who could flee the saw , rape and any mess@@ enger , some of them .
while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s like the following that these descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR Congo :
this painting comes from a sau@@ di @-@ Arab news page which I said , the president of the mar@@ s Th@@ ein being said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo to get this information .
the original fee that was recently attacked on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other messages organizations that AF@@ P used as their source , had also written Th@@ ein He@@ ating this statement , but had not associated with the image of the DR Congo .
the global range of false information
traces of these false compositions are ranging back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converted image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can see how far information borders can exceed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture gallery with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18,@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures found the said image from the DR Congo very similar .
they origin@@ ate from a mis@@ ch@@ mas@@ ch of private sides , platforms of social media and common as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed the wrong reports to for@@ ge others , the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing have to be lar@@ v@@ ous .
we have bor@@ dered examples of the ab@@ used usage and linked them to the respective countries on which page they were posted . thus , we want to make the reach more clearly than by the language alone .
a number of examples may be used from the listed below ( in some cases ) , several examples may be used for mal@@ ign@@ ing use .
here are some cases that can now be fully er@@ ased ( on the card in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
site examples from false cou@@ plings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ colored countries point out on pages or server , about the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ oods are still available .
the countries in Gray are examples which are according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also f@@ ake .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online panel forum ( judged by Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ et , express@@ ing sympathy compared to the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , following claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted to del@@ ve , since the photos of it were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
in Myanmar , the government of Myanmar has published a jud@@ gement on what they came as &quot; int@@ enti@@ onal fin@@ alised news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments came to create mis@@ concep@@ tions regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this indic@@ t@@ ment which is only published in English also includes references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of rum@@ ors who operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to present that Muslim Budd@@ hist@@ s kill and other sr@@ um ( which is often distributed by bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) .

this mail , addressed to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x community , clearly shows that the picture of the DR Congo will NOT demonstrate that Christians kill .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this message has been argu@@ ed that the President of Myanmar has been united in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image of S@@ ange .
the article has been updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 over Stu@@ dents , who were introduced by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by now , the Catholic pri@@ ze@@ able news of An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly explained that the picture does not origin@@ ate from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar to @-@ ha@@ dist@@ ic attack . &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant that there would be connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fer@@ ya@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria separ@@ ating the world ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , and cle@@ ared up a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the An@@ schl@@ ag on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were taking these events , which occurred in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ pt as a test@@ ament to the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with it were raised in no religious context .
instead , the aim was to attract attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was alle@@ ged@@ ly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re , in circulation , it translated into discussion like this here at Vietnam@@ ese and said it to Fal@@ se .
from the message in which the image from the DR Congo has been included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are other confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , The Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , ag@@ greg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) ink also points , but are no longer fully re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ est@@ amp / dates exist on the web cra@@ cra@@ b and record them via image file in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original un@@ bi@@ ce of 2010 , the picture is ultimately possibly a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are here two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) which under@@ go these post@@ s . the first frame is focused on religion .
the picture was used in relation to larger discussions about silence related to the murder of Christians from Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ yas .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss , how a African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how pictures are used in the context of these efforts .
however , a deep@@ est question is what happens when readers could no longer believe this pictures .
with social media , there are zig people that are un@@ intended to cor@@ ro@@ de the water around a tragedy .

the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ draws of images of a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that violent images reader and audience des@@ ens@@ iti@@ ze and give them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which studied , like violent media to help others ) .
while there is quite a lot of serious represent@@ ations to be discussed in the news media , the fact that they are essential for the current news reporting .
Techn@@ ologists experiments experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against &apos; F@@ ake News &apos; . you will have to think thoroughly about situation in which a picture suggests something , which actually is also dis@@ solved from the context or on totally ab@@ used type .
any investigation of false supplements should also take into consideration how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog revealed the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
images of Andy Simm@@ ons used in compliance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( Z. D@@ t. uns@@ irre@@ plac@@ eable ) attempts to offer voice enthusiastic about words from all over the world who are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ matched words are already well known ( as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the span@@ so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or phrase does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant to be with this one word .
these unique words have already been collected for quite a time in an online list .
most of these lists are to deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , whereas the author and Lingu@@ ine is of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog one can find words from pl@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , like :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - pam@@ per@@ ing you with your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , like :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after you war@@ med down on cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
you wear other cultures , reve@@ aling different approaches , and wake up our curiosity .
sometimes you affect how to analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site even want to publish more of these &quot; un@@ matched &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Tre@@ asure &apos; Langu@@ ages &quot; that are much appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to be able to upload their favorite sw@@ elling here .

how Sri Lanka goes down with the worst fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrop@@ hic flood of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is at the moment the worst of flood and nar@@ rated disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , who usually act at the end of May , are characterized by strong rains , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , gin , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 district in the south and west of the country over the banks .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the flo@@ ods and mud .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safety locations .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygien@@ ic proportions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the disaster :
flo@@ ods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water temperature of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like Azz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lan@@ kan fatal flo@@ ods are wor@@ sen the den@@ otes crisis , the Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus in the flood , water stood up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ag@@ oda at G@@ alle also flood@@ ed because of the yesterday covered water@@ p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ oda E@@ la .
the Air Force has five planes available for lif@@ egu@@ ards and another five is completed for transport of emergency deliveries to the residents &apos; flood@@ ed villages .
also different organizations and start @-@ ups have explained to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ toire in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water supply and humanitarian aid .
if any search and bail@@ out threats will require for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood @-@ offering -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 49@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 to help animals in this area need help .
the tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their s@@ iting data with the help of the app to receive the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ole center .
last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ se Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; flood protection &quot; button which allows users to charge up a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ical R@@ ote cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful boat trips for flo@@ ods and earnings closed to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need for security and provide assistance with assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan is now a long way up to the recovery of norm@@ ality .

use Li@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love his girlfriend .
I trust her four year old daughter , she convers@@ ant with me her children ; she is my rock in the field .
in one minute , we still call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next post we are rights for Trans@@ gen@@ cies .
we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a head tow@@ el , bound by an American flag , other sc@@ are slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam host@@ ility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks to me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; question I . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already have this conversation already led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or to know people whom I have known for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has built up in its conception . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you escape me .
there are more than 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify to be a Muslim , to different species but somehow we all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is in our collective imagination such as well constructed that as soon as Muslims are not cleaning there .
cav@@ iti@@ zes are lim@@ it@@ ized
I ste@@ h not alone .
that is even to the poet , whose poetry in America is best sold : Rum@@ i .
which images come in a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ars .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in Western performance the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another exists in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ American paintings of Muslims , Western books have been coloni@@ zed for centuries .
this temp@@ ting picture is determined by the dark man that man should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian people Edward S@@ aid put the story behind these paintings in the 19@@ 70s .
but these pictures are also visible today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to per@@ ish them .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative is dominant .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led to their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential race .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to acknowledge their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and to cover sau@@ di Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens mus@@ lim@@ ous women who lead movements for change .
it looks forward that the first Muslim Pra@@ yers have been talked to the American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers who were hi@@ red as far as slave @-@ ships .
he del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this scar@@ ring has occupied our collective imagination such deep and faul@@ ty that often Sik@@ h men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ climate attacks and bullying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and about the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to include 1,7 billion euros
in the news industry we do more than only stories to tell , which are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create f@@ og@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we are here failed to make seven million Muslims the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to immigrants from the first generation to come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother placed her first jewelry in the 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscr@@ apers of New York . skyscr@@ apers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan turned out the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ surrounded Muslims and Americans .
but am I now an irre@@ ver@@ sive Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when I ask people why I don &apos;t say por@@ k attack , I say - rather than to pick up my Muslim recipes or hold my hand@@ some T@@ bil@@ let to carry out all Muslims - &quot; from respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ okes , we do not carry all the handker@@ chief with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological expert in order to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to become almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding mus@@ lim@@ ous schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are trying to fight well lies lies over Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing band of a well @-@ proven anti @-@ quality anti @-@ instin@@ cts , Th@@ ink Tank or experts for Fal@@ se information which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them there is Islam@@ ism in more than just one stran@@ ger who r@@ attle the tow@@ el in a woman .

Islam host@@ ility in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so wide , versatile and multi @-@ fac@@ eted that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

I want to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but was born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social @-@ ists describe religious life , they attack on the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim belief and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my f@@ els in the Bran@@ dung , that I am Muslims , if they could look through the 15 metres concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the sole ritual with my daughter if I split them into my arms and her the Arab verses to protect the cor@@ po@@ ds that are called the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each one of them repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from the evil one , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother with her sisters , as she began to win a competition of the art of the flor@@ ist in Kar@@ achi .
it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : N@@ ano , surrounded by their full and un@@ finished painting , Su@@ fi saint , and a cor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred @-@ and@@ ten chapters , which can be almost impossible .
Muslim to be to speak the prayers that they told me , when I have a bad day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims work in it as she brought me to God : Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a people that has been coloni@@ zed over centuries - by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; coloni@@ zed , which has established a company with the name hon@@ orary British Ost@@ ro@@ des Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning , God , to name my only Lord .

inter@@ c@@ ess@@ ly , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence K@@ asch@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Ja@@ an Un@@ rounded around his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in his arms in half a century .
belonging to know is that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians who have dealt with their families , like with my grandfather , of coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the match .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim to be knowing that during the last two centuries Europeans all have to coloni@@ alise all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first a@@ erial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected in a century about a Muslim land .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir of the British empire , referred to the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he introduced the first mosque in England .
even before there were air@@ planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim trunk of 1,7 billion it goes deeply into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ ess ; our un@@ folded history .
it means that four@@ teen years ago the migh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops being distributed over every continent aside from the Antarc@@ tic , were distributed to im@@ pover@@ ished in Iraq in order to pursue mass destruction .
it means to know more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim does not mean that the murder rate among veter@@ ans have risen since 2001 by more than 32 percent .
it means to know that when a tragedy is home to the US and the susp@@ ects has a Muslim name , the history of four times will be reported as a story of a white attack .
it means to know that four @-@ hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , of a liber@@ ated black slaves was called on the name of Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was vers@@ kl@@ av@@ ed and brought to this land two hundred years ago .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .

an Americ@@ anism , a Pak@@ ist@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , meaning an inherent inter@@ se@@ ab@@ norm@@ ality of our with multiple forms of ident@@ ities , but to fail them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,7 billion has more possibilities than a mag@@ ici@@ an , but is represented in the reduced branch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother to make my child care and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that su@@ preme and privileged people on this branch is structural and xen@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ ism lies in the Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and have been extended under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration , which takes a five year old child in hand @-@ waves .
it is in a country that ex@@ cludes its borders towards people from the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a wrong and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims in visa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs which we are throwing in Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and about who we are not telling , we are here today .

the con@@ vic@@ tions we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep , a Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades to realize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous im@@ prints we squee@@ ze in our news actions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which attempts to capture our many @-@ line ident@@ ities and forgotten history .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global time , where we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason for conspir@@ acy the@@ or@@ ist , who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now run the White House .
they grew exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims too &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by adding the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago they had not given them yet ; now they domin@@ ate great areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about realities and the history of which I was not aware of as I was as old now , as it is my daughter now , but which today made me a UFO Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ basket in my speech .
things that may ar@@ ouse memories , for in all the inter@@ se@@ tions that power our humanity likes to lau@@ gh a story where someone is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , will take place in the context of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred academies talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools to read or which we read in our newspapers .

we all must ask ourselves why ?
why would I tell you here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people caused by the formation of &quot; other &quot; in public performance , four decades ago , the Stan@@ ford .
we need to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of this , conscious and un@@ conscious the &quot; other &quot; that we imagine a new future in which we have no president , the chocolate bun@@ ker spe@@ ople while he has already broken countries and &apos; to other &quot; people bombar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it begins with all of us .
initiative for Stru@@ ting aims to preserve ur@@ bane lingu@@ istic diversity
story to tell , Flick@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an opportunity here and now despite a language barrier with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Tre@@ asure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the number of stories in their original language possible .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ al@@ able blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written words , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and worthy of language variety of cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages do not pass to the children there .
for the makers of the project applies :
the mass@@ aging of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities to assume the diversity - secure spaces , in which people do not have to forget who they are to da@@ ve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often is often linked to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purpose these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to estimate and make sense to estimate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers represent her story first in her own language and translate or then explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , giving their dedication and representation that the audi@@ ences can depend on it .
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ ellers of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou are also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of the related art .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ abel of the rab@@ bit and the pl@@ um in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
having asked the meaning of his foot , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to a public speaking your language ? &quot; with a wide ridge he divi@@ des his feeling of exclusi@@ vity :
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Tre@@ asure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling were taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for new sovereig@@ n debt from the USA
with the aim of a re@@ viewing of public debt of Puerto Rico , who fought for 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration , the march started at the Spi@@ ik@@ an Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the historic centre of San Ju@@ ans .
it was called by group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( Citi@@ zen for the neur@@ examination of debts ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ean Church of Puerto Rico .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the new promotion of debt also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , banks and government agencies responsible for debt to be held responsible for their corrupt .
we call for a financial review and a mission board with no personal interests to public debt , with a permanent , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy .
we will pres@@ cribe and supp@@ resses .
the people of Puerto R@@ ican refused to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be ab@@ duc@@ ted with a decline .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the sovereig@@ n territory of the USA - is suffering from a difficult financial crisis .
therefore the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; is propos@@ ing the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a ruling @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation , with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis in Puerto Rico requires a broad re@@ organization of state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside , measures will be imposed without participation and conviction of the citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; danger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nach@@ tw@@ ache for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian we@@ ster@@ er Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but it is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing to campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s time : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture held in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , manager of the Book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ enquiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was released last year and is lic@@ enced here , contains a series of p@@ sets that deal with free culture in the face of repression .
it is a tri@@ bute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are to be built and what the real costs are , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researcher , and authors who have worked alongside the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to look over the fo@@ g that surround our news@@ letters and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to rid Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celeb@@ rating internet volunteers that has been in@@ det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled out of the list of Ad@@ ra pris@@ ons in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about the current state or location .
the intro@@ duc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us start thinking about their own destiny , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
why did we decide ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time @-@ wise extrem@@ es ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the prison sy@@ r@@ ischer government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military institution to a non @-@ known place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had based on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; armed command of his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported it to be contacted on 12 November 2015 by individuals who asked himself as the insi@@ der of the Assad administration and put them aware of a so @-@ called death @-@ part against her husband .
its location and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and wiki@@ pedia , Bass@@ el played a vital role in making access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technical ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , founded the Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Basel &apos;s cultural prototyp@@ es fores@@ ees the work that he began with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the hall@@ way of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not know that at that time he could not know that ten years after working with this work , the IS would place everything because it stands not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip in the digital ar@@ che@@ ology and the preservation has created a time @-@ capsule that will in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
typically , Bass@@ el has not yet been able to complete this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name n@@ enne .
Bass@@ el brought me English even when he was already in cust@@ ody .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he always has shared his knowledge with everyone who has been asked . he has taught other incar@@ nations , English to write and speak .
Bass@@ el has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me , both computer and smartphones .
he brought me to the internet .
he also brought to other ar@@ rests , as they use computers , at least theoretically , without them being one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a reference visit , which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 her husband , when he was in cust@@ ody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura worked together on the book one year .
they sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them from the Arabic to English .
the book is licensed .
book by Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is devoted to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it is happening with every visit ,
that I reconc@@ ile eyes in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment , in which we embrace the poor ,
that each of the dangers does not matter ,
everybody der Z@@ ä@@ une , F@@ es@@ seln and W@@ ächter
I forget the heart@@ ed of prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words .
which I carry with passion for me
if your eyes would be happy
and I leave with you another piece of my soul ...
I return soon to my lon@@ eliness ,
to return all the moments
and to smile over your absence .
I convey to myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the det@@ ention of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year for@@ ging , my soul
during the day
I in your c@@ age I am ,
and you are still In the c@@ age of monsters
the story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad are gone out according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Sy@@ ris@@ ky Network for Human Rights ) more than 65,@@ 000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared or executed by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , since 2011 the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in cust@@ ody .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption Ver@@ ur@@ teil@@ ter Director after release from release again to previous post
Moz@@ ambi@@ ans dism@@ issed with anger on a cor@@ rup@@ tive case , in which a ruling member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus at the state of state apparatus .
it is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested in 2008 and 2010 together with four other def@@ endants of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euros ) was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
the money origin@@ ate from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que airports , whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza manage between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately demanded his re@@ inst@@ ation into the company , which happened on 19 April then .
in accordance with an opinion of the general prosec@@ ution of the Republic , the request quot@@ ed , there would be no obstacles in Cam@@ b@@ aza again to rec@@ ti@@ fy its old posts because the company did not run any discipl@@ in@@ ary proceedings after its cust@@ ody .
however , many inhabitants do not agree well .
the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de p@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , in brief CI@@ P ) , a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clar@@ i@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the CI@@ P .
what we take note is that the company should have undertaken a discipl@@ in@@ ary proceedings against the res@@ ist @-@ treated .
however , the firm seem to be however and promp@@ ted no proper legal action to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ can social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well as regards the case as &quot; resi@@ sting . &quot;
when Cam@@ b@@ aza a competent type would be , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and then half of them eat .
he might pay paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and his image .
but since it is in@@ competent , he has con@@ stri@@ pped to become integrated into the company that he helped harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly be paid for his silence .
vile !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ kaner and Student of Political Science in Brazil says the director of NO mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza created from the state because he comp@@ lied him , I cannot believe that someone is rewarded with someone in such a way that the state has already insul@@ ted so massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks the mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only serves themselves by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as hand@@ over to become an in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ble money , and the state itself has become tired , which has been up@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mos@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves is in the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as a first independent president , but also as a sharp , one @-@ board and - even in the case - proph@@ etic red@@ der .
one of his most famous verbal represent@@ ations was , when he confirmed , &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , the f@@ ather@@ land for its ambitions , his own individual interest , sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience indicates that it is not that way . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn from his ambitions .
an ambitious man is at the same time crimin@@ ally . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also abl@@ eh@@ n@@ able :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and came free .
and today he sets the company , in which he re@@ inde@@ b@@ ate funds again , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ pl@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - scru@@ pul@@ ley , ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017
Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( dt . : @ Truth ) indicates that crime is paid in Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
in fact , to be in # Moz@@ ambi@@ que th@@ ief and Di@@ ener of # Fre@@ lim@@ o , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , sentenced to long possible imprisonment , returns to the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que - Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo ( @ deck@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) 11th May 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored a lot of users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means Ch@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ ig@@ b@@ se .

according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their post from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although on the origin of the word still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origins , or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ mes@@ an script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years the rise has been radic@@ alised nation@@ alist movements of the word an extremely remote con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that most often used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;s usually has to be associated with racism but the word itself is not calling for an automatically hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also post@@ s in which they have discussed the use of the word or have question@@ ed a doubt of his usage , cen@@ sored .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ical words with fundamental mean@@ ings which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for instance , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ ig@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; cal@@ ark@@ aar &apos;s &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ n@@ utzer A@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however he wonder@@ ed his friends on a spiritual way , whether they w@@ ont know how he could re@@ lie@@ ve his back pain by doing a word play .
the phrase ku la - &quot; He@@ ating &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) to Bur@@ mes@@ an - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ills is the opinion that they will be more radical nation@@ alist nation@@ alists , but it also stressed that Facebook must be analytical ben@@ ds before it ex@@ pose all the post@@ ures that can spread in the suspic@@ ion against racism .
Facebook cle@@ ars the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automatic mechanism will not understand what you are looking at Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should instead do is to analyze the mail carefully and control it by checking the following words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot;
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists have spread the Hass@@ an , a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat , proved that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of stroke is often a cat@@ chy and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply begin to use a new word or an alternative notation of the cen@@ sored words to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to clear his post@@ s , when he wanted to share his friends just that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a mail to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and it was forbidden to post office , items and parts of content for 24 hours because of the post &quot; Facebook community standards was not un@@ answered . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of different kinds of people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ an radic@@ alised nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed , who has nothing to do with Hass@@ an :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author informed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more done before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
such words must be cen@@ sored only more hat@@ red within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they started without the local context or technical support and have been forbidden as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ ed@@ curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they attempted to correct the random@@ ly deleted post@@ s .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a big turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of don@@ keys under the users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now talking about Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ ar &apos; to see if their post@@ s are taken from the net .
here you can see some scre@@ enshots from Facebook post@@ ings which have no written language , but nevertheless were removed :
use with permission .
the Bur@@ mes@@ an text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and a pe@@ ti@@ curr@@ y eat and an Indian film .
only to check out if Facebook contains the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screens@@ hot , with permission used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screens@@ hot , with permission used .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used the social networks to extend their votes and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks will include violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ins where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook was for his failure to crit@@ ici@@ ze the ext@@ ant Hass@@ an on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides under control .
but instead of simply speaking the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it could have been better running , rather on context as on code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the children &apos;s toe
a wedding ring in the sand .

the nur@@ sery has now been illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament voted un@@ anim@@ ously decided which to ban this practice , so that it is now up to 18 .
prior to this change in marriage , some members were arrested some members of Hin@@ doo and Muslim religious communities in May 2016 . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state cannot inter@@ f@@ ere , since that , however , age does not im@@ pose the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened in whatever the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting @-@ partner to the UN &apos;s justi@@ fication , the min@@ ors as , every man under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 there were 8.@@ 1 percent .
2011 confirmed the statistical central office of the country that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , who were eager to manage laws on child &apos;s toe , followed at the foot and delighted with great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring this result .
nonetheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u guide , such as had no concerns about telling the critics of the child &apos;s toe , they ought to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition cat@@ ered for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime soon question@@ ed whether the opposition would agree with the bill of law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill introduced against the mon@@ og@@ amy - despite four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which included , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country has to appro@@ ve , and the law is announced .
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ramb@@ har@@ at : the bill introduced against the children &apos;s e @-@ marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it .
having decided previously in the Senate , the draft can now become the law .
the majority of social media users was thrilled , because the laws of child@@ birth have been finally changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who holds a minist@@ erial post in the Department of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary bar@@ ge needed to wear the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the nur@@ sery has now been illegal in Trinidad and Tobago , and that is almost every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson of mind was , it definitely was long enough to manage the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which implies : , , Her@@ vor@@ ous News !
the spouse @-@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota that belong to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group , which was fairly open about it , as important the adoption of the law noted :
the heating system in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious conf@@ essions 18 years .
the draft to change the spouse has been adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the vote .
all Members who were as@@ serted were voted for the law .
the nur@@ sery is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ isch@@ ild@@ ad .
many thanks to all activists who have challenged him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
but a possible hook occurs in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aja therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well known Hind@@ u organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aja has proclaimed his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to ple@@ ad his promises .
during the general prosec@@ ut@@ or Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of law , meant to be quite legally , if Mahar@@ aj on the law would go forward , most social media users would like to deal with the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck before :
dear Sat , when we , instead of discussing the discussion so bro@@ adly , in a way that we would talk to the state that the state , our daughters previously protects that they may be mis@@ used by major , stub@@ born men who are suffering from major , hard @-@ known men who are ab@@ used to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children &apos;s toe is legal or continue to be the norm even though there are laws that they say .

by the spi@@ red of web pages , Turkish user can look at Wikipedia @-@ content
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia @-@ page was indic@@ ted on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright laws in the United States .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey un@@ locks the popular and on the crow@@ ds@@ ourcing principle based enc@@ ycl@@ opedia Wikipedia .
day by day will be more evident how important the platform for users is to get helpful and reliable information .
both students as well as re@@ porter and fans of TV @-@ series w@@ anders against the barrier .
although many techniques @-@ tested internet users are used to use con@@ di@@ versions for block tools ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest V@@ PN pre@@ valence of the world ) , the most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been dra@@ ined from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society on Har@@ vard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet has been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
after China Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ ism ( pages that are reflected in the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform made all Turkish Wikipedia @-@ pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. machine connections ) , which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship hard .
the content is available despite legal pro@@ hibition .
in a blo@@ mail IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we heard the news ( through the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to put snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia Content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wiki@@ pedi@@ a.org themselves .
IP@@ FS was also involved that this step has been carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about scre@@ enshots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia participated in other efforts to deal with the sperm .

Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to work with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as fri@@ ghtening as they look .
and he should know it because he stand Tig@@ ers already from face to face :
a tiger can be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately turns away , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cked for the protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese and wild animals is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited 22 days long , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take place at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist resorts .

this entry was written by Kay@@ ona@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was again published as part of a content Shar@@ ing Convention .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care to address the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Prad@@ esh provide women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should abuse the norm in their life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned to the Indian state O@@ od@@ a by a head@@ court and rejected by their family and the village community after they had raised a blo@@ ated relative name .
the tradition of their wives also not call the name but is also widespread among men . however , they have far less ad@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not meet these practices .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and became quickly the main @-@ on theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs , which is available in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the destruction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the exposure of practices , such as children &apos;s arms to the compos@@ ing of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and manages these clubs .
it reports on how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of change simultaneously .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini presented in her panel discussion , was by women who did not call their hus@@ bands to name .
she chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation over the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of their hus@@ bands did not speak according to the name of their hus@@ bands &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bri@@ also that they have kept all duties and never question@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition test@@ ified that a woman wants her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t keep this one is seen as a list@@ ener , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted , that we never had thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband so far , to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law and my husband l@@ ull long after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I shall call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in his luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Prad@@ esh .
after the vide@@ o@@ projection the women sought to put the discussion with a practice in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then they asked all , &quot; If we can not say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call ourselves how they want , means that they do not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which she said the name of her sp@@ ouses about the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women could never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy , that she was only outside of the whole exercise ; another decided to settle the whole t@@ apping into fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ alin rush , with an ancient brass also broken , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home their sp@@ ouses of name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini was given a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in his head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the entire family .
when her father @-@ in @-@ law she stra@@ ined her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I must do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation put in violence .
Roh@@ ini tells how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which indicates the hus@@ band@@ ing point :
why do only women show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the van@@ ization point if he did it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I heard that to carry him .
the other women have not yet listened to , but they say they are in a better position , even to choose him not to bear in some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what to hear &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months , they celebrated her own birth@@ days in her life for the first time in her life ; they d@@ anced and spoke about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things , for example , like our ident@@ ities on our sp@@ ouses , never to be honest .
it feels great to say certain things according to it , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have carried only ancho@@ vies in the group since their marriage .
for most of them this is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ary course , a wide shirt above a p@@ ants , wear ; they did not d@@ die .
after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of their own wardrobe , the mor@@ ality associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , slo@@ ping fe@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Upper hem@@ den ) into a panel discussion , so that the women could bear them .
next they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they are going to make it happen .
to the question , whether in the five months since her first discussion club was already changed , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things will slowly come into roles :
we have so far only little steps so far .
some women just try it a few times but then listened to again to say the name of their spouse .
some , including myself , make it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are at the same time .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club knew that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hood to move more freedom of movement or their own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes back home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

a new system of the kid@@ n@@ apping of g@@ ossi@@ p people for the organ@@ ics , pres@@ um@@ ably for aber@@ ration purposes , troub@@ led the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government has now called a number of operations in life to pract@@ ise the pract@@ ition@@ ers .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ bar district , a few kilometres from the border to Mal@@ awi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently raised them that the organs of sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi are used .
there may be the local super@@ st@@ itions that the head of a scratch @-@ cat &apos;s gold could bring gold with old or ri@@ ches , explained the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on gl@@ it@@ tering men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que were registered .
another group , the purpose of ass@@ ass@@ ination for ob@@ sc@@ ure is , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN en@@ rolled out a mission in the South African country to investigate these pract@@ ition@@ ers .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city Map@@ uto .
he warned those who are planning to travel to the country :
be@@ ware of k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are target of ritu@@ alistic attacks in Moz@@ ambi@@ que , warned the mos@@ aic police according to the latest ass@@ ass@@ inations of three gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ ping men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the Mil@@ bar district , where the ass@@ ass@@ inations took place .
Hus@@ band Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and resident of the city of In@@ h@@ amb@@ ane in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police could already be seen :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ aman in the death of the gl@@ it@@ arian men are involved .
the persecution and ass@@ ass@@ ination of gl@@ az@@ ed individuals for the extraction and selling of their organs in the district Mor@@ um@@ bal@@ a , for probably super@@ st@@ itious ritual , has also given the police of the Republic of Mos@@ ambi@@ que into account ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims would have power , the ri@@ ches .
during the last days three men were mur@@ dered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blog@@ ger arms Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who clar@@ ified that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty , which Mos@@ ambi@@ que is facing :
I would like to don@@ ate E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ que , DAS SI@@ CH is ash@@ amed to demand sex against good notes , work and other services , a nation where people would suffer honest employment , work and other achievements to make their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; will be dar@@ ed to move to schn@@ ellem wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity of f@@ ist hum@@ our did not go .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published within the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the ar@@ sen@@ ed Chinese border Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his attorney at the end of June had been announced that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) after calling on the design of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that the democratic reforms in China was suffering .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China has said Li@@ us Fall as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a narr@@ ator , he said it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to talk about this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to give calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , rede@@ em or allow him to have a treatment abroad .
while some countries have crit@@ ici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully exploited .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised several reactions from abroad .
united nations
po@@ inter Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High @-@ Comm@@ iss@@ ar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met Chinese officials in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
but a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway for Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s liberation .
the relationship between China and Norway were sho@@ cking in Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 has been awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government rus@@ hed out that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations have been continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the sal@@ mon after China , since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
after the message had been spread that Li@@ u was serious , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ unconditional release for the expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u , to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his det@@ ention , he was unable to counter his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on July 6th , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was promp@@ ted to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house of house@@ keeping and permit him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she said in a statement on June 30 .
at the same time , we expect to raise all restrictions of Mr Li@@ us Wi@@ fe as well as family members .
they are meant to meet all the visits and they can receive and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
Austria , USA
us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with the fact that the Americans wish him for treatment abroad , in so far it may help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speech in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message of AF@@ P on June 27th that the message calling the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u but also liber@@ ated his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house ar@@ rest .
the call of the U.S. message attracted an angry response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to con@@ sensu@@ al and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom such as motor@@ hom@@ age and access to the medical care of its choice , on which they are entitled to chin@@ ese constitution and judicial system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push forward Li@@ u and his wife unconditional release .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can have known himself in a proper medical treatment . ht@@ tp : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government , Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin I hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he requires &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concern whether the vort@@ ex about Li@@ u could be over@@ thrown the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um to give China an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to worry about his family .
Li@@ us An@@ lawyer told AF@@ P previously , that Li@@ us Woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police are always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , talking and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells about :
Canada is calling for China to safeguard his international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release them to the exercise of these rights of intervention .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Office also called for China in a statement on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments that he , regardless of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact with him .
although the news of France has already reported that the French government would welcome a Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information if France will finally record him .
Taiwan on a Taiwan
the Council of the celebrations in Taiwan urged China on June 27th to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ w@@ anese leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party , called for China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to let themselves be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama showed himself very worried in a statement on June 28 at Li@@ u , and gave us that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us wellness .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was strict pun@@ ished to have led to a harmon@@ ic , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged to have hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem du@@ ly , since Singapore is an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the judicial Minister K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am was to be considered a city in Singapore .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the Prosec@@ ution , the State of New York marked the minister that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be considered to be a city .
... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy be ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the judicial minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twi@@ sted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercising of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and up@@ grades , this valuable land is to create , we hear that we finally have no land .
it sound@@ ed so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory hur@@ t@@ ment .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons given by Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended the idea , according to what the political system of Singapore cannot be measured with other &apos; normal countries &apos; in view of its , it was inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he advoc@@ ates the idea that Singapore was compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerg@@ es from the author@@ it@@ arian feasi@@ bility to be democr@@ ats , leave the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end of the final day , the answers to his American guests were given answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ responses .
appropriate questions tar@@ ts he with non @-@ responses of rational ways .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am to make his mind clear since they did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city is , in which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clear this point where he was paid very much to be part of the city of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by giving An@@ on on the blog his comment , he points to the reviews that you should begin to read the entire ro@@ duction of the conference , so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore a city is and no country .
read the signing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was more like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore be so un@@ equal , even if we are looking free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ad@@ jour@@ ned in Singapore with cities in the U.S. ( and how many of these cities saw a party at a time ago ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously not meant to be in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an illustr@@ ates his disappointment at Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , who is as the leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the judicial minister of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ...
at least I knew about Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de who expects me - whether I agree with them or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts , and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he truly believes and his aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review zer@@ ts the vulner@@ ability of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ um@@ enten :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cou@@ gh@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has committed a mistake , or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ite understanding ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereig@@ n state ?
if not , on which country go back the sovereig@@ n rights of the city Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
as he plays an important role within the ruling class , the statements of Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are more serious .
why does the Lon@@ ers make their military service , defend it only their city but not their country ?
whom must our Prime Minister B@@ ills have to rep@@ ay ?
what is the value of our pink pi@@ ent ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
because the magazine Jour@@ ney of a decade to affir@@ mation , Singapore is and always was a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have been anno@@ yed to many decades ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defence of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Kan@@ adi@@ er &quot;
the can@@ adi@@ an N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screens@@ hot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked short of the editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect to your home country or home country ?
your answers will be posted here as part of a continuing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for the Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I put in Japan most is that is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I am living here and back in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as being polite , interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or to show personal questions .
on my clar@@ ification then follow the default answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps imm@@ in@@ war@@ dly against W@@ ut when they are held for Americans but bot@@ hers me not .
for someone who does not know , there is little that sets us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans can bring a can@@ adi@@ c flag well to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
so it was even when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Tr@@ ump before getting to Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le blades at their luggage to differenti@@ ate themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
with us there are no weapons !
gender @-@ sex mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada also is supposed to be considered the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Kan@@ adi@@ er are nice .
I h@@ asse that .
first , I have many American friends , which I appreciated very much .
it would make me nothing if one would conf@@ use me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
first of all : as &quot; nice &quot; to be referred to , is basically to be lo@@ os@@ ely - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; does not have any personality .
there are no corner and edges , nothing , where you can come across .
harmless to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not deserve attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remot@@ ely from the things around a around .
I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main hom@@ age of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders as &quot; kind &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Just@@ in Tru@@ deau the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy .
musical video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that dict@@ ates the Jun@@ ta to restore the power , and despite their promises to restore the civil government , continue to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Col@@ our describes a young man who tells them his girlfriend makes him his girlfriend .
although not expressly political , the music video refers to the lasting military leadership of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users about their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video on song was an amazing success .
on the first three days alone , this was shared on Facebook with invited Video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator was blocked in Thailand since a group of activists locked up the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
look at once this recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has followed in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may possibly relate to the dra@@ stic section of the pro@@ visional paragraph 44 of the pro@@ visional constitution , which makes an absolute decision @-@ making on important national topics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; introduction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules can often be used by the authorities in order to de@@ vote activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , super@@ vised by the online content and individuals who pre@@ thrown , the monarchy is persec@@ uted to have prosec@@ uted prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets a stri@@ pping against &quot; Read Maj@@ este &quot; ( majest@@ y ) .
on 20 May 2014 in Thailand the war was right .
two days later it came to a coup of the Army .
one of the problems continued to continue the Jun@@ ta is their decision of expensive sub@@ marine boats , although security gu@@ ts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video there will be even shown how people can be thrown into a black product car before taking it into an Inter@@ ni@@ cal camp , a further problem case .
some journalists are in prison , because they have supp@@ os@@ edly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and is threatened with internet users , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the song &apos;s members of the band who im@@ pris@@ oned the Sal@@ ut &apos; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , who was already used by put@@ sch oppos@@ es during protests in 2014 .
life goes on to the ruins of the spirit of the Middle East Asia .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society is very slow in East Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has gone over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war officially ended , but his fo@@ ols are still very visible in this part of the Republic .
the deser@@ ted villages of the Northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , sh@@ lands , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ier living and worked in the area worked in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , most of the Russians and deport@@ es live in the area .
these settlements are also called in Ab@@ b@@ Asia as well as violin towns .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10.000 people lived here today , there are only a few hundred people in these s@@ cour@@ ty@@ res .
this phenomenon is characteristic of the ku@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the population of 16,@@ 000 people since 2011 was hardly increased over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story flat blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called Chr@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ uk@@ ow@@ ka , are symbolic of the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling apart and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it turns him hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why ?
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were municipalities , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that serve all of the community .
now there is only a paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who were once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ek@@ kas , which can host one or two families , one reali@@ zes the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they retreat immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother is forbidden to give us photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers their girlfriend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as li@@ vest@@ ock , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable @-@ cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district management supplies in winter for free candles and bread on the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build the cour@@ get@@ te &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name of Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ ites , as called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter who lived in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ b@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial assistance from her daughter and per@@ si@@ sts that she has instead supported her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she gives .
T@@ unt G@@ ains tells us that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha &quot; , calling T@@ ante G@@ alya you to . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ get@@ te .
I already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build the cour@@ get@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as inter@@ acting Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remembered the vill@@ agers before the war .
despite the relatives who live in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke out just away ) , they did not have the chance to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative settlement in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to build a house there , but this will still take something , &quot; explains it all . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives a $ 9 children for each child .
your man works in the cab@@ bage .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten once found , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
they told that initially a very sc@@ ary situation was , when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her ch@@ angel@@ ness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has to do something with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ends up to the end , a small boy bur@@ ns us by us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy j@@ agt him in .
he plays with the ball , who runs the hill .
a group of children is now pursuing the ball .
while they run , some of them are stones at the falling buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which ensure uncertainty in their lives .
you do not know it different .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez heads a small hotel in tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 at the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of the migrants that Europe or Latin America will cross , certain places for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year &apos;s Mex@@ ik@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a coral glasses and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy@@ ed form .
it is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ an who are on their journey .
the hotel has no charm .
for around 2,50 Dollar the night sleep in simple rooms , with st@@ ole , cr@@ um@@ ble walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign@@ post for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants come here .
sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people in full mini@@ buses and the upper part of the coast start to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you mom for Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it &apos;s rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cardboard boxes .
it does not want anyone to refuse .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they bought them medicines that they can not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that inher@@ ited from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart receives ) pos@@ al with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; reply with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to return home to her husband and three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then moving towards north .
the family had heard about other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a famous name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ an and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling the way together and that the Afri@@ cans speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his imm@@ ac@@ ic companion has lived in Brazil , and worked as buil@@ ders on construction of the Olympic Games and the soccer world .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he has begun his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months : he s@@ ells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bu@@ stu@@ et after Ti@@ juana .
I wonder whether he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that their guests can often send text messages in order to greet them or tell you about the course of their journey .
she explained that her Christian belief is the drive of her work .
she does not know much about Africa but their guests have brought her to prepare her chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a blind alley to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
these winter have taken the death of Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants in their little house .
it is a polic@@ eman and it has established that the Bu@@ stu@@ ets at numerous African migrants are to be sold too expensive .
he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar night .
at the moment are 25 people there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ an .
some sleeping on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least have electricity , a washing machine and a hob out outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that is why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was directed to a raid on his work station from the United States .
the majority of migrants travelled through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez told me that he had escap@@ ed in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , an all @-@ encomp@@ ass@@ ing , has offered him its roof .
some months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the passengers call their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic , because of those who went away .
as a proud grand@@ mother she is fed in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair st@@ ain who made her a Kund@@ in , some photos of her grand@@ children and lots of travellers more , boy and the old .
she was sad , while she pre@@ cip@@ her it shortly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeatedly repeated it every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have been gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install an surveillance app to their mobil@@ es .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ user , S@@ eph@@ tin ( translated )
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities in the West of China are comp@@ elled to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in Tian@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi have received a mobile aler@@ ts in which it shows the District government , a surveillance app called Jing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message is said that the app will hin@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but k@@ ò@@ es the authorities could also use the App for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had so short after they had installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group .
in the communication of the police that the app would determine the sources and the mani@@ fold ways of terrorists and follow , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , books and documents .
Jing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as below :
Jing@@ w@@ ang is a protective services with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block of porno@@ graphic websites , from on @-@ line fraud , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they can spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their own home network .
this app with fil@@ tering for min@@ ors will help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; or even h@@ acker can enable the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while announ@@ cements on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , pressing ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ ing internet im@@ cir@@ cuits .
the on Twitter @-@ based Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( S@@ ing ) ; the cen@@ sored messages published in China , showed photos of a Check@@ point , to the polic@@ emen , checked the inhabitants in@@ discrimin@@ ately as if they had installed the surveillance app .

sleep or death , part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
picture of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane counts his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and realize that you are completely alone in one place where all matters van@@ ished .
everything has gradually released and revealed a truth which is clearly visible from both inside and outside .
one that makes her name all honor .
one that has turned down into a list of feelings and expres@@ sions , that not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you catch the reality again and look behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ress , the beautiful scen@@ eries and performers - the characters into beings of flesh and blood , and all sh@@ outing after death .
all doubt arise in R@@ auch , and you will become aware of your existence , even if Earth moves on the axis of the un@@ question@@ ing . you realize that you are caught up here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents built stone around stone .
they took me and my father three times , but I don &apos;t know that I &apos;m not &quot; my lesson &quot; like the chief of the security services it would be form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he put his power over us under evidence by even destro@@ ying the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we have known .
five young@@ sters were tor@@ n away during a peaceful protest like a we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it went out to bring the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cr@@ ammed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of the districts were co@@ v@@ eted , just my own .
for the first time it was quiet , rainy , to the wrong time , even though I had no high demands to a city which is attributed to the arter@@ ies with state security and their ac@@ comp@@ lice .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ms after the power supply in the fourth quarter stopped working .
I broke the silence by cr@@ ying several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice from the silence re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends closed to me ; we Con@@ feder@@ ate ourselves to a glorious picture that my expectations completely fulfilled .
in such a moment you become aware that you free the mind from the lamp , but it is not interested in talking to the t@@ ing@@ st .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is willing to meet us at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he placed on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can withdraw your voice after you swe@@ ar them all the way up until the office of the security service .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as me now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me listen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All &apos;@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only cour@@ ageous to cry when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ ated eyes wa@@ ited for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really do what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of that building .
maybe it was in my Tor@@ u@@ ity , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my thing as I said , &quot; I did not think that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never ceased to look at you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t shy away from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in sol@@ itary and his father equal with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ ench of this dist@@ orted proposition is to me today in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an se@@ el@@ ical torture that I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I sh@@ outing the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I was going to do with me .
then return by the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I conc@@ ede to all the details just before I support the room .
unlike other than usual , they probably have been assigned to a larger cell .
I have to share it with just one more separate prisoners and must immediately put myself immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I pushed back on an old @-@ proven communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; pro@@ sth@@ and &quot; was .
after a long hes@@ itation , he rep@@ lied to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells there was a respec@@ table man middle age , which looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness there is no distinctive face to me , and doctors are here not ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all the answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was laid in one of the great cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would be fre@@ ed if I stay .
liar .
gladly I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws that are lab@@ elled in the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the hor@@ ror , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of the ruin , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Thunder , &quot; reference to 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; they are here to be question@@ ed . &quot;
thus , the secret was successful : to protect the state security in front of us and prevent the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ s dial@@ ect - so they played their denomin@@ ation@@ on@@ table layout and made the narrow gl@@ view of their global view .
this is not a house that is here is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their K@@ lan@@ s into a hero .
I support the audi@@ ences and re@@ efs to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and stupid man ; at least he comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the facial expres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join so much more important with your life than to join this day edi@@ st and protest to demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , not to answer .
I can really no longer say when any ins@@ ults and sli@@ ders have become a friendly discussion for me to an ordinary communication .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to be pun@@ ished , pun@@ ished , although I had nothing done to make this punishment .
in all of its diversity .
his command is to te@@ ar as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which is probably derived from the clo@@ aks .
your ex@@ ecu@@ tion@@ er takes off your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you can not measure yourself with him and you cannot with@@ hold your hor@@ rors .
my hor@@ min@@ ie fell not yet enough , why she inter@@ change@@ able the tube through a cable .
during my first time I asked me if the investig@@ ator had worked before as a gar@@ bage dump , or if that was part of the normal working class .
they had four cables connected to each other to present us from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour three of them changed three of them while I was still in line .
I had lost my feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am .
the ex@@ ecu@@ tion@@ er re@@ marked the cooling , and found no free@@ zing why he used as a neighbour to an electric loaded stop .
flow through my entire body , enough to feed my whole area .
my semi @-@ naked body that lay out on the ground was the perfect electric gli@@ der .
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it probably has to have been so about midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again ; let &apos;s say this was my only option .
some hours left that came to me like minutes .
and then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the bri@@ ghtness meets the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I reply with the voice of an inher@@ ited young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be fri@@ gh@@ tened worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and Bewe@@ g dich , you will be imposed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always booked me .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ det on the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smok@@ es a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends much of his time in@@ doors , sometimes he s@@ ander on his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again and again to his couch .
but what one can rely is a cigar@@ ette between its fingers or its ni@@ cot@@ ine st@@ ained lips .
he lives on the top floor of his family house that belongs to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel ended up his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had to flee from her village in Palestine in which she had lived as fel@@ ic@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks their old @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of the Palestinian territory , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance but also in cities that suff@@ ice from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limitations and he can feel according to people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he isn &apos;t open , it swe@@ eps the American foreign policy a special circum@@ cis@@ ion .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war @-@ areas , anything related to his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; - so he referred to himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I do not think of my own lives , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then it adds : &quot; I think so , as I am a man , &quot; while he hat@@ red up in water , Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in that time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the j@@ ord@@ an law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a mug of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the loop of warm coffee and the wa@@ vering of the K@@ ent @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose is first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you take a look into neighbouring countries .
from therefore avo@@ ids it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - in order to not end in jail .
recently the Interior of Jord@@ ani@@ ens has cancelled a performance of the band Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Action front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Br@@ other@@ hood - argu@@ ed that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual front of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert .
the MP and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was said &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the k@@ ang@@ er .
many pret@@ ations that the engagement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , which is the most established legitimacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a das j@@ ord@@ an people considered as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to work for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply sil@@ ken Rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a clear trend of cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , that appears clearly in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex education to Lei@@ be , by im@@ aging his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex and have sex .
the image shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of a apparently conce@@ aled woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
in the past few years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Ehr@@ en@@ mor@@ de &apos; - the in@@ official outside in Jordan .
human Rights Watch reached its peak in 2016 . however , the number of honest@@ y measures reached its peak in 2016 ; however , the institutional infrastructure has been missing for women who have been able to viol@@ ate victims of or domestic violence in 2016 .
according to a law enforcement fight from 1954 , women , who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence , &quot; and for her release is often a long @-@ long bureaucr@@ atic effort , as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman is not going to happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s music has great popularity and is known to do not scru@@ b before themes which were in his country for a long time as tab@@ ular .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b argu@@ ed that his work is politically , ad@@ mits that he is his music , which is full of explicit incentive to sexuality , freedom and expression not from politics .
&quot; I come from the Nah@@ ost , Man .
I became wor@@ sen@@ ing policies , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the assault . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ th@@ ief &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of the songs that are political and political will continue .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , Het@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he not@@ ices that barely anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 .
2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya to notice later that his comments were tor@@ n down from the context , revol@@ ve and his opinion were cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but only a edited version , &quot; says he .
today h@@ d@@ ai@@ b bu@@ ys h@@ d@@ ai@@ b open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance on homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ts , a poet of the eigh@@ th century , which still remained in memory today thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : when Abu Nu@@ something that could work later on behalf of the cali@@ bre , in the eigh@@ th century could openly write homosexu@@ ality , why does Jord@@ an@@ ier unable to do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos;s L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash @-@ em@@ em@@ em@@ ary kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an news service took place several former government officials and members of the teaching association , with the ration@@ ale , they would have expressed themselves with comments in social media with the problems connected by deep in the country .
considering this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s opinion remains only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to re@@ think a structural re@@ think in the next generation of the Jordan .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a well ad@@ mired for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it looks great , thanks and inn@@ um@@ erable changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society .
ultimately dreams of H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dre@@ amed of not only of it , his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is characterized by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , streams and arti@@ cul@@ ous kinds of working democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that .
until it is far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to res@@ ist and thus also resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
this big , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ps are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
we assumed that it is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory states that the ar@@ mies of drums over a thousand years were overweight and from a time when the ar@@ mies of the West of Japan occurred in the northeast mar@@ ched to force the Indi@@ genous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi place in the kne@@ es .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to sn@@ ap a few great seating , that &apos;s why we have a super view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two soli@@ d@@ cars are to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori the T@@ uta Festival takes the only true one - and to spend a breath taking in this summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was here and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high scor@@ ing was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rare , outer appearance and body care were so important as in this story , as they help to stop the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the Fris@@ eurs .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us of the main port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road @-@ smoking and illegal drugs are daily .
one of the survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the people in this region feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to be more and more norm@@ ali@@ es into the experienced hands of hair@@ styles that can im@@ pose these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the cont@@ est@@ ant of the hairdres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts against each other to show who can create the most important L@@ ooks , as one can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook @-@ profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to send young people to un@@ n their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of receiving bad advice on training in the hair@@ dressing styles that allows them to find work .
motivated by these activities and the offering opportunities have seen do@@ zens of young people that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before March in March and reported on some of their achievements :

Colombia : love @-@ letter to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ä@@ fighters

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the paper &quot; love bot@@ hers to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ä@@ fighters , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love @-@ letter to people that we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel ch@@ ased to accom@@ od@@ ate affection ?
this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , young people to write letters .
only recently she was the land of a historic event and she wanted to help her part : after years of talks the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces in Columbus ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered the sign of the peace contract as so important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received for his mer@@ its the Nobel Peace Prize .
but before the Colom@@ bian@@ wers , there is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors who have lived for many years in il@@ lic@@ it , have been exposed to a military rh@@ et@@ oric and re@@ im@@ pose their arms around the clock , must be integrated into the life as civilians again .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to living in constant fear and in some cases in a deeper hat@@ red against gu@@ err@@ illa , they have to take part in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Kolum@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and would need to help the process of integration .
and this is exactly what they did , until now thousands of young people have written letters - love @-@ bot@@ hers to former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors - which are to be delivered personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the world summit of peace Nobel Peace , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Crist@@ ian the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , in 2014 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded .
that explained that we love the people that we love , on Valentine &apos;s thousands of love letters write , but those forget that they need much unnecessary .
he plane , he told him to share his love with people this year that necess@@ it@@ ates the most urgent commitments .
thus , the plan , letters filled with hope and support for former war@@ ri@@ ors of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and to establish a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war story to a common history of peace . &quot;
up to now more than 2000 letters were gathered in the context of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major towns of Colom@@ bian like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would give me a for@@ give
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19 .
a group of 40 students of the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Munici@@ pal Author@@ ities of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art From the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art .
the members of F@@ ARC stood up as they had done earlier to counter@@ act the commands of their leaders .
but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters full of subjects from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all concerned . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings can be through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between it , &quot; told the &quot; knowledge student community Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff in the govern@@ or of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after we passed the letters , a former figh@@ ter led me through the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa figh@@ ter .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ cks saw ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa d@@ amper who wrote something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed there was a m@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the thor@@ ac@@ ic chamber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said it anyway and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never before in my life someone has written something so nice , so I answer on it . &quot; that suddenly gave me the tears of the che@@ eks .
I embr@@ aced him completely and set me apart from the top @-@ head@@ lights .
maybe he was sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , the only way to keep him and his six brothers from hunger . &quot; I never thought that someone would give me a mistake for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society there with open arms for us .
until now , I have only learned how I must handle weapons .
but now where peace is re@@ igns , I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the pre@@ l@@ ude we came to students and a few leaders of the F@@ ARC to a panel discussion .
the students were all grew up as already war and the F@@ ARC already passed in secret .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how the social in@@ justice on the part of the state embr@@ aced the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to create a political party , we can help create society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this scale , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never heard heard and had no elec@@ toral law , and to recognize that people I have seen as Monster and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings have been turned around , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , does me sore .
but it com@@ for@@ ting me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage , give us something to teach us and give a smile and a hug .
many former war@@ ri@@ ors have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian@@ ans was made clear that after the dra@@ fting of peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
as long as there are inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are prepared to rise up arms and protest for their rights , and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now put on peace , in a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace on - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are ahead .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion .
with fri@@ ght , activists have experienced the reporting of recent months about the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by a D@@ amo@@ cl@@ ing over the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community has not been created only by night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is currently going on in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered international head@@ lines after reports published by the s@@ cour@@ ing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected que@@ er men arrested and they were pris@@ oned pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun st@@ ec@@ es .
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ lady , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
already since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they became educated , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group Tsch@@ etsch@@ enen was experienced by the ven@@ eer of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sabrina .
fear for their lives , she moved to the USA in the final end .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone took my help .
it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who put into trouble in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her he made someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he sent them to his ch@@ echen@@ ia friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just there , some shopping mu@@ til@@ ted from the back of my car , I heard a Male Extra : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned , I sens@@ ed something in my body , but I did nothing hur@@ ting .
then I heard one sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you still want to de@@ struct the family ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital in the hospital again .
apparently some women had getting everything and come to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a nur@@ se .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ w@@ ns in my right pul@@ mon@@ ster .
OC Media : in which war@@ eh@@ ouses have you been placed - in the men or the women ?
Sabrina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , since my male name is still standing , but the doctor did per@@ si@@ fy and put me on the women .
I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a k@@ al name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has gone a respectful manner .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - kind@@ red , stran@@ gers , some totally unknown .
this was the start of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the requested to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all is a lie .
they placed absurd fears : some told me , I must prove it by going through the streets above , saying that I did not change my sex in the official TV in Gros@@ ny , and say that I was not changed my sex , that all was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have bas@@ kets size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some older people even spoke to my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only your family but the entire Republic .
we cannot st@@ ir you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you need to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she lay a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbours were and saved her .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with a black@@ ened window plate and a number plate with a 95 .
after the third time it happened , I was clear that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ aud@@ ited the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you flying ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give their names better , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but it happened something un@@ credi@@ ble .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I had arrived .
I bought her without regi@@ stering , without de@@ jovice , without everything .
I dis@@ ks my old SIM card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stran@@ ger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , do you war@@ n in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which Hotel du st@@ eck@@ st . they even know your ro@@ om@@ bi@@ ds .
just to prove to you , it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and sisters .
but over the opposite work , we do not talk , that is a tab@@ u@@ theme .
some traditional k@@ au@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements still sc@@ ales in me .
as much as I wish , this se@@ el@@ ical barrier can not be overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera I don &apos;t give me trouble , like the person remember@@ ing , remin@@ ding them from their past - meaning to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who are happy ?
Sabrina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he closed a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
so that my I , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are also currently det@@ ecti@@ ves men in these sec@@ rec@@ y ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says there would be no very many .
if , then above all those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives , to make itself cad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they will be held there so that you can present them later as terrorists .
say : if they are re@@ produced , they will show their body on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military bases .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically immersed in order to be radic@@ alised .
OC Media : is it only a version , or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just got someone who was det@@ ained one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew .
there has been nothing new since you .
they have simply taken them with them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was by himself as these people were with@@ drawn .
until now they were not presented as band@@ its , there have been no reports before . however , we suggest that such actions are quite possible .
why else could not allow these people to shave ?
know whether this persecution and ab@@ duction of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have occurred in the past ?
Sabrina : I always carried hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think even before 2003 I was already known quite big , when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , then it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but finally has left us back into the St@@ one@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were drawn ; I had colored eyelashes , carried tube and short t@@ ops .
the security of the sh@@ aria has never even scr@@ at@@ ched for me alone .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , mainly on weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people there met .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase of phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte do not say about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
you often say it to children if people feel funny .
OC Media : so do they just have their eyes closed before you because they believed , you be sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they have never sinn@@ ed , never sinn@@ ed , and never batter@@ ed .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ome time held ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row appeared to the plan .
when he was appointed as Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on television about mor@@ als .
he did not talk about us , but pre@@ dominant about the behaviour of women .
still - you could sense how the people in the city started to change .
who@@ ever sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , regarded you at once with suspic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could sense how the situation in the Republic is constantly wast@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
not much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much .
apart from that I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ ups , meetings , I walk them to the hospital and help them to get Es@@ sen@@ Cards .
I have no c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people myself when I sco@@ red fe@@ ed@@ te .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : enter a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
so nature , this is purely nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to make you clear with foam before the mouth , that there are no sle@@ wing in them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ar@@ din@@ ers have which Russians have also which ; all the planet there are - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is me uncomfortable , so what to hear .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practi@@ cing Muslims , who go to the mosque and during the Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
know , many think about tran@@ sist@@ ence to men who love men and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a Tru@@ st@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sens@@ ations in order to be precise , different li@@ fest@@ yles .
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will get here as personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n against an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian spirits region suffer from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate among the native Arab population .
for the past few months there has been a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ ants .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was made available by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran which is characterized by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had one child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the South@@ west of the South@@ west of Iran .
he denied under anxiety , depression , and he ash@@ amed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ ability to come up for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
one on the YouTube tag@@ ged Video kept the moments after he had en@@ ched himself , firm .
some people quickly managed to clear the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that occurred in August within the Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists locked away from the ground that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have a thing in common : there were anything family who felt due to the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ able , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of Iran &apos;s living in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community has been sh@@ aken by a deep @-@ reaching economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make their livel@@ i@@ hoods .
in front of a century , the Arabian Ah@@ wa@@ z was an mainly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took over power and 1925 great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran following oil and gas fields , as well as some of the weal@@ thi@@ est and most valuable areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy develops only slowly , and the native population is only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disorders , hunger and austerity .
the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically in their local oil , gas , and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a large number of dem@@ ons built , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories where the Provin@@ ces are Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m .
these dem@@ ons have only led to destro@@ ying the devast@@ ation caused in the region and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people increased to 81 % .
NO@@ UR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director@@ ate General for Co @-@ operation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished a job , finished 55 % a secondary school and 45 % a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an irregular Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high increase &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially acute unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z an@@ ew , new ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arab labour force , the local Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will ent@@ ail access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hood outside their homeland .
there are people who had to change their preferences and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and so that even Arabic names are not toler@@ ated , let the speech of Arabic , or the g@@ ages of Arab clothes .
given the given circumstances , which the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , the human rights activists , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is up@@ lifting and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
the following article is an over@@ worked version of the opinion which was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions have been expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I am no femin@@ ist , so many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they were wondering why I am not part of the movement .
they even went well through scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ists and why we should generally be all the feminine .
for example , that women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women still are under str@@ ingent observation , when it is about what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms continue to ensure that women arrive sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth roof , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still going across by the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that I am suffering from it and I am suffering from it .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I get to talk on skin color , to racism , on black CIS @-@ women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ pora ; if I mention , on which kind we have physically di@@ spar@@ ate , se@@ el@@ ally and verbal , both inside and outside the femin@@ ist movement , have left many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , however , all agree on that women - all women - come together to up@@ lift their voices and sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve gender equality ( some ) women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk that there is in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a institution@@ alised form of r@@ acy @-@ motiv@@ ating violence that we are exposed on black women in doubt .
or it is that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin places are less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls are referred to school with a migration background of the school as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spher@@ es and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as a white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men ever have any skin colour , the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot connect as a black woman , in whose centre is obs@@ led the white lady , which relate to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person .
I &apos;m exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere who has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
So@@ jour@@ ner bes@@ ought 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refused to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized being .
I refused to join me group@@ ings which also absor@@ b through cultural events of our s@@ lei@@ gh and h@@ oses to advance its eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer attempt to differenti@@ ate white women the importance of the reduction of skin color and sex . because some of them will continue to remain the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them for better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different homes and limit themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I prefer to get rid of myself fully and completely off by femin@@ ism and to join me to the movement of j@@ om@@ an@@ ism which is so per@@ ple@@ xed for a white femin@@ ist paradig@@ m instead of being celebrated for a white femin@@ ist paradig@@ m .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spher@@ es which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book of afri@@ cana pink : re @-@ con@@ quer us ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be consumed on the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists should call immediately separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist surroundings , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I &apos;m being recognized because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a part of this paradig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is not over@@ flowing , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution from Tod@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing agreement , this article will be published again .
over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution of his church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war , the construction of St@@ aud@@ emia , the pollution and un@@ controlled development to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - to help protect streams , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a sum@@ s the ur@@ gency and importance of his work together : &quot; if we had no water left , how would we survive then ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , fil@@ med and edited .
the focus of their work is on the ground@@ ed , little conf@@ lic@@ ated sub@@ cultures and is characterised by the use of co@@ operative vide@@ ography and new multi@@ media techniques , with their help oppressed communities , their stories to tell their way .
Paragu@@ ay women and their difficult struggle against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the we@@ eping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain over the women &apos;s leaders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . of course , the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ jer ( # so@@ f@@ law@@ ed ) , reported on the violence of women in Paraguay .
most of the names have been modified to protect the people concerned .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ar said Ada B@@ á@@ ez , that she could not do nothing about Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their excellence , who could have been violent against violent .
since the end of her relationship had passed a little time and the police said its statement would be placed to the acts , but more could not do .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena was made due to abuse , also the acute ad of Ada B@@ á@@ ez nothing .
a few days later the second lady attracted their ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women want to place at all once , they do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases women are also dependent on men suffering they are mis@@ led . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit that there will be victims of violence at all in law enforcement authorities .
content 1 b@@ lows and Statist@@ ic@@ s@@ 2 Un@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a judicial system that is nothing but action . Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women truly are mis@@ led , My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gen@@ der@@ issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various references and reports , which do not even show a substantial rise to the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
but the figures available are al@@ arm@@ ing .
in 2015 , at the District Court , 9@@ 600 ads went up because of domestic violence . at 70 % of it we went to violence against women .
86 % of the ads were killed by women .
there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence at the peace courts . here , 86 % of the women were killed .
in the ads said 40 % of women , that they were physically mis@@ led , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics however do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ an women &apos;s Lady Bai@@ ar@@ di only few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on any woman who are re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay due to psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who are re@@ funded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained them at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a separate imp@@ air@@ ment , the enforcement authorities cannot be properly carried out properly how many women are ass@@ ass@@ inated each year by its current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s genocide in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay that was documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible fail@@ ings and a judicial system that takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name to him all of her former friends .
in the beginning she did not want it , but then after . this should be ber@@ ed for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos . but two years she en@@ du@@ red them the psychological violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zable the most severe forms of violence against women and at the same time :
I never thought that I would ever be victims of abuse .
if I have read about it earlier , I always thought that only women have happened to be under@@ estimated , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana useless social media to report on the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and several attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rh@@ et@@ oric , whether he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook user asked Mari@@ ana , why they did so long by Carlos and left him before .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have a certain degree of complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos that did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they mis@@ led them .
Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that are of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince them that it was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victori@@ as advertis@@ ements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against its former partner who developed into an un@@ covering legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ay laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good , but do not be applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill introduced by the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Für@@ s ) .
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the motion # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original formula of the law considers that Fem@@ izi@@ d provides an independent criminal off@@ ences to explain and tough@@ er to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text was changed in some points , in order to also gain the MEPs responsible for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently prohibited in Paraguay , and pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill introduced was planned , the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) processing costs that have to bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they just want to have the indication and want to receive a safe place to leave the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law cannot be effective if the leg@@ is@@ lators does not provide sufficient funds for this purpose :
in Paraguay that abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations .
there must be a re@@ think that violence cannot be seen as something Nor@@ mal .
who gives the facts in the face of this facts and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to outline in such a long time that abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law of the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been altered . however , among other things , a passage in cases of domestic violence has been cri@@ ed on reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gress@@ or to push his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fil@@ ing of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ as@@ sment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great back@@ stop . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in O@@ man still exposed to pro@@ hibition of a newspaper still attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of an order from the ministry of the ministry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is closed on the website of the ver@@ bot@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have concluded an independent Arab @-@ language newspapers Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he performs a one @-@ year imprisonment .
two other speakers of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i were also arrested and put before judgment , but later returned .
O@@ man has ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had sent his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state stre@@ ich .
since then , he played , besides his role as the only sult@@ an , the main minist@@ ries in the country : prime minister , defense ministers , Ober@@ ster commands of the Defence , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Minister of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the sult@@ ans is characterized by the persist@@ ant effort of security forces , in particular of domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public freedom , including freedom of press , limit and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , to be shy and det@@ ained .
the authorities pract@@ ise peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activ@@ ating their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and det@@ ention of three of their speakers last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since it was founded in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , had published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; on the judiciary on 26 July 2016 . it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court of Justice in O@@ man to raise a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including the hands of the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , he was arrested by Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the editorial Committee , issued by the ISS and were arrested by the Security Council on arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the dep@@ uty chief editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had acts as the editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
the newspaper was closed at a certain time after the information ministers had given the instruction that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first negotiation was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to pris@@ ons and ord@@ ained the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by the disorder of public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excav@@ ation of the state &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty on the violation of an audience and the s@@ lan@@ der for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j have been sentenced to three years imprisonment and pur@@ pu@@ n in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ als ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year professional ban was ver@@ ted against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine prize of 1000 Ri@@ als ( 2600 US dollars ) after making use of a information network to spread the material that could be a danger to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a deposit was arrested in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ als ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before judgment .
the Court of Appe@@ al spoke to Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dism@@ issed on 10 April 2017 after completion of his six sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he lay his one @-@ year sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ al Court also highlighted the decision of the ministry of the ministry to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n permit , the newspaper sees itself exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the information Minister sent a statement by which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the information ministers personally signed another directive , in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus the Minister gave more time to the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re@@ funding the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks to journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was viol@@ ated in recent times .
for further violations , such as the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin , and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of freedom of the press .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2 . to create a secure environment for the Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists will be able to carry out their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country ,
4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in O@@ man uph@@ old their right@@ ful human rights work , and without fear of fail@@ ing measures , including judicial bullying , can exercise .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ state organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of opinion and freedom of violence as well as the right to gather peac@@ efully , supports and provide shelter .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or even at all . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site . there are two reasons for a lack of healthcare and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences than elsewhere , and lack of investment for exploring these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er is Director of the Central Bank for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious re@@ perc@@ ussions in national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , at first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc@@ toral fel@@ lowship at the University of Pennsylvania , he decided to go back home to go back home to support the s@@ amb@@ ische health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. W@@ arri@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on the mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( Disclaimer : Dr. W@@ arri@@ er speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the s@@ amb@@ ische national programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory testing .
furthermore , I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic testing for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
G@@ V : what do you think are the important current science themes in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no fundamental research . we only set solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipi@@ ents , instead of being Ch@@ acher .
the solutions that we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it &apos;s even impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are also very well supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or want to draw on , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , the health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
G@@ V : can you describe us the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : many times , it is the limited speed to do things , and the up@@ set access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that magazines can only be made available to payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , the amount of availability and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers will change global food production worldwide
this entry of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported on the solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on bre@@ d already in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NAS@@ A A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was achieved only through his own inf@@ usion and the question of how many sal@@ at@@ ers can get limits .
but at the beginning of 200@@ 0s , he re@@ marked that more and more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented and that he was not able to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only used for individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to illness , a special red or green or cur@@ ton or cur@@ ved leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as cere@@ al or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trends , plant breeding , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food safety around the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mort@@ on is still a salad , however , he generally takes longer because his work is getting more and more limitations always increasing .
&quot; it &apos;s like being in a river a rock , in order to p@@ addle the p@@ ups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that this patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed any new sal@@ at@@ sor@@ te , because all the features are already pat@@ ented . so it makes as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants .
however , it is very careful and makes every effort to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
it has also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ eders ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space station ISS awarded the red &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ red@@ ge@@ ous in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station and eaten there . there will be testing whether plants are cultivated in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like it would come out of the IT area rather than from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , providing alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called into existence to make sure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and remain permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , in brief Os@@ si , us , U.S. bre@@ eders agree that others may use them freely from them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and sell them . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others that you buy seeds , to breed such their own sorts , and not immediately so@@ w them - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ente .
do@@ zens of breeding and seed companies joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
prospects of prospects for the prospects of life
for the emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed , and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds plays a role in major centers such as Bi@@ odiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by bre@@ d seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not occupied with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ented , whether vegetable , cor@@ n , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; who wants to buy the collapse of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which is offered in August or September 2016 . &quot; who is offered good , locally and sustainable production , should also know that the way of how this vegetables are bre@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nutrition sou@@ venirs without seed power is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the open source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to providing others to their seeds , and therefore , as opposed to patent , seeds , and plant characteristics are to be patent .

Os@@ si @-@ supporters argu@@ ing that the future of food supplies is com@@ promised , as the available gen@@ pool due to the increasingly numerous wer@@ ed intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always restricted to un@@ disp@@ le@@ ased .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive , in the Os@@ si , has engaged in their doc@@ toral work with gene@@ ous variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ ot@@ ten@@ ants are protected as intellectual property , which means it is either not usable or us@@ eable for plant bre@@ eders .
for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts as Lu@@ by suggests that mass@@ aged plants like wheat in a much more pat@@ ented style are pat@@ ented as a salad or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of view
plants become so bre@@ d that they deliber@@ ately have imagined characteristics - from such a way through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in specific environments and threats such as p@@ ests or disease .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders are increasing by more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently unnecessary , but ever before , since the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse than predic@@ table .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to believe that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four co@@ v@@ ings and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company has advoc@@ ated the preservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts the view that spiritual property should foster other bre@@ eders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant varying innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that can be followed every once the patent is expired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others with another method to come from the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , such protection has not in@@ hib@@ ited innovations , but also promotes it by providing the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees that differently : 20 years waiting until a patent lasts , is certainly no innovation .
and if you are waiting for such a long time to grow to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , it would have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general public and remain to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us and it will make us impossible if we can &apos;t continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mort@@ on pat@@ ches itself on the concept to patent @-@ how , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the features . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants make them out and as bre@@ eders have ultimately no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the U.S. @-@ State Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ d a sor@@ row , bre@@ d his own values in her .
who@@ ever believes in industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ o@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass@@ ages are needed Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , bre@@ d in his varieties of farming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some moderate companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , make use of most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they stop it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for in his Bre@@ aker Sal@@ ads .
photo of Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders through the prevention of plant patent would be innovative , &quot; It looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than businesses that are patent .
I always need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent it is 20 years ago by competitors , what makes sense of my opinion very beautiful simply . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
while the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept now spread itself quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , &quot; ) which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , an &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed program works the center with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Organization Programm@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; license which ultimately has a form@@ ulate and legally binding form of Os@@ si @-@ obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for the breeding differ from country to country because of the Os@@ si obligation is not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the European Commission , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ented . in this way , it is opposed to the current practice of the European patent , patents on conventional plants allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law , but now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to the pat@@ enting of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; Program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conc@@ erto systems , that the organization currently establishes a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for the planned next year of the official start signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger of environmental and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit @-@ development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on Ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed good and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of the food - a bond of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - publ@@ ishes a report that farmers have the opportunity to improve and improve seed policy and ensure a stable supply of foods .
in the report the importance of diverse , local supplies is empha@@ sized for sustainable nutritional supplements - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si , that will soon realize it more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods mainly takes care of where and how something cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to clear the human being that even more behind their foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still the Egyptian authorities are still un@@ locking content on the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on weekends around 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government reported the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on them .
August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where it is crit@@ ici@@ zed by the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remain ab@@ usi@@ ve , despite this attack and the prosec@@ ution of the Egyptian law and defending human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as difficult as it now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are postpon@@ ed to overcome the sperm and not to im@@ itate to meet our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored site of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities established more than two months 21 websites , like b@@ sp@@ w. the independent news page of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar , network of Al J@@ aze@@ era because of alle@@ ged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web @-@ side@@ ways to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I also exists on the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and Human Rights , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access longer in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada has used his blog for the spread of Colum@@ ns and articles that he writes for in Egypt , not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up to handle the tongues @-@ apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
Blog@@ ger , the provider which is also housed in the organizer &apos;s blog , however , is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after spending in December 2013 by Egyptian security gu@@ ards , while he reported on the student &apos;s prot@@ rac@@ ed report , and recorded a video like the police of physical violence against two students .
his articles are primarily about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment he vo@@ iced Zi@@ ada to the inter@@ ruption by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs to block is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block@@ age of the blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege of si@@ ege ; a det@@ ained murder , sub@@ contrac@@ ted in the National Security Council , the spar@@ ity blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I have not in vain . in other words : my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to deal with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after having blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ zzle go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ thought and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 web sites . this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet service providers ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the inter@@ ruption from vendors , through the circum@@ ference of dormit@@ ory and Private Sur@@ fing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Net@@ works ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , 12 of June we noticed how the block@@ age of websites , the V@@ PN@@ s began .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content to the Egyptian users might have access .
the situation is additionally wast@@ ed that the c@@ ens@@ ings made behind closed doors , thus the Egyptian population does not have any legal basis , with which they can proceed to court against these actions .
now the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are meeting .

day after day , newspapers start in all of Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro were mur@@ dered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves smok@@ ed chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the Army , Navy and Lu@@ gen@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation the violence of violence reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian government @-@ government Global Justice and even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like this have become clear and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local paper .
the article published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced , a new column called &quot; war in Rio . &quot;
all the reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that will happen in any big city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , etc . whatever happens in Rio , will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision is not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war column in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video a journalist of the newspaper stated that according to information provided by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war discreet , if he is dist@@ orted , also can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , that sho@@ ots only and then ask questions to cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , its objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
are the name &quot; war &quot; more than it was useful ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil ar@@ gues the Journ@@ alist@@ in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliveira , to call the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy and could make it difficult to account with the police on account .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military deplo@@ y@@ ments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of public service .
to memory : the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most current data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per federal state , Rio at rank 16 , &quot; writes them .
specially belongs to the company Glo@@ bo , the largest media company of South America , which has stressed the security policy of the state since years .
these security policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose destination is to con@@ quer a F@@ av@@ ela by using a massive police force and to in@@ struct an unity permanently there .
at the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP def@@ ect the U@@ PP and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor coun@@ cils which should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under complaint .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo K@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio was not determined - the criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; established by Geneva Convention .
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war is also serious consequences for the human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls on the state to act and use the state which are typical for a war . this implies the penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and for the object of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ ses &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war hin or her , Fak@@ t is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .
a week it is now that the police with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho is er@@ kl@@ om@@ m to tra@@ verse the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident took head@@ lines : an or@@ char@@ ist died as a result of shots that had ma@@ stered the police from a helic@@ opter .

since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal de@@ ag@@ itation and block@@ ages , mainly through the Assad regime towards lo@@ y@@ ale troops .
according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ ew@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly strong , where a attack with chemical weapons ordered the life of hundreds of civilians on August 21 , 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition have passed , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ ac@@ re of Assad &apos;s regime has been pract@@ ised .
since 2013 , these were raised by rebels controlled areas outside of Damascus , which resulted in inhabitants tailored to local or through tunn@@ els and check@@ points .
for years of long block@@ ade are traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large portions of the population .
as a counter@@ party , a group of Syrian humanitarian hero@@ ism and academ@@ ics , the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can cultiv@@ ate their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the conventional ones in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the bel@@ ated East gh@@ out@@ a .
the Dire@@ kt of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for that project for three years , and strongly expressed his relief to win that it is now more and more .
to collect money for the initiative , take advantage in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge for plant@@ ing fung@@ i , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 , but will continue until Monday , 04 . September 2017 , continued to collect gifts to Can@@ do .
the initiative is reli@@ ant on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city , locally generated fuel are used in plastic to provide generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pilgrims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . when they managed , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have made mushrooms everywhere in the east Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the mush@@ room breeding for various reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break of the si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires in 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ed on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and called for justice to the victims of the fires that are gr@@ ac@@ ited in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ four people died , and about 70 were wo@@ unded as a result of the Wald@@ br@@ aces of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the Government Trial last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a stat@@ ute .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ um in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ bur@@ sts that spread out in the north and centrally located regions of the country and reached about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
in June there was a similar tragedy in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 deaths .
according to the European forest monitoring system that monitors the forest @-@ surfaces by satellite s , are burned only in 2017 in Portugal about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest , a surface of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of Ernst &apos;s position : there are only in 4 districts no fire .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the goal of the protests on Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why civil protection was not able to em@@ ate the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al from the Federal Government of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dirt reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could happen again since the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction @-@ approved in est@@ r@@ ents are question@@ ed with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a far @-@ reaching suggestion for the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which had introduced the government after severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was filed by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a de@@ ath@@ ing of the law that has been allowed to allow the appropri@@ ation on funds to self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus made aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , itself , as in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires this kind goes on .
regarding these problems comes the website of civil protection from Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , as local residents were looking for or tried to contact bonds , offline .
it was a private initiative , which cat@@ ered the people with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João P@@ ina to simplify the work of fire@@ men , and was in this fat@@ eful weekend in October so scor@@ ing that the servers followed the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who kept the fires , did not stand the site more than half a million access .

the Taliban for their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara , were always approaching .
many Haz@@ ar@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal @-@ pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wage , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a strange country along with other refugees and to@@ pp@@ ies with mort@@ ar , the he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ i@@ hoods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then how today was life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran characterised by dest@@ itu@@ tion and exploitation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; remembered A@@ co@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site , on which we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we covered n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so we won &apos;t refres@@ hed at night . &quot;
after four years he left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
when the dangerous passage on the sea suffered cru@@ ising and stran@@ ds on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ lig@@ ent 2002 came to Italy .
some time was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that distributed twice a day eating for the need@@ y people .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high availability quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . it is also true that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation of Civil War for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ imagin@@ able staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an exchange center when they officially asked for asylum from the registration of asylum seek@@ ers , which can still be registered after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers .
until then people who have no money for accommodation , rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
it is so erg@@ ing it also as@@ har@@ f .
but his un@@ think@@ able li@@ fel@@ ong helped as@@ per@@ ish , to soon liber@@ ate himself out of these conditions .
after spending several years of working in the construction of construction , A@@ co@@ af awak@@ ened its total savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice .
this went so well that he opened after a while still a second hostel and a snack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ nick@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind Vene@@ tian luxury - one Ha@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film won the Venice City Award for 2017 which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
there is a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the path to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans built companies , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some af@@ gh@@ ian restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the chef has mostly made refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes , the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims are far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ers and retail stores and aim to go back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ co@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happ@@ ily when I know my people suffer .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest countries in the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same options as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; As@@ shar@@ pen also for@@ ging plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and preser@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ co@@ af has made this journey itself . now , he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill introduced that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users would have to use the social networks within six months within six months of the authority of the authority using their full name and exp@@ ul@@ sion number . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who@@ ever failed this step might be sentenced to six months imprisonment or be condemned to a pun@@ ishing withdrawal .
the law , which was advert@@ ised by six@@ ty members of the Parliament , is currently under legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and will be deb@@ ated there .
may &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by May there is another proposal to become a proposal of proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the President or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law the insul@@ ting of the President as well as state institutions already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the legislative proposal , such legal experts from Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly is already in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) of 13 August 2013 , while holding violence against demonstr@@ ators , demonstrated against the military coup that fought against the Military coup d &quot; President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited , as more than 700 protest@@ ers have been arrested by the same incident , four years imprisonment on a court appearance .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May because the pris@@ ons according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison in court .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty on the basis of a , so many human rights groups agree , flas@@ hing of other weapons property , illegal assembly , murder and ad@@ vers@@ ed murder .
in another case a criminal court spoke in Giza the two journalists h@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage for the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat @-@ block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested in earlier incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists spoken to en@@ ched documents
may , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation by Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform N@@ awa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly h@@ ated to a sear@@ ched action plan . said plan deri@@ ves from the President of the Republic , according to the plan specifically a controversi@@ al bill , given to the busin@@ ess@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Shi@@ nest@@ y , provided these all un@@ law@@ fully preser@@ v@@ ated funds .
on 21 April on the website of N@@ awa@@ at published document , a light thro@@ ws a light on how the conc@@ essions plans to support the template .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia delay the nomin@@ ation of his sources by providing articles 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press release , which journalists explo@@ res the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the district court in Tunis , on May 9th as a witness .
will China comp@@ el the users of social media to submit their reference ?
according to new regulations of the information bure@@ au of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write or share messages in social media .
in the legislation it is also stated that the registration will be necessary with full real names .
anal@@ ysts assume that through the elimination of anonymous comments in sub@@ divisions within social networks , it is still unclear how the authorities use these rules .
Chinese citizens have suggested within the social media to en@@ force these provisions only sel@@ ective in order to protect citizens journ@@ alism and independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; see you in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia has access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or def@@ aul@@ te We@@ chat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; register with the state government as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizational of the information spread &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this design@@ ation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government introduces a list of online services that allows the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to assume responsibility for removing content and force them on request for suspension of user data .
these web sites are currently owned websites such as V@@ kont@@ akte and od@@ no@@ classi@@ niki ( Russia two popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and the use of other services .
Turkish Court has Sper@@ ling Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
