<seg id="1">Although I visited the US for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American music was read about American music and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American movie journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrified reporter, who covered the supreme conspiracy of an oil magnates, who had the topmost confederation with judges, who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free after Method Man," "" "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish love hearing about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes down with its bottiness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks of, as a former colleague it expresses, and explained publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afrocans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million voices which he won with the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number, who reached a nominate candidate from the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigzy person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't get Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, the people from all over the world, a deep believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, the mumps of the worldview did not coincide with the present by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Sun" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mumps Intolance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced with Sandy Bahr who fought for their lives for the environment and her husband Dave, my host family that treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still she fits into the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then we were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise Council helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values are embodied through them my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While wearing his way to the nominate Republican presidential race, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps especially because of its contempt toward non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for wearing, because they either shared its racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to call the Trump voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">To assign the people, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their villages are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom have been tuned for Trump because they want to recover the control of a country that has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one cannot forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks up with contempt to those who look differently from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Andim. SC.: as much as' drawing of whites against all other ethnicities'; wordplay made of white in reference to the whites and whiplash what so much does like Schleudertrauma), as was the big Van Jones, exactly what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world cherish the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nonetheless a powerful idea - what belief or background you may have always like, America is most welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of an identifier, its history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "however, with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, is a huge part of the White America of this promise and says," "" "The hell of diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">In America, after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the ruin, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a wordchange with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a sound "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "grommed the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "have Latin inos a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" replied it.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called for their voices and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone who is not how you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an unanimous and vocal "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded by the words:" "" "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that brings me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music-school of Vicente Guerrero municipality in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played on both places not only has changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music which lives with the fall</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is situated on the edge of a big garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La Banda de m√∫sica (music bande) has now played in the municipality: one out of children and adults in the existing symphony orchestras, with their music instruments a way to overcome its surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school-school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest province of Mexikos, is famous for its drugs abuse and bananas violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered so rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the Musikgruppe very seriously, says the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to imitate their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come and play with shiny eyes and play with shiny eyes and play in the bustling you learn day for trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forehorn, Pauline, Bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the kids of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay capital - on instruments that are produced from revitalised waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recurring instruments, which consist of local fixed waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments at Cateura where the recycling headed by Favio Ch√°vez began to transform parts of apostasy into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, violas, Celli, contrabasses, guitar, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classic music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Ch√°vez, a local Eco-ologist and Musicians teaching the children of Cateura to the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsing and we had to teach at the same place where the children did not have music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed to be a favio something that he never had seen before: one out of waste-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments produced on instruments and that is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill harmonic" (harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance at:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces approximately one billion tonnes of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest people - like the men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music from the Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo ¬© FISH-i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports international, practicing solutions for environmental problems reported.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-release is done as part of an agreement with Global Voices on the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, there was already known that this ship had already been operated in liberal waters of illegal fishing, before the other coast of Africa was rising.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised, and little more inclined to welcome a legislative burglars of this kind on coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised himself rapidly against the ship. they refrained to him, one of their harbours, and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refuse everything," "" "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that was discovered and followed the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to lowering the fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which criminalizes practices and resources protects, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 was founded by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing eries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, which at that time had driven the prime minister off their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"we have eight countries that are like minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing," says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project ending illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, what is extremely difficult to enable. in this way, illegal fishing is a major event of the overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the intentional decontempt of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may have its delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing has been hindered by bureaucratic obstacles and also through the snail damage, with the information between individual countries, these actions occur in real time, with traceably to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange lists together for example lists, news to digest activities or details, which one had noticed or experienced during a longterm prospects.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open lake through satellite formats.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, as suspected routes, such a ship suggest that a ship invites its captured fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the way, and possibly also, whether they have a penal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can deny the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to be forced to claim sanctions, as in the case of prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is a significant financial losses for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing trade is not worth making any more financial support." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, introductory Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The "" "" "" "the already mentioned platform was created to attract 20 million USD in lost sales, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate in East African waters." ""</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, present for the region of commercial fish-fishing from around the world. under these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">To their practices, including actions, such as sailing on false flag, fake license papiere, specification of Phantasienames, the fish-protected species and the fishing practices.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they are specifically using the missing international cooperation and make themselves the weaknesses of an incomplete control system" "", "says Long." "" "a ship was illegally fish and a country could then say" "" "you can't walk down my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say 'Comm to me'." "" "and exactly this legal lostril tries to close the FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of demonstrangers.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks who had fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has escaped ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with Interpol, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over major distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that is supposed to help the FISH-i more suspicious ships of precise locations.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's Satellite system that will always be developed, also helps to send illegal ships to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishing use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "", "says Duncan Copeland, Editor-analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NRO, which also deals with fishery data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">For example, some of the ships turn off for example its automatic indentification systems, which can no longer be produced by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that combines different information levels. it is supposed to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">However, FISH-i's team can actually influence any influence on the unquestionably global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, Skyline has launched a platform to Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world by means of every single foldable ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - this is simply sense," "" "says he." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at global level." "" "ew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, where a global System allows the persecution of ships" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel crime but they also cringe.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships used to be fisher without license and hardly to reckon with consequences, we now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries participating in FISH-i involved a 33% increase in fisheries rate, ever since fishing boats for more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 record, the inspectors found there on board the tow rope, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "also other countries notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study subject." "" "in West Africa a year hundreds of millions of dollars by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there, 2015 six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also they are now fighting the illegal fishing, based on the same model as FISH #." "" "safety is the goal of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia put his first great triumph: in October it presented Greko 1, a ship that was on the wrong flag. and not just the ship was also used without a license and were used to tow.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the Take of measures against Greko 1, they put a strong sign that they precede against illegal fishing," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such special, collaborative methods work on the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world sea.

<seg id="201">In the process, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined, who were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not look for his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the B√ºrde, same name as his father wear, to the brutal lament in the prison of La Perla, he was watching enough in the age of 15.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family longue for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that was all right.</seg>

<seg id="207">When a child under the age of 15 cannot be seen that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, Folterer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was gendarmerian. during the Argentinean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father died from 1976 to 1978 Deputy Commander department, 141 in the prison of La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide circulation of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For over one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the output text and communicate active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native language. in general the conviction that translators is in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">In this way a French mother tongue translator was translated into French by English - not by French.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue, translations into the English translation. this may not be attributable to an understanding of the survival, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that will be Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees to make translations into the company internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best, for the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verted and puzzling phrases which are developed by machine translations, demonstrate that this technique can not replace a human translators for a long time. this applies to several languages quite particularly.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling pprints which often uses T-shirts or bags, are used only for stilistic reasons - not read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. but by large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translation.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses in future hopefully a serious source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="425">This is referred to as Criadazgo, in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance of large sections of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">According to completion of their studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls.</seg>

<seg id="428">She tried to call things on behalf of the name, as the sense of gratitude, which is vaccinated the Crimean itas, is guaranteed to be silent in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," says Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who carry out their daughter in faith that she can so close their education to improve their position in society and can "make something out of himself."</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, which takes the girl in himself and justifies the exploitation of faith that they give someone a chance that would otherwise not get education and maybe even be starving.</seg>

<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita in the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer Alvarenga worked out between four to six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so she had to share the time so that you still remained time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up at five o'clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays for example cleaning the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they finished with learning, the more leisure time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says, she never had to hungry, but also didn't get unbounded food. "I was allowed to pick me more books from the library of the landlord than food from the fridge," she reminds me.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathetic of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">To some evenings of householder Alvarenga, to stand in addition to him and to read editorial from Oppositionszeitungen as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade her to give the reports of the official media on the regime of the dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">He held them for intelligent, but did not believe with her. "the landlord had found someone who spoke, while he spoke about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would be learning there again" poor habit. "so they argued that Alvarenga that belongs to the indigenous group of Guaran√≠, home once again their native language Guaran√≠.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that she would have made her way of losing her again, explained them.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was perfectly clear that she got for everything she got from them, with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in the school Alvarenga is discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about, are bullying and the bullying, which criaditas are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that anyone who has no parents, a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to me at home. I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, at the time, where friendships arise, I feel particularly clear that I was not one group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of everything, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="540">Shiphrawa was devastated on 11 March 2011 by the tsunami and still has the region engaged in reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In the beginning of March 2017, the dedicated daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years to reconstruct the lives of those who had been affected by the "Trinity" of March 2011. a vast earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai that is in the prefecture of Miyagi. prefecture of Miyagi was a great prefectures in Japan. both of them had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring przapping of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuated, for the tsunami had whole seaside towns away from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Yet the prefecture of Fukushima had already experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of Japanese reconstructors as well as survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (Shionana, Beer, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the preftures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi's biggest success was able to record Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has 75 percent of such houses finished, whereas Fukushima has 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, one still makes every effort to continue even six years after the catastrophe, Evacuated by Behelfsshifts (Red, Warsaw, kasetsu juutaku) in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in containers.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of those in 2011 Evacuated from Fukushima lives still in emergency accommodation, whereas Miyagi was successful in this case. more than 75 percent of the evacuated, which rests after the disaster in containers, were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three countries concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper, 1074 were affected by 1100 schools, which were affected by the unjust until December 2016, which almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">"" "" "" "six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three Prefectures is much more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, have only 30 percent of fishing ports in Fukushima only 30 percent of fishing ports.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomy accident, have been in the three Prefectures of agricultural land in a coardent.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, whereby only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of non-agricultural agricultural areas can be used again in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic accident is, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed in Fukushima, are located in the "nuclear pluszone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, the tourism recalled along the tourism, but also here Fukushima stay far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, only 75 percent can be found.</seg>
<seg id="568">However the Kahoku Shimpo-newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it is harder to feel their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain a total image, the paper conducted numerous fragments among the native population and under the evacuated. they asked them over the state of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about tsunami consciousness under the domestic people.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey took that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 per cent of those surveyed that were still not done enough in the catastrophes of disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to be evacuated out of the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In her edition to the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also increases its attention to the position of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to take not only the giant earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witnessed, nuclear, atomic facts, nuclear accidents, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated by Fukushima almost 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, somewhat more than 23 000 people, have been moved back to Fukushima, in long-term spare parts of the country.</seg>
<seg id="580">At the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the Katastrophenland, most of the evacuated buildings are still in containers, older than 50 years old. they must compete internationally for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. here it is building projects, which are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widely spread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">An Brazilian student at the age of 33 were delivered this week into the intensive care station: last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Goi√¢nia with a pstock against the head. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied Social Sciences at the Bundesuniversit√§t Goi√°s, has suffered a skull-stag and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on this Saturday and have now put him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">Its condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local educational journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, who rapidly spread rapidly into Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">In the pictures the face of the police officer is also identified with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian city of Goi√°s, known that Sampaio had been perpened until the conclusion of the investigation of the event of the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he suggests in Goi√¢nia with his punch on the face of the students Mateus Ferreira (Photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">Would a police officer audited by a demonstrator and land on the intensive station, his face would be able to see six months on television and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a press canals of media activists from Goi√¢nia, divided the video that was attacked by Luiz da Luz, in which one sees how Mateus was attacked by the police officers and several outrans briefly to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but from a different perspective is also filmed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the shown clip one sees the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another federal state, Internet users have become 10,000 Brazilian Reais (about 2,500 euros) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goi√¢nia while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goi√°s experiences a wave of political force: here the activist prisoners was killed by his father, because he joined the Occupy movement of a WhatsApp group, and here we have been attacked the very sad event of Mateus Ferreira since Silva who has been attacked by a policeman, having attacked him by a policeman, who has beaten it with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police-grips</seg>
<seg id="615">Goi√°s was not the only state in Brazil in which last Friday took a brutal police force against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen put at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had erected a stage for Redner, Gummigrosse and Tr√§nengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Zerafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), the police called on speakers to renounce violence against demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="627">The community community Gregorio Arle√© Ma√±alich, located in the western cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugars - irrespective of what there is no appreciable sugar harvests on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar beet factories were buried.</seg>
<seg id="629">After receiving the sugar beet industry was silent in the region, and the factory lost gradually and after its installations, until only the scaffold made up of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some rarely changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and pendent daily to the factories that are still mahlen.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, which rises every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugarbeet industry does not smoke his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the east of the region of sugar beet factories, which are in operation after a long inactive time, because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">This was something that he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly heard that in Ma√±alI would be preserved the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar supply industry had already resist the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiencies and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced amount.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motif for alarm for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests have already been no new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugarbeet industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway walk of the church saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugarbeet industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugarbeet factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive, they were intolerable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on the production on the most effective factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">You only left the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives, which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugars on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar prices increased about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of inrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound remain, according to the 2016 published report "agricultural perspectives" of the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and nutrition organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3,6 million tons), the pipe-export would bring about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day is certainly in history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the factory factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the lactation of a total of 98 sugar beet factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the Burohrfabrik Gregorio Arl√©e Ma√±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto P√©rez was working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talking about the closing of the factory, the word he repeated the most, "sham."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">So that the place is received, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first lap year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially comprised of documents occupied with regard to the parts that would be removed to address the address and date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, just the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording of a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations-Communities all over Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them. they do it with Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour have been producing mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres, to teach youth groups, songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were headed by the Pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree-communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing the young participants in conversations like "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self acceptance, or whatever comes the mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos that young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitchenkalum First Nation in British Columbia relates, for example, the history of the highway 16, also "highway of the tears," in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video games to convey how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs despite influences by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people are not always dominate the languages of the first Nations language.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree first nation has taken, the refrain on the ree is sung.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters involved got a little help from Gary Jolly from Northstar Hip Hop Group who gave them a Strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree lieh.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebooksite of N'we Jinan is at your disposal the Strophe in heading, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go further my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take up our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise by one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and take advantage of our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how you can do what it determines the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary box, the reader and supporters of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the Strophe in Silbenschrift (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see almost any restaurant sculptural dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly on the menu, which is exactly on the menu, will be issued close to the entrance shokuhin sanazu (hike, known, "plasticizing models of the dishes") of each dish which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plastic courts and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic surgery.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that produce just those sculptural dishes made by the German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese people these plastic debris usually that they are not even striving to them. however, a new trend is turning it today in conspicuous cell-accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photographs that make this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic-made decorative panels, as they are shown at Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned to kitten collective articles, as in this case, refrigeration magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shoft Cooler's magnets for a new exhibition at Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the Esseniments is increasingly increasing.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular travel bowl with seafood) turned into a mobile rack.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we have found as a mobile-stand a good use.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we prepared for the exhibition at Tokyo's train station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that puts your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to watch as an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing bet.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile phone designers permit you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon are used, a popular topping, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon betrayed?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts may also take a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our new cell phone stands has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also motorballs (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried fruits.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further skursical plastic debris you can see at: itinii's Naver Lome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # 1, Translator, „Éó„Éä„ÉÅ„É•„É©„É≥.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports, and foreign media via the infamous "fight against drug-trading" in Mexico, the missing and disappears regularly only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which brings this struggle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting about drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzm√°n, the head of the Sinaloa cartels, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict totally in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent attack, there is hardly any one looking at the sadder or the congregations that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind each row, behind each bone, the stories of loose parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds might never be able to heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Pol√≠tico developed the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug-trading"), "which aims to give such victims and stories of people carrying out the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Pol√≠tico, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in central mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that your violence should never be considered normal, no matter what shape it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensors for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to Timisoara every day and see the titular pages with images, which actually only can be from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the Only, the indicated or sad. it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body once belonged.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-old cousin thinks that he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) will be if it is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories go to mere figures in a statistic section.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inplessness of the people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students in a neighboring town is justified that they were" "" "intermittedly" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they attempt to talk about such tragedies when they are not stir and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months extortion in the main city district:" it describes how armed crime month for month money was destroyed by their business, until they end up not only the shop but also their family had been torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life completely within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain over it never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes back high if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also have.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, as one does not know when they will cause you or to kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these frightful days whether I would solve my deepened feelings, but the reply is no, because I forgot how to wept. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Guti√©rrez Vega published the contribution "Die verforgotten Kinder von Ciudad Ju√°rez: one of violence emerged."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a mixed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexikos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other young age of his age whose parents worry about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a commodity and he told him to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies which live with him. this is his name for preparing the flooding with water, sugar and milk pulley.</seg>
<seg id="804">He relates of the nine fools on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one said to him that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years ago when he was just a few blocks from his home, the bloody lyriche of his father saw that shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Ju√°rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence is organised by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju√°rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Ju√°rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of charges for public security and the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor of 3103 Morde. this is equivalent to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands stories that organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in view of ever new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those that we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" has established the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading that has tortured the country over the past four decades, in a intelligible manner.</seg>

<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a petrol chamounted to the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte around and exploded. there, 230 people came to life.</seg>

<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities in front of which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and surname in streets and bushes.</seg>

<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one's back to count on to count," "" "said a resident to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were carded, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only in order of satellite images, the Folgetime could be imprinted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unsolved, but the army staff in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigths and the attempt of Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo has emerged again, as proof of the fact and the potential scope of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">You are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abnormal use of the image from the DR Congo is only a number of misclaims; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all of these cases the image has been presented as a testament to mass evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments like this example is mistaken the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also joined in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a Blitzmessage, published by the United Nations, those who could flee the saw, rape and any messenger, some of them.</seg>

<seg id="902">Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an abusive use of the image from the DR Congo, on the one hand a tweet, expressing sympathy compared to the Nigerian massacre, and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger, following claims, the Rohingya are persecuted to delve, since the photos of it were misused.</seg>

<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities were taking these events, which occurred in the name of Islam, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was wept as a testament to the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9.300 times retweetet). but the messages that were associated with it were raised in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to attract attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Portuguese), 2014.</seg>

<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original unbice of 2010, the picture is ultimately possibly a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are here two strong topics or frames (framing) which undergo these posts. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The picture was used in relation to larger discussions about silence related to the murder of Christians from Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assassination of the Rohingyas.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss, how a African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worthwhile to examine how pictures are used in the context of these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deepest question is what happens when readers could no longer believe this pictures.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are zig people that are unintended to corrode the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggested this mood of faulty and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and narrowly the actual Greys of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withdraws of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent images reader and audience desensitize and give them the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, which studied, like violent media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is quite a lot of serious representations to be discussed in the news media, the fact that they are essential for the current news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiments experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against 'Fake News'. you will have to think thoroughly about situation in which a picture suggests something, which actually is also dissolved from the context or on totally abused type.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false supplements should also take into consideration how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="945">There are such words in any language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>

<seg id="947">But all stubbornly stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or phrase does not suffice, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant to be with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have already been collected for quite a time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists are to deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, whereas the author and Linguine is of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog one can find words from plotlap language of Vanuatu, like:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - pampering you with your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, like:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after you warmed down on cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">You wear other cultures, revealing different approaches, and wake up our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you affect how to analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this site even want to publish more of these "unmatched" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity here and now despite a language barrier with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the number of stories in their original language possible.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Unalable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not on the written words, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and worthy of language variety of cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages do not pass to the children there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The massaging of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities to assume the diversity - secure spaces, in which people do not have to forget who they are to dave.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often is often linked to understand" "" "purpose these events instead" "" "listen" "" "to estimate and make sense to estimate." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers represent her story first in her own language and translate or then explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, giving their dedication and representation that the audiences can depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round the storytellers of Rassidatou are also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of the related art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fabel of the rabbit and the plum in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">Having asked the meaning of his foot, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is that to a public speaking your language?" with a wide ridge he divides his feeling of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling were taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a reviewing of public debt of Puerto Rico, who fought for 72 million US dollars, took part in a mass demonstration, the march started at the Spiikan Capitol, the government building of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de Col√≥n in the historic centre of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian westerer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But it is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives are continuing to campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's time: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture held in Berlin, devoted an event to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">M√©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist in France based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara R√ºhling, manager of the Book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inenquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was released last year and is licenced here, contains a series of psets that deal with free culture in the face of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are to be built and what the real costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researcher, and authors who have worked alongside the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to look over the fog that surround our newsletters and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to rid Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrating internet volunteers that has been indetained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled out of the list of Adra prisons in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about the current state or location.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, has many of us start thinking about their own destiny, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">Why did we decide?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time-wise extremes?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the prison syrischer government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to a non-known place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had based on the basis of a" strictly secret "armed command of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported it to be contacted on 12 November 2015 by individuals who asked himself as the insider of the Assad administration and put them aware of a so-called death-part against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Its location and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and wikipedia, Bassel played a vital role in making access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technical ologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project, founded the Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basel's cultural prototypes foresees the work that he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the hallway of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that at that time he could not know that ten years after working with this work, the IS would place everything because it stands not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in the digital archeology and the preservation has created a time-capsule that will invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Typically, Bassel has not yet been able to complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life with it, of freedom to dream and Bassel taught me to embrace it.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name nenne.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has shared his knowledge with everyone who has been asked. he has taught other incarnations, English to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me, both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought to other arrests, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without them being one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a reference visit, which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 her husband, when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They smuggled the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them from the Arabic to English.</seg>

<seg id="1228">It is happening with every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I reconcile eyes in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind in the moment, in which we embrace the poor,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers does not matter,</seg>

<seg id="1237">And I leave with you another piece of my soul...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return soon to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To return all the moments</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to smile over your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I convey to myself, that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the detention of Bassel wrote Ghazi:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year forging, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During the day</seg>
<seg id="1245">I in your cage I am,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still In the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">The story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bashar al-Assad are gone out according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrisky Network for Human Rights) more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared or executed by the regime, were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, since 2011 the international human rights organisation Amnesty International died at least 17.723 Syrians in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our call today in hope we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: because of corruption Verurteilter Director after release from release again to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambians dismissed with anger on a corruptive case, in which a ruling member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus at the state of state apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is about Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and 2010 together with four other defendants of 54 million Metikal (approximately 800 000 Euros) was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money originate from public funds from Mozambique airports, whose council Cambaza manage between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately demanded his reinstation into the company, which happened on 19 April then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the general prosecution of the Republic, the request quoted, there would be no obstacles in Cambaza again to rectify its old posts because the company did not run any disciplinary proceedings after its custody.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not agree well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Center for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade p√∫blica, in brief CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have undertaken a disciplinary proceedings against the resist-treated.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the firm seem to be however and prompted no proper legal action to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Eg√≠dio Vaz, a major voice in the Mosambican social media, rejects this behavior as well as regards the case as "resisting."</seg>
<seg id="1266">When Cambaza a competent type would be, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and then half of them eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He might pay paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since it is incompetent, he has constripped to become integrated into the company that he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Vile!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambikaner and Student of Political Science in Brazil says the director of NO morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza created from the state because he complied him, I cannot believe that someone is rewarded with someone in such a way that the state has already insulted so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morals to return and serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only serves themselves by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handover to become an inexhaustible money, and the state itself has become tired, which has been uploaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Ze√∫te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mosambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves is in the prison of Samora Machel will not only be remembered as a first independent president, but also as a sharp, one-board and - even in the case - prophetic redder.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous verbal representations was, when he confirmed, "an ambitious man is capable of everything, the fatherland for its ambitions, his own individual interest, sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience indicates that it is not that way. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is at the same time criminally. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also ablehnable:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat down 10 years and came free.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their post from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">"" "although on the origin of the word still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origins, or generally used as an adjective" "" "Indian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "(in burmesan script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise has been radicalised nationalist movements of the word an extremely remote connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that most often used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar's usually has to be associated with racism but the word itself is not calling for an automatically hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have questioned a doubt of his usage, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burmesical words with fundamental meanings which have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For instance, chair is written on Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (Spigbse), 'Kalar oat' (Kamel) or 'calarkaar's' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However he wondered his friends on a spiritual way, whether they wont know how he could relieve his back pain by doing a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "Heating" (ku) + the Frageword (la) to Burmesan - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hills is the opinion that they will be more radical nationalist nationalists, but it also stressed that Facebook must be analytical bends before it expose all the postures that can spread in the suspicion against racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook clears the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatic mechanism will not understand what you are looking at Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should instead do is to analyze the mail carefully and control it by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE"</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists have spread the Hassan, a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcised its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat, proved that the censorship of stroke is often a catchy and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply begin to use a new word or an alternative notation of the censored words to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to clear his posts, when he wanted to share his friends just that the word 'Kalar' is banned from social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a mail to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and it was forbidden to post office, items and parts of content for 24 hours because of the post "Facebook community standards was not unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of different kinds of people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the Hassan radicalised nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, who has nothing to do with Hassan:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author informed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more done before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmesan Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words must be censored only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they started without the local context or technical support and have been forbidden as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "heredcurry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they attempted to correct the randomly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a big turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of a lot of donkeys under the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now talking about Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassar 'to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook postings which have no written language, but nevertheless were removed:</seg>

<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks will include violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition, especially in the area of Rakhins where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape.</seg>

<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country's parliament voted unanimously decided which to ban this practice, so that it is now up to 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change in marriage, some members were arrested some members of Hindoo and Muslim religious communities in May 2016. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the interreligious organization (IRO), a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state cannot interfere, since that, however, age does not impose the maturity.

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15, in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 there were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">2011 confirmed the statistical central office of the country that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, who were eager to manage laws on child's toe, followed at the foot and delighted with great support. undoubtedly they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nonetheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu guide, such as had no concerns about telling the critics of the child's toe, they ought to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition catered for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and sometime soon questioned whether the opposition would agree with the bill of law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill introduced against the monogamy - despite four senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which included, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to approve, and the law is announced.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the Senators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill introduced against the children's e-marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having decided previously in the Senate, the draft can now become the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users was thrilled, because the laws of childbirth have been finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who holds a ministerial post in the Department of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary barge needed to wear the core of the matter, but do you know what? the nursery has now been illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson of mind was, it definitely was long enough to manage the practice, Lara Quentral Thomas overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which implies:,, Hervorous News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The spouse-etz has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota that belong to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group, which was fairly open about it, as important the adoption of the law noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The heating system in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious confessions 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft to change the spouse has been adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All Members who were asserted were voted for the law.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook occurs in the shape of Sat Maharaja therefore, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most well known Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaja has proclaimed his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be passed and he seems to plead his promises.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the general prosecutor Paris Al rawi, an advocate of law, meant to be quite legally, if Maharaj on the law would go forward, most social media users would like to deal with the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell struck before:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, when we, instead of discussing the discussion so broadly, in a way that we would talk to the state that the state, our daughters previously protects that they may be misused by major, stubborn men who are suffering from major, hard-known men who are abused to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children's toe is legal or continue to be the norm even though there are laws that they say.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By the spired of web pages, Turkish user can look at Wikipedia-content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia-page was indicted on 18 January 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey unlocks the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day will be more evident how important the platform for users is to get helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV-series wanders against the barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques-tested internet users are used to use condiversions for block tools (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), the most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been drained from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society on Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet has been adopted since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrorism (pages that are reflected in the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform made all Turkish Wikipedia-pages on its decentralized Peer-to-Peer-network (i.e. machine connections), which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship hard.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blomail IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (through the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything to put snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility of reading the contents on decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia Content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also involved that this step has been carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no Live- or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia participated in other efforts to deal with the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni by Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrorism from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to get similar mirrorad, if in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Pannirahi - Global Voices member as well as staff at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One takes to another URL, which is not the original. that which one can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia-page, so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even if they are blocked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him self-motivated himself to bear a camera with himself and try to ask the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring women to the international stage at the age of 28.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town right next to Chitwan National Park, it provides him with the perfect opportunity to shoot the photos of the Nephean wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, as this first-class situation helps with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had a call from my father received, that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">I immediately ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father saw him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was on the side and I immediately started to crush images!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to work with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it because he stand Tigers already from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can be bothered by the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because suddenly the king of the Buhek appeared. he immediately turns away, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar is placed the logo "I click for" (lit.: I clicked for the protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days long, and mostly lived in a tent in order to take place at the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, which live near the tourist resorts.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published as part of a content Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with greatest care to address the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronoun or say" "" "Father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh provide women to respect the husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should abuse the norm in their life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned to the Indian state Ooda by a headcourt and rejected by their family and the village community after they had raised a bloated relative name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also not call the name but is also widespread among men. however, they have far less admittances to fear, if at all, they should not meet these practices.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals, as well as housewives, a unique club and became quickly the main-on theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is available in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates for the destruction of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the exposure of practices, such as children's arms to the composing of HIV- and AIDS infected, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports on how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made ambassadors of change simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini presented in her panel discussion, was by women who did not call their husbands to name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation over the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"" "" "" "the name of their husbands did not speak according to the name of their husbands" "" "is a brialso that they have kept all duties and never questioned." ""</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman wants her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't keep this one is seen as a listener, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted, that we never had thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband so far, to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-in-law and my husband lull long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I shall call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in his luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the videoprojection the women sought to put the discussion with a practice in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they asked all, "If we can not say the name of our husbands, but they can call ourselves how they want, means that they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which she said the name of her spouses about the lips," says Rohini Pawas a centuries-old tradition, in which married women could never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy, that she was only outside of the whole exercise; another decided to settle the whole tapping into frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush, with an ancient brass also broken, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home their spouses of name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini was given a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in his head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her father-in-law she strained her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said, I must do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation put in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini tells how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred point on the forehead, which indicates the husbanding point:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband, that I would bear the vanization point if he did it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I heard that to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not yet listened to, but they say they are in a better position, even to choose him not to bear in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what to hear" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months, they celebrated her own birthdays in her life for the first time in her life; they danced and spoke about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things, for example, like our identities on our spouses, never to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things according to it, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only anchovies in the group since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them this is okay, but some wanted a salary course, a wide shirt above a pants, wear; they did not ddie.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of their own wardrobe, the morality associated with the Saris and much more, sloping feini her own pair of Kurtas (Upper hemden) into a panel discussion, so that the women could bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure they are going to make it happen.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the question, whether in the five months since her first discussion club was already changed, Rohini confirmed that things will slowly come into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have so far only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women just try it a few times but then listened to again to say the name of their spouse.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, make it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are wearing Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club knew that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hood to move more freedom of movement or their own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes back home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers community come out of unbounded groups in India and make videos about stories about which are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">These stories are "messages of those who live them themselves," and provide a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development requirements.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On 29 June this year, the Hashtag has been co-founded (The Beatles-memorial) in the Japanese market trend, where many fans replaceable memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in Japan occurred in Japan as a turnaround in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko who interviewed the Beatles 1964 in London, commented 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this has been sufficient to rotate the Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here really quickly became clear that they had no choice but to welcome the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached its zenith as the Beatles was coming to Japan for the first time in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cultband is "more than just a universal language like English," told Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! - Today is the Beatles-memorial in Japan. - 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today songs of the Beatles are sung by the Beatles in Japanese Caraoke bars and in the English teaching of Japanese mediumschools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Kitsch of The Beatles also survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is The Beatles-memorial.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love in our house The Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" Puppe John Lennon shall be present or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it belongs for fans, Japanese of course also includes pilgrimages to the known places, which are related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">And, If you love the Beatles, then you are all your 5 places you need to visit, or</seg>

<seg id="1591">Another group, the purpose of assassination for obscure is, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN enrolled out a mission in the South African country to investigate these practitioners.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published within the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the arsened Chinese border Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention in the international community after his attorney at the end of June had been announced that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (state risk) after calling on the design of the Charter 08, a manifesto that the democratic reforms in China was suffering.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China has said Lius Fall as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and a narrator, he said it as" "" "not required to talk about this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to give calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, redeem or allow him to have a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are fully exploited.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised several reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Pointer Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High-Commissar of the United Nations for Human Rights, met Chinese officials in order to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>

<seg id="1639">Norway for Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister B√∏rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius's liberation.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway were shocking in Stocks, after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 has been awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government rushed out that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations have been continued until December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon after China, since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message had been spread that Liu was serious, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an ununconditional release for the expression and lud Liu, to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his detention, he was unable to counter his price.</seg>

<seg id="1672">Taiwan on a Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the celebrations in Taiwan urged China on June 27th to release Liu and to show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party, called for China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to let themselves be treated in Taiwan.</seg>

<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was strict punished to have led to a harmonic, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged to have hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem duly, since Singapore is an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the judicial Minister K. Shanmugam was to be considered a city in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the Prosecution, the State of New York marked the minister that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered to be a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy be...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the judicial minister," "" "twisted" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercising of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and upgrades, this valuable land is to create, we hear that we finally have no land.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory hurtment.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons given by Shangrgam were not very posh: he defended the idea, according to what the political system of Singapore cannot be measured with other 'normal countries' in view of its, it was inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he advocates the idea that Singapore was compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian feasibility to be democrats, leave the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the final day, the answers to his American guests were given answers to his American guests with regard to our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions tarts he with non-responses of rational ways.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shangrgam to make his mind clear since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city is, in which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"" "" "" "I would be very grateful if our werter K Shangrgam would take the effort to clear this point where he was paid very much to be part of the city of Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1709">By giving Anon on the blog his comment, he points to the reviews that you should begin to read the entire roduction of the conference, so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shangrgam, according to which Singapore a city is and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the signing.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was more like a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore be so unequal, even if we are looking free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He adjourned in Singapore with cities in the U.S. (and how many of these cities saw a party at a time ago?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "be no country" "", "he obviously not meant to be in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan illustrates his disappointment at Shangrgam, who is as the leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the judicial minister of Singapore said, very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew about Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde who expects me - whether I agree with them or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts, and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he truly believes and his aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review zerts the vulnerability of Shanmugams Argumenten:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr Shangrgam" "" "coughs" "" "has committed a mistake, or was it a Freudite understanding?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the ruling class, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are more serious.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Your answers will be posted here as part of a continuing series, with the rumors about certain parts of the world and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for the Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">"" "the question I put in Japan most is that is:" "" "are you Americans?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry." I am from Canada. "since 1994 I am living here and back in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is regarded as being polite, interest in his interlocutor to show personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clarification then follow the default answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many canadians cook perhaps imminwardly against Wut when they are held for Americans but bothers me not.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that sets us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians can bring a canadic flag well to their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was even when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Trump before getting to Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always worn small maple blades at their luggage to differentiate themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="1753">With us there are no weapons!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada also is supposed to be considered the tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>

<seg id="1760">We Kanadier are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hasse that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, which I appreciated very much.</seg>

<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamps "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First of all: as "nice" to be referred to, is basically to be loosely - like the good-natured, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpson" (who has an own Canadian Doppelg√§nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" does not have any personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corner and edges, nothing, where you can come across.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and not deserve attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, remotely from the things around a around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, a main homage of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders as "kind" is perhaps simply cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open kindness, which I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice". our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year's Mexikanerin, a small woman with a coral glasses and gold-coloured earrings in teddyed form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitian who are on their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For around 2,50 Dollar the night sleep in simple rooms, with stole, crumble walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>

<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms Ram√≠rez tells people in full minibuses and the upper part of the coast start to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mom for Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it's rather quiet, but this year Ram√≠rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want anyone to refuse.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they bought them medicines that they can not pay, they massaged them with a balm that inherited from the long journey.</seg>

<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then moving towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard about other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a famous name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitian and the Africans are often travelling the way together and that the Africans speak at WhatsApp of Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>

<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa since months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bustuet after Tijuana.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities in the West of China are compelled to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi have received a mobile alerts in which it shows the District government, a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "the message is said that the app will hinder" "" "getting access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But k√≤es the authorities could also use the App for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had so short after they had installed the app, messages with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police that the app would determine the sources and the manifold ways of terrorists and follow, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, books and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang website describes the app as below:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective services with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic websites, from on-line fraud, Trojan and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they can spend online, and to remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors will help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" or even hacker can enable the home network of a person to manipulate or steal it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, pressing ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict-areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routing internet imcircuits.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The on Twitter-based Media Outlet "Images from mainland China" (Sing); the censored messages published in China, showed photos of a Checkpoint, to the policemen, checked the inhabitants indiscriminately as if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiang ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile messages notices that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint using a device without these software, they might be detained until 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a backbone for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have compelled the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest of the berwaching technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (i-‰∏≠ÂõΩ) published also published a Jingwang Product Information, from which the software can lift the password-performance of a Windows operating system and therefore has unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobiles will be available in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang are possibly a response to minimise the directives of the city party, to minimise the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental authorities, authorities and the institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communications devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">An up-to-date report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned this new supervision methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi released a regulation with the local residents and entrepreneurs, up to August 1st their "personal ID cards, handys, external drives, portable drives, notebooks and media memory cards" on the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is to identify and destroy any of these terrorist videos. however, this action is hurt the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole number of other possible contentment, including those referring to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib redet on the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends much of his time indoors, sometimes he sander on his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely is a cigarette between its fingers or its nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house that belongs to them since 1967; the year in which Israel ended up his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had to flee from her village in Palestine in which she had lived as felicyees (e.g.: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks their old-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of the Palestinian territory, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only in his hometown of Amman Relevance but also in cities that suffice from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limitations and he can feel according to people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he isn't open, it sweeps the American foreign policy a special circumcision.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war-areas, anything related to his identity as "Palestinian refugees" - so he referred to himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own lives," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then it adds: "I think so, as I am a man," while he hatred up in water, Nescaf√© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in that time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordan law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a mug of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the loop of warm coffee and the wavering of the Kent-cigarette in the nose is first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you take a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From therefore avoids it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - in order to not end in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior of Jordaniens has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action front - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual front of Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokesperson in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was said "just" because of the sexual orientation of the kanger.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many pretations that the engagement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, which is the most established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila das jordan people considered as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to work for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply silken Rhetoric, but actually a clear trend of crystallizing reality in Jordan, that appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional sex education to Leibe, by imaging his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex and have sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of a apparently concealed woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years Jordan has increased the number of 'Ehrenmorde' - the inofficial outside in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch reached its peak in 2016. however, the number of honesty measures reached its peak in 2016; however, the institutional infrastructure has been missing for women who have been able to violate victims of or domestic violence in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law enforcement fight from 1954, women, who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence, "and for her release is often a long-long bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman is not going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music has great popularity and is known to do not scrub before themes which were in his country for a long time as tabular.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib argued that his work is politically, admits that he is his music, which is full of explicit incentive to sexuality, freedom and expression not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Nahost, Man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I became worsening policies, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "" "takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the assault." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Gharethief" "" "is the focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are political and political will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words," "" "what you want" "" "- be it faith or non-belief, Hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that barely anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya to notice later that his comments were torn down from the context, revolve and his opinion were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only a edited version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today hdaib buys hdaib open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance on homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuts, a poet of the eighth century, which still remained in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: when Abu Nusomething that could work later on behalf of the calibre, in the eighth century could openly write homosexuality, why does Jordanier unable to do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou's Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hash-emememary kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be silence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even recently, in January 2017, the jordan news service took place several former government officials and members of the teaching association, with the rationale, they would have expressed themselves with comments in social media with the problems connected by deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Considering this, Hdaibs's opinion remains only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to rethink a structural rethink in the next generation of the Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has Mashrou 'Leila well admired for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it looks great, thanks and innumerable changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the jordan society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately dreams of Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreamed of not only of it, his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is characterized by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streams and articulous kinds of working democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is far, Hdaib will continue to resist and thus also resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was compiled by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which was listened to the Aman as a student.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">This big, extravagant warrips are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">We assumed that it is a variant of Tanabata festivals that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the armies of drums over a thousand years were overweight and from a time when the armies of the West of Japan occurred in the northeast marched to force the Indigenous people of the region, the Emishi place in the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to snap a few great seating, that's why we have a super view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solidcars are to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori the Tuta Festival takes the only true one - and to spend a breath taking in this summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Sommerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was here and I looked at the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high scoring was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus of the main port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road-smoking and illegal drugs are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">One of the survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the people in this region feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to be more and more normalies into the experienced hands of hairstyles that can impose these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the contestant of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts against each other to show who can create the most important Looks, as one can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook-profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to send young people to unn their arms against hairdressing tools and instead of receiving bad advice on training in the hairdressing styles that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by these activities and the offering opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before March in March and reported on some of their achievements:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love-letter to Guerillak√§fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the paper "love bothers to Guerillak√§fighters," which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love-letter to people that we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel chased to accomodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question went to the two young Colombian activists of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliaci√≥n (letters to reconciliation), young people to write letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently she was the land of a historic event and she wanted to help her part: after years of talks the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the FARC (German: revolutionary forces in Columbus), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the sign of the peace contract as so important that the Colombian President Jos√© Manuel Santos received for his merits the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombianwers, there is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warriors who have lived for many years in illicit, have been exposed to a military rhetoric and reimpose their arms around the clock, must be integrated into the life as civilians again.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases in a deeper hatred against guerrilla, they have to take part in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Kolumbians had to join together and would need to help the process of integration.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did, until now thousands of young people have written letters - love-bothers to former guerrilla warriors to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warriors - which are to be delivered personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the world summit of peace Nobel Peace, who took place in Bogot√° in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, in 2014 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="2196">That explained that we love the people that we love, on Valentine's thousands of love letters write, but those forget that they need much unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he told him to share his love with people this year that necessitates the most urgent commitments.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letters filled with hope and support for former warriors of the FARC, who now find their place in society and to establish a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2000 letters were gathered in the context of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major towns of Colombian like Cali, Manizales, Medell√≠n, Barranquilla and Bogot√°.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would give me a forgive</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the region of Caldono-Cauca on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students of the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal Authorities of Cali and Leonardo by the Foundation BogotArt From the Foundation BogotArt.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of FARC stood up as they had done earlier to counteract the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters full of subjects from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all concerned. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings can be through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between it," told the "knowledge student community Jim√©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a staff in the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the Guerilla fighter.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla warricks saw), I saw a guerrilla damper who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"" "" "" "I had afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed there was a mGL-Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the thoracic chamber." ""</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said it anyway and said," "" "Hello, what do they just do?" "" "he answered," "" "I am answering a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before in my life someone has written something so nice, so I answer on it. "that suddenly gave me the tears of the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and set me apart from the top-headlights.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Maybe he was sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, the only way to keep him and his six brothers from hunger. "I never thought that someone would give me a mistake for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there with open arms for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how I must handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is reigns, I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude we came to students and a few leaders of the FARC to a panel discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grew up as already war and the FARC already passed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC, the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state embraced the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to create a political party, we can help create society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this scale, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never heard heard and had no electoral law, and to recognize that people I have seen as Monster and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings have been turned around, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, does me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforting me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage, give us something to teach us and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo Gonz√°lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Dar√≠o de Jes√∫s Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombianans was made clear that after the drafting of peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there are inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are prepared to rise up arms and protest for their rights, and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now put on peace, in a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all defenders of peace on - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are ahead.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a translady, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Already since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they became educated, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group Tschetschenen was experienced by the veneer of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Fear for their lives, she moved to the USA in the final end.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone took my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a Transwoman who put into trouble in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her he made someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of mine. he sent them to his chechenia friends, with the following message: "then there is no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the round of WhatsApp the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"" "when I was just there, some shopping mutilted from the back of my car, I heard a Male Extra:" "" "here is a gift for you from your uncle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned, I sensed something in my body, but I did nothing hurting.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard one sentence, but this time on the Chechen: "how long do you still want to destruct the family?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had getting everything and come to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a nurse.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two keywns in my right pulmonster.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which warehouses have you been placed - in the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are deprecated, since my male name is still standing, but the doctor did persify and put me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a kal name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has gone a respectful manner.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - kindred, strangers, some totally unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the start of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all is a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They placed absurd fears: some told me, I must prove it by going through the streets above, saying that I did not change my sex in the official TV in Grosny, and say that I was not changed my sex, that all was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baskets size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people even spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world that not only your family but the entire Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot stir you because you are a pious woman, but you need to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she lay a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours were and saved her.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with a blackened window plate and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time it happened, I was clear that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends overaudited the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you flying?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to give their names better, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but it happened something uncredible.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I had arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought her without registering, without dejovice, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I disks my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think about, do you warn in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which Hotel du steckst. they even know your roombids.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove to you, it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But over the opposite work, we do not talk, that is a tabutheme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaucasian elements still scales in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, this seelical barrier can not be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I don't give me trouble, like the person remembering, reminding them from their past - meaning to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who are happy?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he closed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So that my I, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honour" has experienced by blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also currently detectives men in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there would be no very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then above all those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives, to make itself cadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there so that you can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are reproduced, they will show their body on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military bases.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically immersed in order to be radicalised.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it only a version, or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just got someone who was detained one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since you.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have simply taken them with them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was by himself as these people were withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports before. however, we suggest that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could not allow these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Know whether this persecution and abduction of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, have occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think even before 2003 I was already known quite big, when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to lead us to" "" "civil ization" "" "but finally has left us back into the Stoneage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were drawn; I had colored eyelashes, carried tube and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the sharia has never even scratched for me alone.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, mainly on weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people there met.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase of phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotte do not say about the unhappiness of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children if people feel funny.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so do they just have their eyes closed before you because they believed, you be sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never sinned, never sinned, and never battered.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnome time held?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow appeared to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed as Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on television about morals.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us, but predominant about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Still - you could sense how the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Whoever smiled and laughed before, regarded you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could sense how the situation in the Republic is constantly wasted.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">Not much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, meetings, I walk them to the hospital and help them to get EssenCards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I scored feedte.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: enter a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, this is purely nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to make you clear with foam before the mouth, that there are no slewing in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestans have which, the cabardiners have which Russians have also which; all the planet there are - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is me uncomfortable, so what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims, who go to the mosque and during the Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think about transistence to men who love men and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a Trustacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensations in order to be precise, different lifestyles.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will get here as personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is an overworked version of the opinion which was written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afrof√©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions have been expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am no feminist, so many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They were wondering why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even went well through scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminists and why we should generally be all the feminine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still are under stringent observation, when it is about what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms continue to ensure that women arrive sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth roof, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still going across by the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am suffering from it and I am suffering from it.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I get to talk on skin color, to racism, on black CIS-women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention, on which kind we have physically disparate, seelally and verbal, both inside and outside the feminist movement, have left many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "but, however, all agree on that women - all women - come together to uplift their voices and sing" "" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "" "to achieve gender equality (some) women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk that there is in addition to sexualised violence a institutionalised form of racy-motivating violence that we are exposed on black women in doubt.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or it is that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin places are less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls are referred to school with a migration background of the school as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as a white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men ever have any skin colour, the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot connect as a black woman, in whose centre is obsled the white lady, which relate to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and won't fight for my membership in a white-feminist sphere who has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner besought 1851 in her speech: "am I not a woman?" and I also refused to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalized being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refused to join me groupings which also absorb through cultural events of our sleigh and hoses to advance its egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer attempt to differentiate white women the importance of the reduction of skin color and sex. because some of them will continue to remain the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them for better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women different homes and limit themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of myself fully and completely off by feminism and to join me to the movement of jomanism which is so perplexed for a white feminist paradigm instead of being celebrated for a white feminist paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres which are created by us for us.</seg>

<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists should call immediately separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist surroundings, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I'm being recognized because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2487">If women want to place at all once, they do not receive any support from the state.</seg>

<seg id="2489">Content 1 blows and Statistics2 Unvisible Missions and a judicial system that is nothing but action. Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of implementation and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women truly are misled, Myrian Gonz√°lez, researcher for genderissues at the Centro de Documentaci√≥n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various references and reports, which do not even show a substantial rise to the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the figures available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, at the District Court, 9600 ads went up because of domestic violence. at 70% of it we went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads were killed by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence at the peace courts. here, 86% of the women were killed.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads said 40% of women, that they were physically misled, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics however do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguan women's Lady Baiardi only few of these crimes are actually shown. "on any woman who are reimbursed in Paraguay due to psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on any woman who are refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "explained them at the end of 2014." ""</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Br√≠tez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name to him all of her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she did not want it, but then after. this should be bered for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos. but two years she endured them the psychological violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable the most severe forms of violence against women and at the same time:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would ever be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read about it earlier, I always thought that only women have happened to be underestimated, because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana useless social media to report on the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and several attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetoric, whether he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook user asked Mariana, why they did so long by Carlos and left him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have a certain degree of complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos that did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they misled them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Network Yo te creo ("I believe you") that are of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case everything started with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner even managed to convince them that it was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against its former partner who developed into an uncovering legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill introduced by the paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorElla (# F√ºrs).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the motion # NiUnaMenos (# non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter, supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original formula of the law considers that Femizid provides an independent criminal offences to explain and tougher to punish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text was changed in some points, in order to also gain the MEPs responsible for decriminalisation of abortions that are currently prohibited in Paraguay, and punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill introduced was planned, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) processing costs that have to bear the victims of violence at the present time, if they just want to have the indication and want to receive a safe place to leave the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law cannot be effective if the legislators does not provide sufficient funds for this purpose:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay that abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">There must be a rethink that violence cannot be seen as something Normal.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or even at all. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research on site. there are two reasons for a lack of healthcare and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences than elsewhere, and lack of investment for exploring these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Bank for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious repercussions in national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, at first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania, he decided to go back home to go back home to support the sambische health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on the misunderstanding of the media about this research.</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambische national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory testing.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Furthermore, I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic testing for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the important current science themes in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no fundamental research. we only set solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>

<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, the health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe us the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience?</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers will change global food production worldwide</seg>
<seg id="2628">This entry of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reported on the solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred already in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outredgeous, the first plant, which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA Astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years Morton's work was achieved only through his own infusion and the question of how many salaters can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of 2000s, he remarked that more and more salads were patented and that he was not able to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only used for individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to illness, a special red or green or curton or curved leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as cereal or carton varieties. due to this trends, plant breeding, environmentalists and experts ensure food safety around the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton is still a salad, however, he generally takes longer because his work is getting more and more limitations always increasing.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it's like being in a river a rock, in order to paddle the pups.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that this patents go far too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before judgment, no one can breed any new salatsorte, because all the features are already patented. so it makes as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and makes every effort to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and throughout the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" -eders).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "Astronauts of the International Space station ISS awarded the red" "" "roredgeous in the" "" "greenhouse" "" "of the station and eaten there. there will be testing whether plants are cultivated in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like it would come out of the IT area rather than from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, providing alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into existence to make sure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and remain permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, in brief Ossi, us, U.S. breeders agree that others may use them freely from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and sell them. "open source" breeders allow only others that you buy seeds, to breed such their own sorts, and not immediately sow them - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patente.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeding and seed companies joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Prospects of prospects for the prospects of life</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed, and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays a role in major centers such as Biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by bred seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "who wants to buy the collapse of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which is offered in August or September 2016." who is offered good, locally and sustainable production, should also know that the way of how this vegetables are bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "nutrition souvenirs without seed power is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the open source Seed initiative are committed to providing others to their seeds, and therefore, as opposed to patent, seeds, and plant characteristics are to be patent.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters arguing that the future of food supplies is compromised, as the available genpool due to the increasingly numerous wered intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always restricted to undispleased.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive, in the Ossi, has engaged in their doctoral work with geneous variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartottenants are protected as intellectual property, which means it is either not usable or useable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts as Luby suggests that massaged plants like wheat in a much more patented style are patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants become so bred that they deliberately have imagined characteristics - from such a way through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in specific environments and threats such as pests or disease.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders are increasing by more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently unnecessary, but ever before, since the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse than predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Sprecherin Carly Scaduto believe that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four covings and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company has advocated the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that spiritual property should foster other breeders" "" "patents and protection of plant varying innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that can be followed every once the patent is expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others with another method to come from the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "thus, such protection has not inhibited innovations, but also promotes it by providing the public more material and know-how." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees that differently: 20 years waiting until a patent lasts, is certainly no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you are waiting for such a long time to grow to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, it would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general public and remain to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what motivates us and it will make us impossible if we can't continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton patches itself on the concept to patent-how," "" "we do not really create the features." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make them out and as breeders have ultimately no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S.-State Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding: "who bred a sorrow, bred his own values in her.</seg>

<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "still the Egyptian authorities are still unlocking content on the internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On weekends around 05.August, the Egyptian government reported the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where it is criticized by the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remain abusive, despite this attack and the prosecution of the Egyptian law and defending human rights in the Arab world, so it was never as difficult as it now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are postponed to overcome the sperm and not to imitate to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored site of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities established more than two months 21 websites, like bspw. the independent news page of the Huffington Post and that from Qatar, network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI also exists on the blog of the columnist and Human Rights, Ahmed Gamal Ziada no access longer in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada has used his blog for the spread of Columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt, not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to handle the tongues-apparatus of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider which is also housed in the organizer's blog, however, is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after spending in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards, while he reported on the student's protraced report, and recorded a video like the police of physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are primarily about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment he voiced Ziada to the interruption by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to block is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blockage of the blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a siege of siege; a detained murder, subcontracted in the National Security Council, the sparity blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I have not in vain. in other words: my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to deal with the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after having blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The muzzle go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Ththought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 web sites. this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet service providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the interruption from vendors, through the circumference of dormitory and Private Surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12 of June we noticed how the blockage of websites, the VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content to the Egyptian users might have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally wasted that the censings made behind closed doors, thus the Egyptian population does not have any legal basis, with which they can proceed to court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question is: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are meeting.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers start in all of Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old in school" "", "" "" "every second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro were murdered," "" "thieves smoked chemist with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army, Navy and Lugenafee to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the violence of violence reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian government-government Global Justice and even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like this have become clear and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the manager of a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The article published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16, "This is not normal" in which it announced, a new column called "war in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All the reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that will happen in any big city in the world such as murder, robbery, etc. whatever happens in Rio, will be published in the category "War in Rio" (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Oct√°vio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, that this decision is not a cause for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war column in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video a journalist of the newspaper stated that according to information provided by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas, which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discreet, if he is distorted, also can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police, that shoots only and then ask questions to cover.</seg>
<seg id="2769">"" "" "" "but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police, its objective is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners." ""</seg>
<seg id="2770">Are the name "war" more than it was useful?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argues the Journalistin Cec√≠lia Oliveira, to call the violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy and could make it difficult to account with the police on account.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military deployments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-sufficiency of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To memory: the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2782">At the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths. for some years, the UPP defect the UPP and repressions against the poor councils which should protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under complaint.</seg>

<seg id="2873">On a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups who had conquered the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Just at that time, Acoaf Barati is a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Europe, for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't work so back then she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning the boy should break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would fetch it and bring him to the smugglers.</seg>

<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal-pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wage, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a strange country along with other refugees and toppies with mortar, the heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2890">"" "" "" "then how today was life of Afghan refugees in Iran characterised by destitution and exploitation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," remembered Acoaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we covered nylon in front of the open windows, so we won't refreshed at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years he left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>

<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Aligent 2002 came to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church that distributed twice a day eating for the needy people.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high availability quotas is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is also true that the conditions, the asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
