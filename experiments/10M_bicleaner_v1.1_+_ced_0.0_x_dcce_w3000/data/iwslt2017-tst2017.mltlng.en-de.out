this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize at the Pul@@ itzer Prize during the New York Times .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular , that N@@ SA was illeg@@ ally heard of Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence cooperation in which the CIA had literally been dra@@ fted an atomic bom@@ b for a nuclear bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter would not be liked ?
the U.S. government .
almost 10 years the government decided against R@@ isen and called it to call him its wor@@ ship@@ ments .
in this train it became a symbol for the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers to condemn and journalists .
according to the First Constitu@@ tional Court , the media have the right to release secret information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the patterns that they are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so when the government came to reven@@ ge , he did something that many bra@@ ve re@@ por@@ ters already did before him , he refused , and said that he would rather go to jail .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , it happened something exceptional .
suddenly , though for years of indications , that it would be vital to their case , the demands of the government were dropped an@@ ew .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters and springs can hide themselves less and less .
rather than to fail and bring down cl@@ ash to the statements , which could also carry out his digital feet for him .
and so the investig@@ ator , without his consent , shall be secre@@ tly geh@@ eim ,
just as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even travel arrangements with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence to judge Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and cr@@ ens alle@@ ged source .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead , the judiciary has no more condem@@ ns than any U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how that a problem may be , especially because the government is too much lon@@ ged from their work as a secret .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press on the play , which is to be protected by the first constitu@@ tion@@ ist , because the government has always more possibilities to express all of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the technology of the government allows to deal with the rights of repression , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they may take advantage of the moment in which they make contact , instead of after@@ ward , in the witness .
today there is communication software , which had not yet existed as a ran@@ ches of his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source exagger@@ ation system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s most famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and has today been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a Message website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information as with any normal contact form .
these are then encryp@@ ted and stored on a server , which only has access to the particular message .
so the government can no longer contain information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world are developing new es@@ pi@@ on@@ isation technologies that meet all of us .
it is to us to ensure that not only technology points like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to squee@@ ze mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers .
who knows about mis@@ states in the supply of soldiers , knows and covered with crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to contamin@@ ated water of Flin@@ t . or a pilgri@@ street insi@@ ders that war@@ ns us ahead of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest dat@@ le@@ ck of history has been released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; will be revealed , &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to a statement . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93; this week we were reported by messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s lawyers .
the publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ ch Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an an@@ onym@@ ity company . can you do it ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister came back .
also there are reports that an Al@@ lies of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad brief@@ ing firms in tax hav@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia president Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait to wait for the next release and the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of a pe@@ writer or John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ Romans .
it seems we@@ pt away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we handle this ?
but the truth is , when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and it affects all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few of them , their assets to hide and to wear it -- something that we have discussed and unveil@@ ed for ten years .
I think many people this whole world seems very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these controllers work .
I imagine it always like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers .
it may be very difficult for prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters is .
I find it interesting too , that in the US there are less reports on this matter .
pres@@ um@@ ably because there has been no prominent Americans who came up in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but through the principle according to which these controllers work , Mos@@ ch Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we would have a dat@@ ap@@ ho@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more inci@@ dents and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is such that you need less information in some U.S. states , less information need to provide a company than to find a libr@@ arian reference .
this kind of in@@ transpar@@ ence in the US has allowed staff of shoulder @-@ circul@@ ates , to rep@@ ay school children .
it has sc@@ ams allowed to gam@@ ble especially low investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t revenues in the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as a African Minister , who wanted to bring money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
sho@@ cking us really that all proposals made up to the lawyer made our inquiries made , how he could transfer his money .
these were all prec@@ ep@@ ts . none of these lawyers took us as a client and of course they were not handed over to anyone else . yet it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as single accidents .
it is not about a single lawyer , who has been subject to our cover@@ t proposals .
it is not about a single prime pol@@ itic , wr@@ apped in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and instability .
and in order to cope with this , we must change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound all very di@@ mm@@ ed as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing ever changed , as if it &apos;s always the rich and powerful ones .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I really see that things have begun to change .
in the last few years we have seen pre@@ aches to more transparency , regarding the owners of companies .
the subject took place political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has captured in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controlled it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have launched a bill of legislative acc@@ us@@ ation in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama &apos;s revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind their proj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need ex@@ ecutives in the economy that arise and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transpar@@ ence is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and stand up with them to end this kind of in@@ consistency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the in@@ security that allows now to end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , at last end .
this is the story of how I can almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the trunk @-@ area of a red Maced@@ oni@@ das would be .
one day after I had finished my design studies , I made a back@@ stead .
a guy got stuck in the red Mazda and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through all the land . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you still having night ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , Man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows the situation not ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I got to know him just now ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to kid@@ n@@ apped in the trunk of an Maced@@ onian !
this is a small c@@ utter@@ ing room !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a li@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ä@@ h , wie please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I rigi@@ d to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh Mann ! what have I built me there ?
a wild@@ ly sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed to shut down to@@ es at the door , and shut my room door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he bought from me is now hanging in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my eyes .
maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as a stran@@ ger , actually friends who only wa@@ ited to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air matt@@ resses , I became normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air matt@@ resses .
let &apos;s start a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my ro@@ omm@@ ate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can manage to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have moved on how we could make something to make . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded so &quot; air conditioning and breakfast &quot; &#91; AIR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests can sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air conditioning in wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we traveled with them through the whole city . as we passed our last guest and the door into the castle fell , star@@ ing Brian and I sat down .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came to the rolling .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors can be closed when you come through .
over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
indeed , they do not .
nobody who is still at sol@@ ace , would invest in a shop that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you get on the things you can eat . we could des@@ ig@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design far more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create trust by design , between people who had never met before .
can design be done so ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a reward , which degree trust we want .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your Com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ locking mobile phone to your left seat .
this quietly approach from panic , you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts sense when they open the door first time .
because the only thing is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ lock mobile phone of a fore@@ igner in your hands ?
the majority feel the responsibility .
so also the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason may our company exist .
only once , who is now Al Go@@ res mobile ?
could you please tell us on Twitter that he t@@ ends to be the President of the President ?
you can give the phones back now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbour would have been presented only once with his name ; if he could have told where he does , how his dog or his children would be called ?
imagine , you would have 150 be@@ ards that all say : &quot; he can say really very well @-@ fle@@ d@@ ked hand ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to sell your mobile phone ?
because a well thought@@ ful feedback system rein@@ forces the confidence crucial .
at the beginning we still did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to surrender negative evalu@@ ations .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both the host and guest made their Be@@ ur@@ ts before we put them online .
last week we have discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are with regard to age and housing .
little surprising we trust the people most that are most happ@@ i@@ est .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
thr@@ illing it is when you add to the reputation of a person -- in our case through ass@@ essm@@ ents .
if you have less than three evalu@@ ations , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation is com@@ mon@@ alities .
so the right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deep @-@ minded preferences .
furthermore , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are inexpensive .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if one tells too little , like for example &apos; Hi ! &apos; , you will find more of an answer .
one tells you how for example : &quot; I have trouble with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le Art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can we create design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the proper design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the great multitude of people who were more than willing to dismant@@ le these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people will take our offer .
you can see three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless effort of our team .
third , a need that had not been covered before .
for us , the business is just very good .
naturally there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who are un@@ authorised parties celebrated or rented apartments .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front , when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it hur@@ ts , if I am just thinking about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our biggest motivation to continue to improve .
fortunately , of the 123 million sold nights only had a fraction , ever a fraction of a problem .
because people trust each other rightly .
when confidence works , there can be mir@@ acles developed .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host was driving him in the hospital .
it even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his jud@@ gement :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to be du@@ red due to se@@ perate activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ector who save lives , even though they do not know well .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they do not want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so naturally not every stay is going on .
but these relations behind the pure money @-@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions work together ?
it is here about an economic trade .
but now it is just a &quot; le@@ ch@@ re industry &quot; to mention , the thing is not just .
share Economy describes a trade , which promises human relationships .
people put a part of himself open and that changes all .
when you travel today is that compared with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but for this less authentic .
what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what would be if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to be a thorough complete and a bar to show a bar in a bar where you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
these days , apartments are designed by the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to shape apartments from reason to collabor@@ ating ?
how would it look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of the common share ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
in South Korean capital , this project was already begun . many parking places that had belonged to the government ,
were offered to residents . students who were looking for a lead ,
were taught to people whose children were exp@@ elled . there have been inc@@ ub@@ ators .
to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy . through our platform alone , tonight 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host .
so the idea does not seem to be crazy as it was brought to us .
we have not inv@@ ented the wheel .
hospitality also gave it before .
of course there were similar websites .
so why did our work work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us to overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that int@@ rigu@@ ing ,
almost overwhelming .
I need to pon@@ der every time , if a red Mazda drives me over .
we obviously know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder where we can take advantage of this soon .
thanks .
what do you think when watching me ?
a belie@@ ver ? a Exper@@ tin ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ ing a brain @-@ la@@ under@@ ing , a terrorist ist ?
or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are neg@@ atively negative .
studies show : the Americans my , most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ owner -- double ro@@ ver es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am both intro@@ ver@@ ted
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a pract@@ itioner , spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I have decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ve me .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to carry out my head@@ gear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friend@@ ships were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lu@@ stige was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely toward the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty .
I have not only believed the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the coral .
I read it , thought , asked , question@@ ed , and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication to deep@@ en up to any reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes takes me more cr@@ ying .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever feeling that somebody you perceive you fully understands , and yet somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I did later , after my marriage , one child , and lived in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had at the end his breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; error message . &quot;
there were R@@ auch , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ill from the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into indi@@ gn@@ ation quickly .
why should we do something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I inter@@ ven@@ ed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u transformed me the actions of another from a civil society into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start studying engineering .
I remember , as I ro@@ de -- as we drove so deeply - so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid of being recognized as a Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then heard , saw and read the war@@ nings of national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so@@ othing in well illumin@@ ated areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assem@@ ble you not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week in@@ doors .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go on the first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the complete reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ wise , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that was held for Muslims , and sm@@ ote them .
there were really industry @-@ suggestions on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I conqu@@ ered the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also fu@@ ri@@ ous .
it is not easy to explain constantly themselves .
I have nothing about questions , I love questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the acc@@ us@@ ations that are hard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nowadays , we can really say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a Tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only under observation .
the alternatives are useless because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , pro@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ cles .
will make the closing of mos@@ ques ?
it will perhaps stop a couple of parking , but not stop the terror .
the regular attendance of a mosque leads to people to regard other faith toler@@ ant , and to show greater citizens &apos; participation .
and like me , a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
when the radic@@ alisation process , one has noticed that it is beginning online . as a conclusion , the person will be cut off from their church , so that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises its behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must adh@@ ere to the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claim@@ ing to be Islam either a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Quran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves into their own world if one reali@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology causes in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , it is not driving them what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence , and said to her anger , her sense of in@@ justice in the world , she would only bring in trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that gave their anger sense , she was a prime goal for the instrument@@ alists with extrem@@ ists who gave her a solution .
he used the connection to God and her church again .
instead of accused them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways to a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she wa@@ ited to join the IS .
this was an insight , such as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how is the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy , to our thought @-@ free speech ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ces .
a study reveals : if one has reported testosterone news where negative about Muslims have been reported , they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ cis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you &apos;re looking for when the mood against Muslims regard up@@ wards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the foreground of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to the Mos@@ lem terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public to infl@@ ate the foundations of a free society , the sensible and well informed citizen .
the deal with Muslims is an early warning .
we might feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear sch@@ a@@ ed us all .
in the assignment of collec@@ ti@@ cul@@ t , it is not only about having to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
he was at the dental clinic , talented , of promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , gener@@ ously humans , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is of my br@@ other@@ one become such an irre@@ ver@@ sive young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Suz@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , they were mur@@ dered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after he posted statements against Muslims on his fac@@ ebook page .
he took eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
we thank it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s office we went silent , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me hold me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am made an announcement , than@@ ked our guests , because half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , A@@ thei@@ sts , belie@@ ver and non @-@ cred@@ itors who had come to attack us , but to join us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you definitely going to be sure ?
or will you join those that mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you &apos;re a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thought of deep@@ est thinking , is an exception rather than the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say it &apos;s not . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual , as it is allowed .
when you look to Muslims around the world and I did it with the greatest ever performed study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want jobs and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem as an exception to rule , then usually the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ler is just before , to become a milli@@ ar@@ c business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutes worldwide .
before air @-@ package order in our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of air@@ planes at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built up a six meter high tower of 1 500 bri@@ cks . some years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting passengers to reach high speed and acceler@@ ation on the stem room .
you can also build self @-@ moving structures .
they have learned to bear the burden to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
thus , a system aut@@ on@@ ome works , it must know collec@@ tively , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the E@@ TH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
we use a new loc@@ alization technology for today &apos;s demo@@ s , a members of our lab@@ s .
there are no external cameras .
every plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine the calculations that should do what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands will be available at the highest level . for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a plane , which tries to hit two loung@@ ers with a fla@@ p .
like other Star@@ r@@ ers it is efficient in the up@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helic@@ op@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ vation it can float , and has therefore great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il like wind bu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the plane no matter in which position the optimal position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved .
okay .
during our research we often act as fundamental abstract issues that penet@@ rate the heart of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of event@@ ful parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that con@@ es you to hurt you .
decades ago , specially trained pilots were allowed remote control units , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ der .
far , we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical sim@@ pl@@ est remote drain . it was inv@@ ented in the short time .
it has only an movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no stap@@ les , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no other actu@@ ators or chec@@ ker @-@ surfaces , just a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical simp@@ y , happens in the inner life very much , so that it can be stable and can move in the room .
yet it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to the loung@@ ers , I have to throw it correctly .
the chance to throw it properly if all watch , is low , so I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in gen@@ etics , this machine is here , the om@@ issions with its eight prop@@ ellers , a practice in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is not symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thus he receives the per@@ al capacity ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is turned or even like it rot@@ ated .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
some of the pictures are adjustable in models , the rest is learned right at the fall .
let &apos;s see ourselves this .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller flags .
this turn in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them , they act like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery , the machine can continue even if limited .
we will now demonstrate that we are able to make half an air@@ field .
the last demonstration of the synthe@@ tic cir@@ cuits .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took the usual micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and permit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the very safe machine there is also wants to end on Broadway a fli@@ eg@@ ant lamp ceiling .
of course it is difficult to pre@@ text the influence of this technology .
for types such as us is the reward in the development and the act of creativity .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form it on so spectacular ways .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galaxy two black holes of each other getting faster , they turned into pure energy in a t@@ enth@@ s in pure energy .
for this short moment they brigh@@ tened them brigh@@ ter than all Stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they don &apos;t put your energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy has been transported to the space @-@ time micro @-@ feet and the universe explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us turn the events into the first time .
1.3 billion years ago was just a multi @-@ shift life on earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rian , men and -- God remain with us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially cour@@ ageous - R@@ ai Weiss reported from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to search a huge laser det@@ ector , in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , resulting in co@@ vit@@ ating black holes .
most they held them crazy .
but enough people realized it as crazy Gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of research , construction , conception and extremely hard hard work they built the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Ob@@ servatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of LI@@ GO could be substantially increased , which improved the recognition power enorm@@ ously improved .
therefore , one calls him Advanced LI@@ GO .
early September 2015 LI@@ GO for a final test run started to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , gra@@ ined the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ ous black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well of my to@@ d@@ ging father .
basically , these were the fruits of my life .
all that , for which I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist am MIT . he studied Gra@@ vit@@ ations@@ waves from black holes and their through ob@@ servat@@ ories like LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ ellen ?
a Gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ utter in the feet of space and time .
while passing the wave , the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction and pl@@ unge into the other .
to illustrate , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses lead to rel@@ ativity often a properly alber@@ tus dance .
&quot; stretch and du@@ cks , stretch and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ ellen extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous .
on 14 September , for example , each one of us was stretched out at the meeting of the waves and broke out . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 N@@ ul@@ len following the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Dar@@ um explained the LI@@ GO @-@ staff for crazy .
with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about the gra@@ v@@ itation
&quot; &quot; &quot; drive Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are abundant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are inv@@ enti@@ onal and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LI@@ GO . Scott maintains , LI@@ GO is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what that means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial extracts , the size of your mobil@@ es .
this is quite practical . for this way you can make an image or a map of things by making it a variety of points coming around you .
with tones it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make an image of things to make you particularly much :
the face of your child approximately .
instead we listen to certain properties like ton@@ ing and height , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , straight Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ b Bob . &quot;
the same applies to Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we can make no simple pictures of objects in the universe .
but by doing some changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least lie for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wav@@ es@@ patterns into all , we can hear the All literally .
the gra@@ v@@ itation too lou@@ der , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , making my colleague Scott has worked very long .
SH : 2 black , not rotating holes , circul@@ ating simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , one does the same p@@ enter with an additional sound change . it sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a sort of movement sequence , penet@@ rate into the wav@@ el@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LI@@ GO Fol@@ ding : &#91; surfing the sound &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows what he must listen to , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun , which is about as fast as the ro@@ ds of your bl@@ ender .
AA : let &apos;s think of what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ cht@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , around a hundred times a second before they col@@ lide .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it , because we heard it .
therein lies the remaining importance of LI@@ GO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; LI@@ GO is a completely new way to explore the Al@@ ls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was never possible before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ ser@@ che stars will explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes do happen in the nucle@@ us , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and si@@ lic@@ on .
we will never pass through , because these op@@ ak are .
Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ kn@@ it : I would like to explore the first minutes of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see it , because the urine is exposed through his own p@@ light .
Gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ ellen should be possible to back up to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , LI@@ GO found right in the first run of things we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : Me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , such as LI@@ GO they watch , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
you are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . black holes are so to say the Sau@@ rier@@ bones for our ar@@ che@@ ological work .
LI@@ GO offers us a completely different point of view to the events in space , to the origin of the stars , and ultimately on how we desc@@ ended from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now consists of being as bra@@ ve as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and p@@ all@@ ets of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servat@@ ories -- a whole new generation of ob@@ servat@@ ories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of which I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , I brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted I to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted I to start playing with the sw@@ ings ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , I feared , conf@@ ated my fear .
my fear , speeches to keep , my social anxiety -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of one word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes that deeply changed my life to an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; kittens , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens , I need milk for my Schn@@ abel@@ t@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me whether I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude in my family . from there I swing to play always with them once you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing exactly , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I would be very happy .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a fl@@ atter@@ ing side effect : only recently , I actually understood that the &apos; yes &apos; col@@ lagen to play with my children my career saved .
I have a real dream job .
I am author@@ ship . I am thinking of things that you aw@@ aken to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I kre@@ ire TV . I scre@@ am television .
I make television , in a great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible to spread 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a television resistance can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days sometimes four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four episodes : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series will run down on Thursday morning .
all over the world , my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts , which I created myself , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really st@@ ile , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and to tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who still makes it ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to impress you for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re talking about a company , a country or a classroom , to take a business or a household , so you understand that I am not only on the computer st@@ em@@ ger and imagin@@ ative , and it is true when I say : I understand that it does not work with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set troops on , as I painted on a canvas .
so as cap@@ ri@@ fe you have a high sound , ran a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , cru@@ de and rational , cru@@ el and rational , and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s h@@ ears itself like a busy road , I could forever go on her .
many people take note , if I &apos;m writing them the sum@@ s that I persu@@ ade writing to writing my writing .
do not understand me wrong , this does it .
but the sum@@ s began when I began working with the TV production , when I began to work and work , build and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s of God is the voice of my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot be different from the size .
the feeling , not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it means genius .
perhaps it says ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make a clear one : the more you become more , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things simultaneously , the more watch me , the more I &apos;m writing history , all the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the country , which I sh@@ attered , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then it stops the bu@@ zz .
revised , over@@ exposed , exagger@@ ated , extended .
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that her mother is a single working copy .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens , I want to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of an Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , as the sum@@ s stopped .
the sum@@ s of the engine st@@ rolling .
I didn &apos;t loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , passed away weekends , not rep@@ ent@@ ance , none of deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps , doesn &apos;t exist on , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was .
so what do you do , if what you do , the job you love , suddenly allowed ?
I know , some may think : &quot; Mo@@ l you out , bl@@ unt the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know you do it , you do what you do , one wants to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates to be , one painter , Bill Gates knows , and knows how the sum@@ s feels when you knew the sum@@ s before , when the sum@@ s stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart listen , I can survive in the silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress is &quot; a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way back to the outside , but she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more than two things to be aware of :
first , I need to say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; kit@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not calling any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happened ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan bin and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and run their sisters , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ever@@ lasting podium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my sor@@ row and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and lack of money , I can do nothing but fit .
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed .
I am silent .
the country , which I sh@@ attered , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are stick@@ y fingers and moisture nuts , delicate voices , w@@ ax@@ ed and the song in which it is going to let go , or whatever the girl in &apos; The ic@@ Queen of &apos; release .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me is solved .
a mental door goes on and an energy sur@@ ge comes in .
and this not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working sum@@ s , the Tit@@ an@@ pl@@ aster , which is only the substitute .
if I ask who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself through ship@@ ments and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is not a force and it is not working out of work .
it depends on the joy .
the true sum@@ s is dependent on love .
the sum@@ s is the stream that comes from life .
real sum@@ s is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of the story that were ligh@@ tened tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
true sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe it whis@@ pered with God the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a Titan bin ?
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me I will say yes .
I make this a firm rule , so I can free myself as work@@ a@@ holic of any gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I do not have any other choice . I do not have any other choice , as far as I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play doesn &apos;t suits me as well as work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ,
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I &apos;m still working , because I love it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am rather on the workplace as home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of person is working better than being home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am honest , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we slept in the garden , before and back , and forth .
we make little dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst Sei@@ f@@ enb@@ las@@ en .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always ri@@ pe after my mobile phone .
yet it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fulfilled me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever heard about playing ?
you can also ! tell them always Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
there you probably have quite , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they have been easier to make something different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ äfer or K@@ eks .
and speak my teenage daughter , all 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more you do not need .
each can bring 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad @-@ mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the kids have finished .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
my children are my kindness , my world . there must not be the children . it &apos;s true to feel the sum@@ s of having a place for his soul @-@ fri@@ day .
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it yourself .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I vic@@ tories . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for everything I was given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a bit , why not have a full 15 minutes drive ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to come back if I am not working .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself back in my office . I hear a UFO mel@@ ody , she fills me and my soul . I re@@ lie@@ ve me to new ideas . I take advantage of it again . I use it to the full time and I love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I do not love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
so@@ f@@ enb@@ las@@ en and stick@@ y finger , dinners with friends .
this is now my sum@@ s .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of Love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and therefore I am so grateful .
it is me crazy that I am a Titan bin . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land which I sh@@ ew , the marathon , the can@@ v@@ ases , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new way of living in me wide . less Titan -- more !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author@@ ship . I think things that I aw@@ aken you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dre@@ am@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am a neurolog@@ y surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke , or after an accident .
for us neurolog@@ ist it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy handic@@ ap .
that is probably the reason why I have been working neurolog@@ y surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve @-@ functions through various surgical measures .
they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known one of the &quot; free@@ zing stimulation &quot; . thereby , you im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep inside the brain to influence the circuit circles of the neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function has improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , which suffered under severe tre@@ mor and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of working neurolog@@ y is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was conduc@@ tors and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I cat@@ ered patients with skull @-@ stag @-@ trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain , and the skull @-@ pressure rises .
to save life , you have to l@@ essen the skull @-@ pressure .
for this one has sometimes to remove a part s@@ wollen brain wheel .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain wheel , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , to analyse the brain .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
let cells grow from a tissue , is comparable to all small children that are removed from your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts there are Jean @-@ François .
he saw he under his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , mature cells .
perhaps you will still know from the bi@@ ology lessons , that stem cells un@@ mature cells are , that can turn into any cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . you are hidden in deep , small niche of brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain growth in the operation .
we did a further fascinating observation : normal tri@@ bal cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells kept differently .
they slowly spread out and after a couple of weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked different .
we needed long to understand where they came .
these cells come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called dou@@ ble@@ eding in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you can make 4 % of our grand@@ son .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the fol@@ d@@ ment of the brain .
but why are they left us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain injury .
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell spring , the brain division .
this had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain @-@ mass from the non @-@ language area , and then the cells can cultiv@@ ate exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and then mark them in colorful , in order to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ im@@ planted them at the correspon@@ d@@ ulous of the same individual .
we call the autonomous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ plant the same cells in wast@@ ed brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not use it , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted precisely the same cells and now the cells have been preserved -- they washed away to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence to show them are these small points . these are the cells that we are in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain @-@ injury ?
so we pract@@ ising monkeys with a manual skills .
they had to take p@@ ellets of a tray .
they did so well .
when they had achieved a stable skill level , we spent in motor@@ ic Cort@@ ex the hand@@ mot@@ ori@@ k area .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to people , they spontane@@ ously , up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural bra@@ in@@ cis@@ ms . they are able to a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous rest , im@@ planted we his own cells .
on the left side they see the monkeys that rec@@ alled spontane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
as we see the cells re@@ im@@ planted , the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze it and then use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for instance with Park@@ inson .
however , our dream is still to im@@ plant them with people .
I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , which is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you start clinical trials at the human being .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill about two k@@ ilo@@ grams of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
JB : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : have a look at the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to see the future , how many years it takes to get to hospital and this therapy will be available .
JB : this is difficult to say .
initially it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
one must first truly prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . JB : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality but as invent@@ aris of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing conditions .
we believe capitalism necessarily leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great night @-@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have shown beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , the democracy comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not influence the austerity programmes that were realised in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there might be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who would have repeated to me that democracy would change .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ective democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are mur@@ dered , our future is dark and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of waste , I would like to point you out of an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies .
I call it the &quot; T@@ ill@@ ings@@ gi@@ ver @-@ Parad@@ ox &quot; .
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but few recognize his tw@@ illing .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the spo@@ iling as@@ parag@@ us and corporations , but they are too anxi@@ ous to bring it there where it would be productive and income , by which one could produce the Schul@@ den@@ berg and also produce all the things we urgently needed , for example &apos; green &apos; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro zone have put together 3.4 tr@@ illion dollars , such as industrial installations , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , dr@@ y@@ ise , equipment , and so on and so forth .
3.4 tr@@ illion US dollars does sound like a lot of money , until you compare it with the $ 5,@@ 1 tr@@ illion US dollars , which at the same time hing@@ es in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except to ex@@ pose the stock prices and the real property prices .
so debts and un@@ productive capital form the tw@@ ins of tw@@ ins , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 year old in the US , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest in . just like O@@ edi@@ pus father , who could not invest in such a final demand that the proph@@ es@@ y of the rac@@ use could be true that his son would kill him if he grows ,
un@@ bi@@ ol@@ ate the circumstances bring about it that o@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my ha@@ i@@ ble with capitalism --
its exce@@ ed@@ itable Art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and particularly financing all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the corporate form , in which the Free and the poor control the poor as a majority of the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed off course too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake that can mit@@ ig@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ean democracy due to these di@@ closures .
the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she &apos;s the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important , and more decisive , they gave them the right to political co@@ determination with equal vo@@ icing questions .
indeed , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept for a long time --
as a cand@@ le that lights very bright , it is also quickly extended .
but today our today &apos;s liberal democr@@ acies does not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately had a stat@@ ute for ruling class .
for the liberal democracy was only possible , as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was imposed upon politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democr@@ ati@@ cism zone was established .
in our current democr@@ acies , the separation of politics and business began , in which this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , and the economy gradually emig@@ rated to politics .
are wondering why the politicians are no longer so than before ?
there is no de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because you can be in the government today and still do not believe in power , because the power of politics is depos@@ ited in the economy and those areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ p with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about as a herd of prey , which so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ating that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has become so bro@@ adly defined by the self @-@ causing economic crisis themselves . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated , the inequality rises , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their company .
the more successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; s@@ ells out of democracy , the greater the tw@@ ins of human labour and the greater the waste of human labor force and prosperity of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back again , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserves the control so as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is by the way not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t surprising .
the teaching of the de@@ acon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : the working poor can do !
capitalism does it by placing low @-@ wage ear@@ ners by automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of tw@@ ins will be higher , the wast@@ age and social conflicts deeper , as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we need to re@@ construct the economy and re @-@ unite the areas of business and politics , and thereby take care of the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question therefore is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements which he has brought forth , survive .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved through a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; or similar to the human society in &quot; Star Trek &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be , how could it look , this &quot; star Trek &quot; -@@ like u@@ topia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I want to tell you , soon , some examples name .
in the field of enterprises : ask yourself a capital market , where you earn money , while you work and in which your capital follows you from a work place to next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you currently work -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then deri@@ ving all the income from capital and out of rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , who do not work in it , and employees who work there where the company is not owned . no exchange rate between capital and labour , no major g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ar , and ultimately no up@@ rag@@ ing tw@@ ins .
in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of the entire humanity .
imagine that the entire world trading in this currency will be trad@@ ed -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the merch@@ ant of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund will be invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where capital expenditure are r@@ ar .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time the technical means had not been implemented .
today we have them , especially in the background of a united politics and economy .
the world I describe you is simultaneously liber@@ ally , in which they pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ word , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ on .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ed ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you decide in your biography itself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I &apos;ve just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ union of politics and economy is ... Do not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in economic demand , which is Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a long term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only matter our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfectly integrated .
BG : indeed , and now we are at ease too .
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ ing , you don &apos;t think about .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have told very clearly what you consider from the view of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies , we have a sem@@ blan@@ ce of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of them plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely democracy zone .
in certain respects , if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles China of the 19th century .
for -- you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ ale , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical for the democratic development .
what you can watch in China now , resem@@ bles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now advoc@@ ates what the West has done itself in the 19th century , smells of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that lots of list@@ eners are curious to your experience as a Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sens@@ ed that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how can you look back on the first half months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to get a new beginning with the eurozone .
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely us to adopt the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the perpet@@ ual den@@ ying that a massive ret@@ ou@@ fl@@ ation line ran through the eurozone and continues to be thre@@ aten the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was to reveal this denial --
it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the Europ@@ group , continue to choose the denial .
but you know what comes .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one is trying to get a economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay a while , but if the shift occurs , he happens off ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
if there is a finance minister , or some Minister there , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims , he made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the school program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government only because they did not want to deal with the publishers who have expired by the Eurozone .
they did not want to conc@@ ede that she has been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we have lost a third of our nomin@@ ale GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika and don@@ ors imposed by us have raised this policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ aler mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive notes of the conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for when she does not survive , the will be released , will be released , and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic only for Europe but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to beat the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 &apos;s way , for which it seems to me , it will be as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong with this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for spending at TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy price , most of them have never heard , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate @-@ minute sessions of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to decision I met there three years ago .
Roy Price is conduc@@ tors at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ Production Company of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for bringing the shows and content to the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard cont@@ est@@ ed industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can not select any other .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are at the right side of this corner .
this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the review is between 1 and 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will be maintained .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows as &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , ad@@ dic@@ tive where , after having seen a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at the end , are shows like &quot; Tod@@ d@@ ler and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough , what is going on at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not care to get on the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence to submit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes themselves more thought about the average payout , the average television , the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight .
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon does something , therefore doesn &apos;t want to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode each of these shows and puts them online , where they can watch each free of charge .
and if Amazon there are other things out there , you are still att@@ acking yourself right ?
millions of spect@@ ators look at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed during the watch of these shows .
they are seen by Roy and his team who take up everything .
you record when you start the show when you p@@ opped up , which parts you ski@@ ps or look at once .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data which Show them should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process this and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can American sen@@ ators . &quot;
you made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems that not many things can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is only one average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.@@ 4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det made at 7.5 -- therefore something above average but not exactly what is on Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is he always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team have watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc .
then they make use of these data to find these little details on the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a mu@@ st@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x so has a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
it has two very competent , data se@@ ated companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with all .
when you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years on statistics as a back @-@ up .
you are optimized by very powerful computers .
the Min@@ de@@ ste , which can you expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis so does not work , this is something fri@@ ghtening because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does someone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one can ever get in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if any one is in the U.S. in prison and for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is done or not .
exactly as on Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate on television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite of the many data ,
not always the best results are created . this is not because a company such as multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the dates of se@@ ven@@ ed companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can pre@@ di@@ ct by data analysis of flu , the worst kind , predic@@ tions -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it func@@ tioned properly , year round year , until it suddenly had no more functional ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data is se@@ ven@@ ed firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all this faul@@ ts , data changes in decisions of life -- in the workplace , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should prefer to make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gen@@ etics -- a territory where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have known some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and non @-@ successful decisions .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
at first , you place this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the parts ; as a wide , you put the individual parts back together to take a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things to fall apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to take a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to compos@@ e the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to compos@@ e again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to put a good discharge -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they used data and mind , where they can also go in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they otherwise would not have been able to . but the decision on how to take all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they did a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all of their decisions , first as they who compet@@ ed by TV @-@ ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as the show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the data we say &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is only a tool , and in order to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball , &quot; it is amazing . for decisions made using a Ja@@ or No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , -- just here at this moment .
I will be able to f@@ ade it later with a Techni@@ k@@ demo .
so far I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by something much more washed , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic construction .
so perhaps the ball will cl@@ ing and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it is up to us to make decisions , if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data is still paying off , decisions to make , an expert in what you are doing , and risks involved .
because in the end it is not the data but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve .
thanks beautiful .
