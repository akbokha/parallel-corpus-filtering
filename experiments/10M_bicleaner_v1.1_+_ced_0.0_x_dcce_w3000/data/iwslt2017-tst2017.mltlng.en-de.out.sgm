<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize at the Pulitzer Prize during the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular, that NSA was illegally heard of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence cooperation in which the CIA had literally been drafted an atomic bomb for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter would not be liked?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Almost 10 years the government decided against Risen and called it to call him its worshipments.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train it became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to release secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the patterns that they are not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government came to revenge, he did something that many brave reporters already did before him, he refused, and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, it happened something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though for years of indications, that it would be vital to their case, the demands of the government were dropped anew.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring the reporters and springs can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to fail and bring down clash to the statements, which could also carry out his digital feet for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigator, without his consent, shall be secretly geheim,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even travel arrangements with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crens alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has no more condemns than any U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that a problem may be, especially because the government is too much longed from their work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblowers to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press on the play, which is to be protected by the first constitutionist, because the government has always more possibilities to express all of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government allows to deal with the rights of repression, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they may take advantage of the moment in which they make contact, instead of afterward, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software, which had not yet existed as a ranches of his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source exaggeration system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet's most famous Aaron Swartz, and has today been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a Message website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information as with any normal contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the particular message.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer contain information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world are developing new espionisation technologies that meet all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to us to ensure that not only technology points like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to squeeze misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers.</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about misstates in the supply of soldiers, knows and covered with crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to contaminated water of Flint. or a pilgristreet insiders that warns us ahead of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest datleck of history has been released.] [the "Panama Papers" will be revealed, [what does this mean?] [we baten Robert Palmer of Global Witness to a statement.] [what does this mean?] [we baten Robert Palmer of Global Witness to an explanation.] this week we were reported by messages about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosch Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymity company. can you do it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister came back.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that an Allies of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad briefing firms in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia president Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait to wait for the next release and the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of a pewriter or John-Grisham-Romans.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems wept away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we handle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And it affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few of them, their assets to hide and to wear it -- something that we have discussed and unveiled for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these controllers work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I imagine it always like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting too, that in the US there are less reports on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there has been no prominent Americans who came up in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle according to which these controllers work, Mosch Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we would have a dataphock from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more incidents and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is such that you need less information in some U.S. states, less information need to provide a company than to find a librarian reference.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparence in the US has allowed staff of shoulder-circulates, to repay school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has scams allowed to gamble especially low investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert revenues in the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as a African Minister, who wanted to bring money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">Shocking us really that all proposals made up to the lawyer made our inquiries made, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all precepts. none of these lawyers took us as a client and of course they were not handed over to anyone else. yet it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single accidents.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who has been subject to our covert proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single prime politic, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound all very dimmed as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing ever changed, as if it's always the rich and powerful ones.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I really see that things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen preaches to more transparency, regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took place political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has captured in central registers at the national level, who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controlled it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have launched a bill of legislative accusation in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind their projections.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that arise and say:" "" "Intransparence is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and stand up with them to end this kind of inconsistency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the insecurity that allows now to end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, at last end.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I can almost kidnapped and in the trunk-area of a red Macedonidas would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had finished my design studies, I made a backstead.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy got stuck in the red Mazda and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through all the land. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where are you still having night?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse, "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, Man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I got to know him just now! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to kidnapped in the trunk of an Macedonian!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small cuttering room!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a limatratze. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said," "" "äh, wie please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I rigid to the ceiling and thought: "Oh Mann! what have I built me there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildly sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed to shut down toes at the door, and shut my room door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he bought from me is now hanging in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, actually friends who only waited to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattresses, I became normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's start a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can manage to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have moved on how we could make something to make. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded so "air conditioning and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests can sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air conditioning in wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-Omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We traveled with them through the whole city. as we passed our last guest and the door into the castle fell, staring Brian and I sat down.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented our Investors: "we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors can be closed when you come through.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed, they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still at solace, would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you get on the things you can eat. we could desigate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design far more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create trust by design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be done so?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a reward, which degree trust we want.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your Comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocking mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly approach from panic, you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts sense when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlock mobile phone of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">The majority feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason may our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once, who is now Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us on Twitter that he tends to be the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can give the phones back now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour would have been presented only once with his name; if he could have told where he does, how his dog or his children would be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 beards that all say: "he can say really very well-fledked hand!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to sell your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thoughtful feedback system reinforces the confidence crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we still did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to surrender negative evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both the host and guest made their Beurts before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are with regard to age and housing.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most that are most happiest.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thrilling it is when you add to the reputation of a person -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deep-minded preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells too little, like for example 'Hi!', you will find more of an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">One tells you how for example: "I have trouble with my mother" -- -- the request is rather not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle Artworks in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the proper design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great multitude of people who were more than willing to dismantle these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people will take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless effort of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Naturally there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are unauthorised parties celebrated or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it hurts, if I am just thinking about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers, and will always be our biggest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million sold nights only had a fraction, ever a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, there can be miracles developed.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was driving him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">It even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to be dured due to seperate activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protector who save lives, even though they do not know well.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait, while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they do not want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So naturally not every stay is going on.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money-action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions work together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But now it is just a "lechre industry" to mention, the thing is not just.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of himself open and that changes all.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today is that compared with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but for this less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be if at any place you visited, a group there would wait to be a thorough complete and a bar to show a bar in a bar where you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">These days, apartments are designed by the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments from reason to collaborating?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would it look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital, this project was already begun. many parking places that had belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered to residents. students who were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were expelled. there have been incubators.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in Share Economy. through our platform alone, tonight 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">Of course there were similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that intriguing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I need to ponder every time, if a red Mazda drives me over.</seg>
<seg id="253">We obviously know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder where we can take advantage of this soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when watching me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a Expertin?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, undering a brain-laundering, a terrorist ist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negatively negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans my, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-owner -- double rover espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am both introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practitioner, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to ouve me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as the Muslim. I decided to carry out my headgear.</seg>

<seg id="278">The Lustige was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely toward the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed the faith of my parents.</seg>

<seg id="303">I remember, as I rode -- as we drove so deeply - so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid of being recognized as a Muslim.</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a Tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are useless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, prosthelfer and Olympionicles.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will make the closing of mosques?</seg>
<seg id="331">It will perhaps stop a couple of parking, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular attendance of a mosque leads to people to regard other faith tolerant, and to show greater citizens' participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And like me, a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When the radicalisation process, one has noticed that it is beginning online. as a conclusion, the person will be cut off from their church, so that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who despises its behavior and their ideology is a traitor or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must adhere to the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming to be Islam either a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves into their own world if one realizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology causes in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if one throws a look at it, it is not driving them what they read in their" Holy Scripture. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence, and said to her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, she would only bring in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that gave their anger sense, she was a prime goal for the instrumentalists with extremists who gave her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">He used the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accused them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways to a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she waited to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, such as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How is the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy, to our thought-free speech?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals: if one has reported testosterone news where negative about Muslims have been reported, they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you're looking for when the mood against Muslims regard upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the foreground of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to the Moslem terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to inflate the foundations of a free society, the sensible and well informed citizen.</seg>
<seg id="366">The deal with Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear schaed us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collecticult, it is not only about having to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generously humans, whom she knew.</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We thank it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's office we went silent, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me hold me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked our guests, because half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believer and non-creditors who had come to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for Bastler is just before, to become a milliarc business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutes worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-package order in our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of airplanes at the Frac Centre in France has built up a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting passengers to reach high speed and acceleration on the stem room.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-moving structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear the burden to deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">Thus, a system autonome works, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">We use a new localization technology for today's demos, a members of our labs.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine the calculations that should do what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands will be available at the highest level. for example." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane, which tries to hit two loungers with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrers it is efficient in the upward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starvation it can float, and has therefore great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turmoil like wind busts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the plane no matter in which position the optimal position can be regained and the performance can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often act as fundamental abstract issues that penetrate the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of eventful parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that cones you to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, specially trained pilots were allowed remote control units, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Far, we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanical simplest remote drain. it was invented in the short time.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only an movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No staples, hinges and Querruder, no other actuators or checker-surfaces, just a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical simpy, happens in the inner life very much, so that it can be stable and can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Yet it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to bring it to the loungers, I have to throw it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The chance to throw it properly if all watch, is low, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospinner is an exercise in genetics, this machine is here, the omissions with its eight propellers, a practice in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is not symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the peral capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is turned or even like it rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some of the pictures are adjustable in models, the rest is learned right at the fall.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see ourselves this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller flags.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turn in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they act like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery, the machine can continue even if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we are able to make half an airfield.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration of the synthetic circuits.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and permit them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The very safe machine there is also wants to end on Broadway a fliegant lamp ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to pretext the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us is the reward in the development and the act of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form it on so spectacular ways.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxy two black holes of each other getting faster, they turned into pure energy in a tenths in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they brightened them brighter than all Stars together in all galaxies of the entire known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they don't put your energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy has been transported to the space-time micro-feet and the universe exploded in Gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us turn the events into the first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago was just a multi-shift life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurian, men and -- God remain with us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous - Rai Weiss reported from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to search a huge laser detector, in order to search for gravitational-waves, resulting in covitating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized it as crazy Genies, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of research, construction, conception and extremely hard hard work they built the detector LIGO: the Laser-Interferometer- Gravitational-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could be substantially increased, which improved the recognition power enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, one calls him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">Early September 2015 LIGO for a final test run started to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, grained the gravitational-waves of the two collidious black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my todging father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that, for which I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist am MIT. he studied Gravitationswaves from black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. what are Gravitational wellen?</seg>
<seg id="493">A Gravitational wave is a cutter in the feet of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">While passing the wave, the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction and plunge into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers in courses lead to relativity often a properly albertus dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and ducks, stretch and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that Gravitational wellen extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each one of us was stretched out at the meeting of the waves and broke out. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 Nullen following the comma, followed by a 1. Darum explained the LIGO-staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometres long laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about the gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "drive Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, hunting for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are abundant." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventional and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott maintains, LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial extracts, the size of your mobiles.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for this way you can make an image or a map of things by making it a variety of points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make an image of things to make you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like toning and height, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now, straight Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dumb Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to Gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we can make no simple pictures of objects in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by doing some changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wavespatterns into all, we can hear the All literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation too louder, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, making my colleague Scott has worked very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: 2 black, not rotating holes, circulating simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, one does the same penter with an additional sound change. it sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of movement sequence, penetrate into the wavelform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO Folding: [surfing the sound] Jemand, who knows what he must listen to, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun, which is about as fast as the rods of your blender.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think of what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dichtest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, around a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it, because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"" "" "" "LIGO is a completely new way to explore the Alls" "", "as it was never possible before." ""</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserche stars will explode in super-novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes do happen in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through, because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the Urknit: I would like to explore the first minutes of the Alls, but we will never see it, because the urine is exposed through his own plight.</seg>
<seg id="541">Gravitational wellen should be possible to back up to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen which we have never seen and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found right in the first run of things we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: Me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, such as LIGO they watch, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">You are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. black holes are so to say the Saurierbones for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO offers us a completely different point of view to the events in space, to the origin of the stars, and ultimately on how we descended from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of being as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and pallets of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say to everything" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of which I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, I brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted I to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted I to start playing with the swings?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, I feared, confated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep, my social anxiety -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of one word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that deeply changed my life to an unexpected kind. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all "kittens,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my Schnabeltasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked me whether I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude in my family. from there I swing to play always with them once you ask me. no matter what I'm doing exactly, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I would be very happy.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a flattering side effect: only recently, I actually understood that the 'yes' collagen to play with my children my career saved.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am authorship. I am thinking of things that you awaken to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I kreire TV. I scream television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible to spread 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are at the same time in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television resistance can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days sometimes four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four episodes: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series will run down on Thursday morning.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts, which I created myself, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really stile, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and to tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you for this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it, because I know what you think, when the word" "" "author" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you're talking about a company, a country or a classroom, to take a business or a household, so you understand that I am not only on the computer stemger and imaginative, and it is true when I say: I understand that it does not work with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set troops on, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as caprife you have a high sound, ran a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, crude and rational, cruel and rational, and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums hears itself like a busy road, I could forever go on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take note, if I'm writing them the sums that I persuade writing to writing my writing.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, this does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums began when I began working with the TV production, when I began to work and work, build and working together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God is the voice of my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you cannot be different from the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it means genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it says ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear one: the more you become more, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things simultaneously, the more watch me, the more I'm writing history, all the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I shattered, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overexposed, exaggerated, extended.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single working copy.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of an Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, as the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine strolling.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, passed away weekends, not repentance, none of delegating, a Titan sleeps, doesn't exist on, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do, if what you do, the job you love, suddenly allowed?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think: "Mol you out, blunt the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do what you do, one wants to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates to be, one painter, Bill Gates knows, and knows how the sums feels when you knew the sums before, when the sums stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart listen, I can survive in the silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states" waitress is "a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way back to the outside, but she says:" "" "Mama, Do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no more than two things to be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I need to say yes to everything and secondly, they called me not "kitties."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "it is not calling any more" "" "kittens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan bin and my sums, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says:" "" "Mama, Do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and run their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book" "" "everlasting podium." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my sorrow and my panic, in loneliness and lack of money, I can do nothing but fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I shattered, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moisture nuts, delicate voices, waxed and the song in which it is going to let go, or whatever the girl in 'The icQueen of' release.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is solved.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy surge comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And this not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working sums, the Titanplaster, which is only the substitute.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself through shipments and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not a force and it is not working out of work.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The true sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the stream that comes from life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of the story that were lightened tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">True sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but maybe it whispered with God the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am a Titan bin?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a firm rule, so I can free myself as workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I do not have any other choice. I do not have any other choice, as far as I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play doesn't suits me as well as work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I'm still working, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">"" "" "" "I am rather on the workplace as home." ""</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what kind of person is working better than being home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>

<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We slept in the garden, before and back, and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make little dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst Seifenblasen.</seg>

<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we ever heard about playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! tell them always Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you probably have quite, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to come back if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself back in my office. I hear a UFO melody, she fills me and my soul. I relieve me to new ideas. I take advantage of it again. I use it to the full time and I love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I do not love it.</seg>

<seg id="796">I am a neurology surgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke, or after an accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurologist it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy handicap.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I have been working neurology surgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve-functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have heard of one of the most well-known one of the "freezing stimulation". thereby, you implanted a electrode deep inside the brain to influence the circuit circles of the neurons so that the neurological function has improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which suffered under severe tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of working neurology is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conductors and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I catered patients with skull-stag-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at Schädel-Hirn-traumata the brain, and the skull-pressure rises.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to lessen the skull-pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this one has sometimes to remove a part swollen brain wheel.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain wheel, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, to analyse the brain.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Let cells grow from a tissue, is comparable to all small children that are removed from your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts there are Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw he under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, mature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you will still know from the biology lessons, that stem cells unmature cells are, that can turn into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. you are hidden in deep, small niche of brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain growth in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did a further fascinating observation: normal tribal cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells kept differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread out and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">These cells come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called doubleeding in-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You can make 4% of our grandson.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they ensure the foldment of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they left us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell spring, the brain division.</seg>
<seg id="850">This had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain-mass from the non-language area, and then the cells can cultivate exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in colorful, in order to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimplanted them at the correspondulous of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autonomous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplant the same cells in wasted brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not use it, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimplanted precisely the same cells and now the cells have been preserved -- they washed away to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence to show them are these small points. these are the cells that we are in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain-injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we practising monkeys with a manual skills.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did so well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable skill level, we spent in motoric Cortex the handmotorik area.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously, up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of sculptural braincisms. they are able to a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous rest, implanted we his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys that recalled spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original power from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">As we see the cells reimplanted, the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and then use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for instance with Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">However, our dream is still to implant them with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you start clinical trials at the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: have a look at the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to see the future, how many years it takes to get to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first truly prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality but as inventaris of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging conditions.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism necessarily leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great night-ahmer in Beijing have shown beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, the democracy comes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not influence the austerity programmes that were realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who would have repeated to me that democracy would change.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truthful and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are murdered, our future is dark and our great, new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point you out of an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Tillingsgiver-Paradox".</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the Schuldenberg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twilling.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the spoiling asparagus and corporations, but they are too anxious to bring it there where it would be productive and income, by which one could produce the Schuldenberg and also produce all the things we urgently needed, for example 'green' energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the euro zone have put together 3.4 trillion dollars, such as industrial installations, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, dryise, equipment, and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars does sound like a lot of money, until you compare it with the $5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time hinges in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except to expose the stock prices and the real property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So debts and unproductive capital form the twins of twins, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 year old in the US, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest in. just like Oedipus father, who could not invest in such a final demand that the prophesy of the racuse could be true that his son would kill him if he grows,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unbiolate the circumstances bring about it that oedipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haible with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its exceeditable Art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and particularly financing all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form, in which the Free and the poor control the poor as a majority of the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed off course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake that can mitigate the significance of the athenean democracy due to these diclosures.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that she's the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important, and more decisive, they gave them the right to political codetermination with equal voicing questions.</seg>
<seg id="935">Indeed, the Athenian democracy has not kept for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">As a candle that lights very bright, it is also quickly extended.</seg>
<seg id="937">But today our today's liberal democracies does not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately had a statute for ruling class.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy was only possible, as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was imposed upon politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democraticism zone was established.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, the separation of politics and business began, in which this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, and the economy gradually emigrated to politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are wondering why the politicians are no longer so than before?</seg>
<seg id="943">There is no degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you can be in the government today and still do not believe in power, because the power of politics is deposited in the economy and those areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hap with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about as a herd of prey, which so sustainably the animals, of which they are nourished, decimating that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has become so broadly defined by the self-causing economic crisis themselves. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devaluated, the inequality rises, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their company.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism the "Demos" [the people] sells out of democracy, the greater the twins of human labour and the greater the waste of human labor force and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back again, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "reserves the control so as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is by the way not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't surprising.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching of the deacon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor can do!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by placing low-wage earners by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of twins will be higher, the wastage and social conflicts deeper, as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "therefore, we need to reconstruct the economy and re-unite the areas of business and politics, and thereby take care of the reunified area, otherwise we end the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question therefore is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements which he has brought forth, survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved through a Dystopia, similar to the "matrix" or similar to the human society in "Star Trek" or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be, how could it look, this "star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I want to tell you, soon, some examples name.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of enterprises: ask yourself a capital market, where you earn money, while you work and in which your capital follows you from a work place to next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you currently work -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then deriving all the income from capital and out of redeeming and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, who do not work in it, and employees who work there where the company is not owned. no exchange rate between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and spar, and ultimately no upraging twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of the entire humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trading in this currency will be traded -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund will be invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where capital expenditure are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time the technical means had not been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in the background of a united politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe you is simultaneously liberally, in which they prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keyword, global keynesion.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystoped?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You decide in your biography itself as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I've just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunion of politics and economy is... Do not do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in economic demand, which is Larry Summers as a long term stagnation. "</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "by transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only matter our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfectly integrated.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are at ease too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wiring, you don't think about.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have told very clearly what you consider from the view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of them plays, -- the area of economy -- a completely democracy zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain respects, if I can say that provocative, China today resembles China of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberale, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical for the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can watch in China now, resembles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now advocates what the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that lots of listeners are curious to your experience as a Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How can you look back on the first half months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to get a new beginning with the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely us to adopt the complacency and the perpetual denying that a massive retouflation line ran through the eurozone and continues to be threaten the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Europgroup, continue to choose the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one is trying to get a economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay a while, but if the shift occurs, he happens off abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or some Minister there, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims, he made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the school program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the sides of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government only because they did not want to deal with the publishers who have expired by the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that she has been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We have lost a third of our nominale GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika and donors imposed by us have raised this policy:" "" "this was a colossaler mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive notes of the conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolute.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "" "" "for when she does not survive, the will be released, will be released, and destroy the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be catastrophic only for Europe but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to beat the way of a post-modern 1930's way, for which it seems to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong with this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for spending at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy price, most of them have never heard, although it is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate-minute sessions of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to decision I met there three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conductors at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-Production Company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for bringing the shows and content to the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard contested industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not select any other.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are at the right side of this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the review is between 1 and 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows as "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows, addictive where, after having seen a season, your brain asks, "Where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at the end, are shows like "Toddler and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you enough, what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not care to get on the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence to submit" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes themselves more thought about the average payout, the average television, the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply don't delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon does something, therefore doesn't want to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode each of these shows and puts them online, where they can watch each free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon there are other things out there, you are still attacking yourself right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed during the watch of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are seen by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you popped up, which parts you skips or look at once.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data which Show them should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process this and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican American senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "" "" "yes," "" "Alpha House," "" "but it seems that not many things can remember this show because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">There is only one average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House landet made at 7.5 -- therefore something above average but not exactly what is on Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming design of Netflix. just like Roy is he always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team have watched the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they make use of these data to find these little details on the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a mustator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix so has a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competent, data seated companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years on statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The Mindeste, which can you expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis so does not work, this is something frightening because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one can ever get in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If any one is in the U.S. in prison and for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Exactly as on Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate on television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite of the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. this is not because a company such as multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The dates of sevened companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they can predict by data analysis of flu, the worst kind, predictions -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It functioned properly, year round year, until it suddenly had no more functional,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data is sevened firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all this faults, data changes in decisions of life -- in the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should prefer to make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- a territory where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have known some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and non-successful decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">At first, you place this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the parts; as a wide, you put the individual parts back together to take a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things to fall apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to take a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to compose the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to compose again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to put a good discharge -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think it was Netflix so successful because they used data and mind, where they can also go in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they otherwise would not have been able to. but the decision on how to take all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they did a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all of their decisions, first as they who competed by TV-ideas, then as they chose "Alpha House" as the show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "this is what the data we say" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is only a tool, and in order to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball," it is amazing. for decisions made using a Jaor No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely, -- just here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will be able to fade it later with a Technikdemo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by something much more washed, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic construction.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball will cling and wiser and wiser. ultimately it is up to us to make decisions, if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data is still paying off, decisions to make, an expert in what you are doing, and risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
