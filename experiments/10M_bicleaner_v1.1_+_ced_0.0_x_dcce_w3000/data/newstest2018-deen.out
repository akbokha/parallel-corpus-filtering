Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that can change your view to the city
a Irish Anst@@ alt , where young people will encounter today .
a Gru@@ y@@ kap@@ elle , where now for the S @-@ Bahn @-@ Tunnel will be du@@ g .
small@@ ness are cultiv@@ ating the single @-@ term basis of farmers .
the oldest official ticket of Munich also encourages exciting stories to days .
it is more nervous when maps are not current .
this knows each one who had to watch for some time , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was instead of a revers@@ al street to a green meadow .
the historical maps of the Digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al of Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but currently very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ r ep@@ p@@ ich , which you do not recognize as such .
in the large .@@ postcard for towns and villages more detailed maps , so @-@ called jud@@ ging blades were incorporated .
this originated according to the Bay@@ er@@ isches Ver@@ mess@@ enger management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 , and from the first sur@@ vey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition of War with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an to@@ po@@ graphical recording of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops took place with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a surface @-@ covering Bavaria card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph pushed the project further , founded the &quot; to@@ po@@ graphical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ enger management .
the ch@@ ading system for Munich is from the year 18@@ 56 and can be found like the other on the Bavaria &apos;s website .
the comparison of the morning / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded throughout all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ missions that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after building the map , i.e. 1877 , as Mün@@ chner district .
today sub@@ missions are in the middle of the city .
the houses of under@@ scores are concentrated at 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today the West park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when Hin@@ gene lines there appears a small@@ ish map with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : handmade Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; which was derived from the basic tax .
small plots have no farmers left there - but the small res@@ ser of the plant &quot; Land of Sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterized by the north of the sub@@ missions .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 show@@ reel of the Okto@@ ber@@ in tests , was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychi@@ atric medicine .
in the word leaf@@ let , one reads in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the arrival &quot; On the air , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße man once attacked people with mad@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mün@@ chner Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded in 18@@ 58 / 59 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den put the establishment - that psychi@@ atr@@ ist who is associated with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended the purchase of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has banned the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged itself in an exhibition with the Anst@@ alt Museum .
for 280 patients had at first been a place , later it was extended to 500 places .
sometime , this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
since 2006 there is the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Ost @-@ East Germany , one of Germany &apos;s largest lawyers in Germany .
at the real of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet in Mün@@ chner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the or@@ den was the building complex 1920 and walked in a youth @-@ home with training schemes .
West is located by the TS@@ V Munich East , east of the museum houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the kids &quot; House &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in an architec@@ tur@@ ally ten@@ dence to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt made in the Second World War were destroyed during the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was about 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
a big stayed until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once carried out at Mari@@ enhof , where this day was the lead and on 5 April 2017 the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the a@@ erial photograph of today - and the hole in the Mari@@ enhof fill up .
civil rights group publ@@ ishes Dest@@ inations for Miss@@ ouri
the National Association for the promotion of colored people has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Miss@@ ouri based on discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel advisory for the Federal State of Miss@@ ouri , who take effect until 28 August 2017 , invites visitors to take special attention in travel through the state , since a number of question@@ ed , racial re@@ based inci@@ dents occur in the entire state and can be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it is in the position of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law of Miss@@ ouri , which allows people to gain dis@@ proportion@@ ate complain , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the State , dis@@ proportion@@ ate the group to release the travel , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of citizens &apos; rights , men .
they are lifted because of their skin colour , they are gathered together or killed , &quot; said the President of Miss@@ ouri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such frequency , which we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that has issued the Organisation for a state in the United States .
the group po@@ ign@@ ited inci@@ dents like r@@ assi@@ stic understanding against black students at the University of Miss@@ ouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under frag@@ ran@@ ding circumstances at the beginning of the year after being taken in cust@@ ody during the journey through the state and was taken in cust@@ ody by the police of Miss@@ ouri in cust@@ ody without a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also pointed to a recent report by the general state of the general state @-@ state of Miss@@ ouri in which it is shown that black motor@@ ists in the state will be 75 percent more common than past@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Miss@@ ouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to bring light money or to know the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miss@@ ouri recorded in 2015 100 Hass@@ l@@ ner , after the latest figures from the Hass@@ en@@ eb@@ urg @-@ reporting program of F@@ BI , which began the state with regards to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
the itinerary is also an answer to a new Miss@@ ouri law that would make it harder to complain about a business because of housing or employment .
previously the American Civil War lasted for Texas and Arizona ( AC@@ LU ) travel routes for Texas and Arizona , after the states to commit immigration regulations to susp@@ ect humans for immigration causes , which will be contributing to further forms of racial understanding .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries but in recent times , stakeholders have implemented the measure response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ dec@@ aying project is elementary
the fishing bacher Wei@@ dez@@ hen project is a success project and continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag , Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have created a picture on the spot .
in the Recht@@ grab@@ enhof of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family met representatives of the fishing bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schwen@@ n@@ mann gives first insights into its operation , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk , and as well as many young animals , and in five apartments of holiday houses .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ m@@ ch &quot; is for him the altern@@ ate market for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
the table of the f@@ eng@@ f@@ fort comes exclusively region@@ ally .
as he is also a BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he describes the Wei@@ ght@@ ens project as &quot; elementary &quot; . &quot;
I can not cultiv@@ ate such steep areas in a profitable way .
the green space for a lot of work , much m@@ ts with the engine sense are processed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and with the Top@@ graphics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ al operation and observed this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even though it is not a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has detected the importance of the Wei@@ bel @-@ project and is pleased with the leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leader &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are would have to be supported by farmers .
we hope that the rising of the plots could still be done for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure that we have is people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism due to funding
a total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the open area is thus 40 h@@ ect@@ are , which can not be rest@@ led until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euros was funded half of the Leader , a quarter carried out the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus , the farmers have had to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ dez@@ hen .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and country @-@ wives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even for Peter Weiss stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ s@@ account@@ ant line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of ordination .
the objective is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
prere@@ quis@@ ites is the presence of one of the L@@ PR prof@@ ici@@ cul@@ t .
in addition , the en@@ closure area may not be less difficult ( hang@@ over 35 per cent ) and must thus be threatened by the acceler@@ ation .
for the fishing bacher Wei@@ de@@ ton project 2018 , the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 plots that want to build nearly 16 kilometers of fence .
the open surface is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing more sacred ?
now , the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking off the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they start to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans cher@@ ish these as well as any other - hence the car@@ ni@@ fied Stur@@ z Saddam H@@ uss@@ one on the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew certainly what he did when he wrote a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dra@@ stic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller is not a statue itself .
a hor@@ de of jet@@ ties and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have suffered from him if he had done it .
but he laid hold on their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was written by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go here on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tened the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem on which you refer to which was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he form@@ ulated it itself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the elaborate words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your mind , thy poor , / your pressed masses , which will soon longing , free to breathe , / the el@@ ic@@ uous waste of your rich coast . &quot;
there never was a time when the &quot; mis@@ led waste &quot; was better to see on our scre@@ ens .
Miller is not committed to liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the m@@ umps .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural examination : it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus and her friends who campa@@ ign@@ ed to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they have been a high @-@ political act .
the sculpture should show the ties between French and American rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the Freedom .
Laz@@ arus did change this meaning : in its poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has got a voice .
and they themselves are a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly how Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to withdraw from the right wing this long time .
the big s@@ cribe to R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the B@@ apt@@ ist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed that the Statue of Liberty is question@@ ed , but rather an early neo @-@ con@@ serv@@ atives , who bring the American flame into the um@@ id@@ ed world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch is not meant to enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here upon something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative action of Laz@@ arus consisted of Laz@@ arus was to see her from the exhau@@ stive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the Dec@@ ks of ships was seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that you would ever want to recognize the Miller and Tr@@ ump .
their tor@@ ch is not meant to enligh@@ ten the way , but the hat@@ red who is their only source of power to ign@@ ite .
Weltmeisterschaft 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ bt Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two vill@@ i have belonged to the team of Great Britain
the Executive Director of Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member quot@@ a quot@@ a in the World Championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ete was chosen for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes in Scotland something special , and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the UK has to learn from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue to continue until we figure it , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ete think that it has something to do with what she has done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the sch@@ ot@@ tic athletes are medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - that will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the team to the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is rather modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a series of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , they went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated .
the passion and the real feel , the E@@ ili@@ ie brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ silver med@@ alli@@ g@@ writer , which is present with its fifth world cup at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; unbelievable , &quot; that 16 hits in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the mu@@ ir @-@ run@@ ners Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has placed five British and two European records in the last year .
it will take part in the 1,@@ 500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs the 1,@@ 500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team @-@ cap@@ tivity to say that they are &quot; huge pro@@ ud@@ ly &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about Team @-@ surrender is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour , but knowing that my team @-@ mates wrote for me and chose I make it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it shows only how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to go on po@@ e@@ dies .
what are my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking the critics concerning Facebook : take you not a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the brain of voters
the Father of our land knew some of the bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers took it because of everything , from the domestic policy to its political principles .
he sho@@ ok upon the criticism , surely .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led as the sheep to s@@ laughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to govern@@ or Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an who needs to work more like Washington .
Ho@@ fer employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil liberties def@@ endant him at the beginning of this week .
the rod of Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ urs left the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when there is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is an Republi@@ can govern@@ or in a completely democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ or of the nation .
Hog@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand at the guidance of his state and strict adh@@ er@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as primary means to link up with his voters and playing his ha@@ iry gar@@ ment after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the block@@ ade of people who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and paid by employees , which are paid as officially - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ an Spe@@ akers in Amelia Ch@@ asse the actions of the govern@@ or and argu@@ ed that the block@@ ade of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too simple to use the image of TRO@@ LL@@ EN or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ated people who swing online the wh@@ ip .
the mail spoke to some of the real people blocked by the Hog@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no t@@ roll .
they all said that their comments are respectful , thought@@ ful and not profound .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ated , but she asked about hate .
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other latest news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people taking place on the same subject , they are more likely rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the employees of the govern@@ or were referred to as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ate . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a cr@@ itic or delete a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lines and to burn them or to silence them .
but just this happens digital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hog@@ an is not the first public official he crit@@ ici@@ zed that he imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Tr@@ ump is cur@@ ved by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter @-@ Fe@@ ed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Vir@@ gina .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County ver@@ ted the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the US District , James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , as they called a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit to the AC@@ PI because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the moment Washington had the time of affordable Por@@ tos to a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter attached to his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had an anonymous t@@ roll .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , the p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ ri@@ cola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions , which crit@@ ici@@ zed its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trade and navigation with the United Kingdom , according to the historical documents compiled by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not have it to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ course belong to the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting these .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes about home comfort in the Renaissance club
the former Europeans Nr. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort during the next three days , since the Renaissance Club will be held in East Lot@@ hi@@ an , 25 edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re who ran in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links until the end of the year before he lost to Paul E@@ ales , with the new Australian office and acts as a tournament b@@ amb@@ assador on behalf of the club @-@ founder and CE@@ O Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Ex@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry has made a great job when he was arrested this place .
he is a eager advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; it really feels special , &quot; said that in South@@ port indigenous players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have failed to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because it won the year after I had won it out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories come back last year and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on last year to win here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the home in this year .
this event will be the first Scottish presence since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh Friday .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can also feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I have played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how it went through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio at the field are the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ urst , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ faculty .
Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance will be among the six shells on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ros@@ s Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds are to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary lo@@ aves through Passi@@ v@@ rau@@ chen
in the past two decades , fewer people have died due to passive lung cancer .
at this result , scientists of the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , per year 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary waste is attri@@ but@@ able to Passi@@ v@@ rau@@ chen , &quot; said Study manager Heiko Becher .
as a comparison , he moved his own study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time there was still 400 pul@@ mon@@ th@@ es@@ sto@@ di@@ aries due to Passi@@ v@@ smok@@ ers per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house @-@ closures prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lying as much as time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the leader of the Bau@@ ma Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground , much wast@@ ed , which may not be noted in the plans .
the traffic , which always imp@@ eded the construction works , represents a big problem for the ru@@ c@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignor@@ ance of motor@@ ists from red traffic lights and ab@@ uses is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the lens @-@ buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p are working with work on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were really hard @-@ ti@@ ring .
but luckily we were powered by our friend Fritz Matt with all mineral water , &quot; tells Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the ind@@ on@@ esian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cook@@ s the dinner , she does not use stove .
it even rarely used a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ anz in the un@@ quiet Indon@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally than &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the enc@@ ycl@@ ed tu@@ bers is taken with ze@@ fri@@ ght , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - it has no furniture - where she also performs its daily work , e.g. gar@@ ments with cold water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of four wives of her husband , you were not assigned to their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ ie is here usual .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there is the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es , after 5 p.m. in the village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ ot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in Indonesia after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 el@@ dest should vote in front of the occupation forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red for independence against the Dutch rule , turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who keeps control of the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or judicial monitoring .
in 2003 the Province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part Pap@@ ua New Guinea had covered the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it &apos;s . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with car rental .
there are no public transportation .
the city with about 19,@@ 000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses that are surrounded by bam@@ boo , and made of cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs , which were converted by R@@ ost in various yellow @-@ brown shades .
only very few Indon@@ esian made their journey here , let the journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Army P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her livel@@ i@@ red , hand@@ leb@@ ed Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esian province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst children of mort@@ ality and alphab@@ eti@@ zation rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is situated only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a stron@@ gh@@ old in the great@@ ness of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was built in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources worth a valued 78 billion US dollars .
but these ri@@ ches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indon@@ esian is em@@ powered by military force .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local mil@@ itia and units of 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 USD in a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ ian calls for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this Golden G@@ ans and are addressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to data of activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been viol@@ ated by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 .
mass evalu@@ ations in Pap@@ u@@ as stem es@@ hoch@@ land in 1970 @-@ he years were published in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission on genocide .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police reported last year more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the Every@@ thing in a report of the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane in 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year include , such as de@@ form@@ ations and torture , and power plants are particularly popular according to another report - and brutal ra@@ zz@@ iness and peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims as every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researchers for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % christ@@ ian@@ ally , but demo@@ graphic development changes , as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .
Jav@@ anese War@@ ning @-@ Cant@@ ine sell ro@@ fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sau@@ ce .
local people are fighting for sharing here .
&quot; the migrants have begun , chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua to sell , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , which attracted to the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian president J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election , 2014 the ine@@ qualities and the violations of law in Pap@@ ua .
the former car@@ p@@ enter assure 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua , little changed , and now the locals feel tri@@ cked .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we agreed in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai learned only two months after j@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October a deep @-@ point .
on December 7 , 2014 was a group of 11 children out and sang christ@@ mas@@ ks in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the scar@@ ed children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participating in her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who drank , hunt and sm@@ ote the group with their gun , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers into the group of children .
a child who was 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard be@@ aten to fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set in fire and the things escal@@ ated on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football spot in front of the local police station and the military centre , to demand justice .
they carried out cerem@@ onial so@@ cks and led the Wa@@ ita dance - on the circle continuously and a bird @-@ spec@@ ulative - by Pap@@ u@@ as mee P@@ ago @-@ tribe vor .
some protest@@ ers started stones at police and military out@@ post .
when the mood has been kept heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses play more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat of the threat and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I was suddenly shot in my lin@@ ke wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colour@@ ful wooden building .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who has folded but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered together .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were le@@ ased , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fic@@ us You@@ w has been hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; I ran@@ ged to him and studied his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esian only a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I k@@ issed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the che@@ qu@@ ity of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ or@@ ations , that his officers would only want to &quot; back &quot; back , &quot; because they will be attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more inju@@ ries .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks H@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he sympath@@ ies sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ inging the historical mis@@ eries in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety ister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he gave an extra@@ judicial mechanism to conf@@ use historical violations of human rights violations .
but the ex@@ iles began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injury appeared long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
the point is that we have oblig@@ ated to address these violations , but there are processes that must be through , &quot; he said .
then he did a retreat , when he said on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said , he did not have any plans in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN , indic@@ ted the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua said , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai preference . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims made such claims with gri@@ ms .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , were scar@@ ed to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was be@@ aten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the army sought after me , &quot; says he .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a leg @-@ ir@@ ma that refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were wo@@ unded , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , of dro@@ w@@ ned , when he was caught in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
supported ro@@ omm@@ ates protest@@ ed in front of the company &apos;s office office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were to officers in officers who rep@@ lied war@@ med by waiting for warning .
but domestic people say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the amount and a kill .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who resi@@ des near the hospital and witness as the verses has been delivered quickly here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to account the officers of the officers and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a dor@@ man@@ t for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the com@@ mon@@ y army , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many adh@@ ered to the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by cap@@ turing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and ab@@ duction by ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers .
some of the Top @-@ O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai , thousands of people have been arrested and random in cust@@ ody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty will strengthen dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as apart range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and Fru@@ it and Fru@@ its .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they reserve the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a tasted only 10,000 Indon@@ esian herds ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities grew among the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants that have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight gro@@ wers .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to guide their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not keen to stay in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ l@@ amp Long@@ ch@@ amp was de@@ ported because of poor coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the movies .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is elec@@ toral campaign , to raise the restrictions of reporting to enhance transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esian , un@@ quiet ast@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbors Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pairs of countries - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ seln and the Sal@@ om@@ onen @-@ Inseln - the UN @-@ Human Rights , to investigate the &quot; different and widely spread inju@@ ries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian State of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed the acc@@ us@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ amb@@ assador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that took part in the session , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia also has a presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not be able to agree on again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in Pan@@ i@@ ai k@@ iss@@ ing , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is living under the constant threat of a military army , located in arm@@ ament and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; that he has to rep@@ ay .
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation led families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ offering @-@ offering a final symbolic act of the d@@ ator : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly in front of the police and the military station .
they know they might never come to justice , but at least they do not forget the persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with divine head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscr@@ apers of Dubai for the second time
a fire took on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai its fin@@ als and forced hundreds of inhabitants from the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ sto@@ rey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years through the Hoch@@ haus , which one is random@@ ly called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building has been ev@@ acu@@ ated , inju@@ ries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we are at the fire alarm system and writing the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to come down , &quot; told a resident , who called his name as George &apos;s , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting on 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ pm GMT ) the fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished and the building cooler .
the government said , they work on the provision of accommodations for those concerned .
the incident can have questions about the safety of materials used in all areas of skyscr@@ apers in all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 discovered that the biggest part of the damage from the swe@@ ar , the outer gar@@ ments for decoration or insulation , came .
in Great Britain , the police , they think that the system of plates for insulation and disgu@@ ise in the London Gren@@ ad@@ ur Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ce in June , where about 80 people died .
not Davis Cup @-@ Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his great Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup tournament were only supported on two winn@@ ings , skin @-@ thin is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the most often very long , but also therefore very much estimated five @-@ set @-@ classics remain the tradition of tradition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just under a lack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our membership posts have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the assessment .
at all , not only for the vote was the proposal made , after many times the proposal came to spread the finals on a neutral place .
new from 2018 , only compar@@ atively smaller details : how will the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be able to have the host right in the first round .
to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements are made in terms of training courses etc . and players will have to do less official media dates prior to the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers brings forbidden articles into aer@@ op@@ lane , will find a survey
a survey among passengers suggested that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ately or un@@ consciously free articles on the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration is over narrow , including at least 6 per cent , which carried the plane while they acci@@ d@@ ently b@@ obs@@ cured knife or other items with blade .
less than 1 per cent discomfort , they would have been bel@@ ated that they have been er@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey conducted over 1,000 people - that was carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ atos Jet Char@@ ter Inc . , was also firm , that younger travellers are more likely to abuse the rules .
by the respon@@ dents , the states that they were kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , was 19.@@ 7 per cent of mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that have been assigned to T@@ SA agents , were foods and liqui@@ ds .
more than 3 percent made to know kno@@ w@@ ingly items with blade by the safety control , whereas 2,2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3,@@ 7 per cent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they would have taken l@@ enti@@ vely ver@@ ted drugs into the aircraft .
the company said , I asked people across the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally designed sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware due to the airport security and how many things were int@@ enti@@ onally done .
it is no surprise that people who sm@@ ug@@ gled the best sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware - kno@@ w@@ ingly or not kno@@ w@@ ingly -- by security , those were those most often fly .
but the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain about the liqui@@ ds they may take or how much of it .
there is therefore no surprise that the biggest quantity of the amount consumed by T@@ SA are protected flu@@ ids .
a time long thought the people , the T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware .
liqui@@ ds are not allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers stor@@ ing order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k will be happy to have a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has hi@@ ther@@ to suggest that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
beside the always tri@@ umph@@ ant numbers of sales and still gigantic sales aim has Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k at the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly report , for the first time , a less gl@@ oss number betra@@ yed : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had often advert@@ ised more than 500@@ ,000 reservations in recent months for the new car , whose goods are just beginning .
now mush@@ room mus@@ k one : of the total 5@@ 18,@@ 000 pre@@ orders have been with@@ drawn 6@@ 3,000 again .
critics were always pointed out that they are merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
if cancellation pays Tes@@ la the 1000 Euros ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment will be complete .
at present , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are presented , sp@@ elled mus@@ k in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
that the cancellation of so far has about twelve per cent of all orders to be addressed , the Tes@@ la chef does not believe .
its argument - the challenge for ambitious growth target is not on demand , but on the production site .
in the past year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered .
2018 : all models have to be combined - 500@@ ,000 its , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , at present a day 1800 reservations are made .
who today ordered a &apos; Model 3 &apos; , must be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 , if Tes@@ la makes it creates its brand @-@ new , never before able to drive its nails with maximum inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum inter@@ rup@@ tions .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but comes to major delays , then the un@@ oblig@@ atory of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then the company cannot take away from satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief pru@@ dence is moving back because of Hin@@ aus@@ z@@ ö@@ ger@@ ns the rules of Obama &apos;s Era to reduce emissions
one day after having been su@@ aded by 15 states , Scott pru@@ dence , the chief of the environmental protection authority , his former decision back to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions bi@@ ds .
Pru@@ itt presented the change as his agency dism@@ issed the needs of the governmental authorities towards real time than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which was raised against his previous place in a federal state of occupation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period that ran on October 1st for states to adh@@ ere to the standards of 2015 for down spaces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; pru@@ ure announced in June that he would delay the compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid ob@@ struc@@ tur@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pru@@ dent , who was inst@@ ig@@ ated in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ ut@@ or of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was long time a reliable opponent of serious environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , Pru@@ T has repeatedly expressed , regul@@ ations to block or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the recent legal set @-@ back for the Pru@@ d@@ regulatory Roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA has passed its authority as he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ ane hammer .
in one on Wednesday evening , I suggested that his turn@@ around at O@@ zon@@ standards is quite simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of timely adoption of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administrative bodies , the EPA has often denied the dead@@ lines for performing groups and tried to be indic@@ ted by activ@@ ating activists and others , and in an agreement to set the appointment for the implementation , &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the EPA more than a dozen time in its previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us very seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EPA approved that it will eventually use its &quot; competences to delay and all other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information is based . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can Congress of Congress are pushing for a wider re@@ formation of the o@@ zone rules .
a last month approved , the implementation of the rules of 2015 will delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been made in the Senate yet .
the New York @-@ General @-@ General , Eric In@@ der@@ man , who challenged the coalition of the states who had w@@ ailed the EPA in that week , said the Group would intend to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our clar@@ ification - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans affected by the smo@@ g , who flows into their communities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said C@@ utting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Min@@ nes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .

representatives of the public health sector and the environ@@ ment@@ alist che@@ ered over Pru@@ d@@ ism changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is troub@@ ling how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for protecting the air we inhal@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to continue fighting against the ide@@ ological cru@@ x of the tick @-@ tick on environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celeb@@ rates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church

so there are people there .
as out of the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf which today seems to be recognized today in the village of Tum@@ ops , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glori@@ ette sett@@ ler of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 back these historical conditions .
the patron saint has been created from the earliest medieval owner &apos;s right .
one Lord , who built a church , hand@@ held and occupied with a priest , remained the pecu@@ liar tendency of this church and could also inher@@ it this pecu@@ li@@ arities .
associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to strike the Bishop a new priest .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells in the tower .
the Gre@@ ater of the two de@@ bar@@ red for Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell set then for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the window plates were placed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was im@@ tight .
17@@ 96 lag@@ il@@ ened French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they erup@@ ted out the pul@@ pit and church @-@ chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church dro@@ pping 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also used as last rest@@ ing for the dead out of hear@@ ers .
18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the help of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche .
only the church tower had to be left .
in the Neu@@ jahr@@ sn@@ acht 18@@ 34 sp@@ elled a storm the church tower and half cr@@ ashes .
to prevent an un@@ happiness , the tower was canc@@ eled .
only the current tur@@ m@@ te@@ wer@@ g today remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history .

club aims to check the approval of Wind@@ wheels
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim w@@ ax@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see the legal basis for construction and therefore has turned towards the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) required to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen merely on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal there exists a wind power @-@ concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time causes the concentration of wind turbines for the remaining area of wind turbines .
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had already decided a few days before a change in the surface area in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , which was not approved by the District government Düsseldorf , because of a f@@ ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of plan@@ ing legal prerequisite , the author@@ itative author@@ ization is still illegal and therefore to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Erk@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the city council entered again the wind@@ ling zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette once again ; a permit of the District government still stands out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cold : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been given for last week with the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle has the opportunity to examine the matter again .
but they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with view of the ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to vote in the arg@@ um@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , an subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high wind wheels .
last year , the company had already participated in the town of Vier@@ sen , P@@ oc@@ y@@ ields with the owner of about 65 hectares of great money .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the power consumption of around 11 400 households can be covered - this is equivalent to approximately one fifth of all qu@@ artet for all four households .
the NEW gradu@@ ates want to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sens Stad@@ elmann gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind energy system in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ ashes together : Ms dies at terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ s@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was fatal .

the national road remained closed across hours .
according to law enforcement , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch was driving with their passenger in the frame of accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year mother as a companion , the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; Home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to explore shopping in the city center in September .
the busin@@ ess@@ verein and the Munici@@ pal Author@@ ities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping center in the city center .
as the Chairman of the busin@@ ess@@ ver@@ one , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shop &quot; has to sens@@ it@@ ise the customers to sens@@ it@@ ise the offer from their own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ goods .
according to a market with regional vendors , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , the companies are to present themselves with their apprenti@@ ces@@ hips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to be invited to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ tern@@ ach@@ ts @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion is not limited to residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King .
municipal authorities and commercial organizations collaborate with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
this means the busin@@ essm@@ an association and the city into another stage of the project &quot; appeal to downtown . &quot;
this includes new promotions such as the first &quot; acti@@ v @-@ Day &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ fest , in talks with all the busin@@ ess@@ men and hosts , to move it for active participation .
attractive offers for Saturday and decor@@ ations on parking fee on this day are part of the concept .
furthermore , customer potenti@@ als can be re@@ developed new or back again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the inner city when buying from the view .
at the end , all of them would have to contribute to the inner city - to land@@ lords , the establishments of the whole city and associations .
it praised to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ ie with a network that had taken part , had been king in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen shared with the fact that the nation@@ wide third &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home @-@ shop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ day , first five Thür@@ inger cities participate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day shall advertise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the esteem of the local trade and its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the suspension of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can be influenced by his busin@@ essm@@ an environment .

Tr@@ ump replaced the trans@@ cribed trans@@ cription by phone calls Mexico under pressure due to payment of the border walls .
trans@@ cription by telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leader of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27th , Tr@@ ump called for a telephone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop publicly say that he would not pay for an planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. president aud@@ ition@@ ed him because he says the Wall publicly announced , saying that he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can not say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall to the southern border of the USA , and sp@@ or to pay Mexico for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trans@@ cription of his first appeal with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ stag were also published and un@@ covered a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ hout that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the beast urged to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he said Mr Turn@@ stag , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable phone call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury by a group of spect@@ ators in the rural Monroe , Georgia , and r@@ umped on the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men turned out to block its path .
the leader of the Mob@@ s - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strip - took a long train at its cig@@ ars and looked after the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gro@@ mm@@ ed the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him from the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie zer@@ ris@@ sen the silence , as a young black man of the passenger has been dist@@ orted by the passenger .
fortunately this horri@@ ble scene which was played on July 22 , just a post@@ ure .
but if a loop is thrown around the neck by &quot; Roger , &quot; nearly all of them in the audience very real si@@ gh .
since 2005 Bürger@@ recht@@ ler zur Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 were fre@@ ed .
nobody was ever indic@@ ted for the mur@@ ders .
&quot; it truly is irre@@ ver@@ able that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks that helps in the organisation of rep@@ airing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt road on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year old convention of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call to action as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want pun@@ itive , we want the end , we want healing , we want healing , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tri@@ part@@ ition@@ ers lays a du@@ vet cover over the bodies of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI , received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding County were verd@@ ant in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody was ever indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects have been on free walking for decades , they say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch &apos;s activities in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 he allowed a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice to enter the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , at the pre @-@ election in summer its voice .
about at the same time as the choice st@@ ems according to data of the F@@ BI of black Far@@ mp@@ ton Roger Mal@@ com one white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed from the prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge appro@@ ached , around a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , includes a F@@ BI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also evident that there was a plot between state and local criminal proceedings , which was not only involved in the mor@@ den , proo@@ fing and identity of witnesses has failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks still formulated it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an elec@@ toral mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
nearly a decade long , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the yearly exhibition of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vi@@ vid , gri@@ pping and explained in a kind of deep racism then many believe that he is no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and still harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are then confronted with its har@@ ness in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I have done . &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and lau@@ ght , as a Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ made overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is hier Gru@@ enes Co @-@ Regisse@@ ur .
he has played the role of the head @-@ member member since the year , but he said that the role will never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to those times . &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the har@@ p@@ est sh@@ outing and pus@@ hes him , angry that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n -- he , disappeared from my own property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ dert the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everyone is breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs on the lau@@ est .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ arm@@ ament and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gl@@ it@@ ching . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you just need to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly as it shi@@ fts the energy in the room , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona the N @-@ Word says , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely nobody laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends non @-@ violent and fast .
there are hor@@ semen , shots and then silence .
a woman , with a dream dress is cloth@@ ed over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and leads scre@@ ens holidays gri@@ pping te@@ ens &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost un@@ even@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , mostly to see the performance , many come only down the road .
they have seen all almost eight hours long Geor@@ gi@@ as de@@ hydr@@ ated moisture when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the excav@@ ation of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de furn@@ ish , the air feels del@@ ectable .
when the last notes of the song ends , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and to insp@@ ect the ly@@ x@@ t@@ name .
kids ho@@ oks on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ pers to each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , as if he wanted to remember it .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks a lot - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ n@@ eil away and make her tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in an an@@ zug which has played the member member .
Nick Sand@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players and then cr@@ acks down in her arms , the emotional load of the ab@@ duction eventually breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ing one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sets out together with the actors for dinner .
on a table a white pair made of Atlanta stim@@ ulated about the appearance of a black pair which they have just come to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which has left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you themselves and do what they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me , lets me believe that the Lyn@@ chen still goes on , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &apos;s yard holds on his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance in the next year .

EPA returns to delay the smo@@ g usually after charges
the American environmental protection authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama so that the states are oblig@@ ated to em@@ ate the states that are smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was made a day after 15 States exp@@ ended the agency due to the p@@ unch .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so called &quot; O@@ zon@@ policies 2015 &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and to respond to our state partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chef Scott Pru@@ er in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June the purpose of the EPA had announced the EPA to specify the O@@ zone specifications in which in part of the country &apos;s harmful emissions need to establish where sub@@ sections will need to delay the stric@@ ter aviation standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 15 largely democratic countries , together with the District of Colombia , went on Tuesday morning and said that the attempt was illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried a broad range of environmental templates , which has imposed former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the back@@ rests of the Democrats and reserves , which are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can increase the breathing symptoms , &quot; such as as@@ thma .
community wants common areas
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ part , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ winds b@@ lows the establishment of a common space in the future senior residence .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the even missing piece of property was signed , reported Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it still will take before the church had been part of the church community , however , there is now no planning stage for that of a private investor to st@@ em@@ ate project more .
there is a discussion about a common area .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered the community to meet .
on the ground floor , he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council float outside , such a common room just do not see as a meeting place only for residents of the sovereig@@ n living space , but open to the community .
as an example , the word made from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
reconc@@ iling the decision to be decided by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget already last autumn by means of funding .
the building is located in the refurb@@ ishment .
the establishment of a common area would be , such as T@@ yo@@ ades reports , 60 percent of 30 percent are con@@ du@@ ci@@ ful .
the proposed resolution provides to signal the investor that in this respect no b@@ ill@@ ation may throw between the legs , the finding that both a saddle - which reduces the ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes up the height and the construction of economical - can be possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ ers , be this promise .
when it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously happening it happens to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings where you can not go so right now , one is now living with the common room in the window , says it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger necessarily refers to the common room - but absolutely a local participation .
it looks behind it a cover@@ t sub@@ vention to anyway comp@@ elling or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the purchase of the area one does not give grants , but to come to a real , in doubt , in doubt , is the counter@@ speaking .
stage request , to decre@@ e the decisions according to decre@@ asing , finds three supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , with two counter@@ ing the original program , Stefan H@@ alle makes it so together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision so we make a giant steps to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Har@@ z from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Har@@ z , the nation@@ wide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is born . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planning the association astronom@@ ically Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ visitors , it meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he uni@@ fy nature , science , movement and sport@@ y power .
the members want to set up along the planned route boards and inform about stars and star pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gut achiev@@ able installations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question@@ ing St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards will be added by the internet .
that &apos;s why at the selection selection , a good mobility network play a role .
also Acc@@ essibility be a crit@@ erion .
later the star trail is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ base path , the viewer learned a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of each stars , &quot; explained the association .
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star stronger lumin@@ aire than another , although it is much farther away .
con@@ veys also , in which con@@ stellation can be a sel@@ ectable star , and when it is best to see .
since 2014 , the association has been operating since 2014 in the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is located at the highest largest astronom@@ ical ob@@ servatory in North America .
the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the Federal Republic of Har@@ z to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently , from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the university city , there has been an initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Göttingen : something similar to the planned star @-@ value - the Planet@@ en@@ weg .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , leads the planet path with its poles up to Hain@@ berg and for an ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( commun@@ e ) with the Planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ elen with the individual planets - including that to the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned at exactly the distance and scale from one to two billion .
the earth r@@ umped so on a bul@@ b of 6.5 milli@@ meter in diameter , whereas the exact 75 meters from the standing sun has a total of 70 centi@@ meters .
the entire distance of the Planet@@ en@@ we@@ ges is just four kilometers .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour until the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march for the next fixed , but would last a six months .

Gar@@ cia out@@ stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How do you think Champion ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
as the couple for photos posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am up for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to download on light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
these demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxes need this battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klim@@ as asked if it should be in Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enko with an 135 Po@@ und debut in this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , which also has an interest in the struggle against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after its lightweight @-@ style competition in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and were later openly talking to the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , he also appreciate Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous figh@@ ter &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko was at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the tri@@ ples champion from River@@ side , &quot; very slow , sorry , Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show percussion , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum , which built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle which must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work to work , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and this is Mik@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be an amazing battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four Ver@@ t after tire @-@ plat@@ zer
during an accident on the A7 , four persons had been inju@@ red for part in the rest of the year .
after the first information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the exit market . probably after a tire @-@ plat@@ ter will probably take control of his vehicle .
the passenger cars to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he beat down and then stayed on the roof at the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ ST@@ RI@@ B@@ ES .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were not inju@@ red during the accident .
during the initial supply of the last by the bail@@ out service , the A7 was locked in the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be buried at the exp@@ iry point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Triple chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andre Hoffmann ho@@ fft after 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that brings the optimization of the defence formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first string of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , if not the two oppos@@ ites would have been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two enemies too much , and we have to adapt better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defence of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the rotating chain is also to be further optim@@ ised .
and a door after a free partition , the Fort@@ unas want to f@@ alter even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) places on line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experience in preparation with the thres@@ hing chain , than with the four @-@ seat chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach of Fried@@ hel@@ m Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is his thing for sure , &quot; Bec@@ ause we have just finished in the triple chain on the half @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Niko G@@ ieß@@ elmann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequisite is , but that we even better harmon@@ ise and do not make so many distr@@ actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you cannot speak after a draw from a mis@@ erable start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; argu@@ ed Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the Pok@@ al , we will certainly speak of a single string . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to know nothing .
&quot; the start into the season I suggest only after six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ hel@@ m Fun@@ kel , who wouldn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be dis@@ car@@ ded pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a weather conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e perhaps could be slightly fres@@ her , since they had no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a asc@@ ension into the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % process where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the guests come from the Rhein@@ land as an easy favorite on Sunday in the meeting at finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t know them , only because we have the claim to come under the first six is Bl@@ ond sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fun@@ kel , the balance of only one defeat from nine games is quite positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to hit from the outset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Chef coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ tly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Fun@@ ds wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ assessment tests published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which subjected to a new method for medical assessment of its age , demonstrate that more than 80 percent of the tested persons older than 18 years are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority of for@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( puzzles ) has started conducting tests last year .
they should be more precise during the asylum procedure considering the assessment of the age , having critic@@ ised the Swedish migration agency ( mig@@ r@@ ator ) due to errors in the assessment of correct age of some refugees .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ mistak@@ able 6,@@ 8@@ 80 has sent down cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were rated as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency assessed that the person may be &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person could possibly be under the age of 18 . &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ sch@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are stable in the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged for over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has weigh@@ ed over his age .
in May published the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there was 44@@ 2 cases that suggest that the ordin@@ ate person was 18 years old or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bl@@ ends the 5@@ 81 results analysed , they realized that in 243 these cases the person had openly said that they will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age evalu@@ ations , in x @-@ rays of &quot; thor@@ ns and MR@@ T recordings were made by Kni@@ fe , which are then crit@@ ici@@ zed by dentists and radi@@ ologist , was also crit@@ ici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the end@@ ocr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they left sooner or later by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used .
assessing the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
if we can not say it , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ sch@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of testing : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being a child as an adult is in@@ correctly .
the biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sh@@ ram@@ berg are prog@@ ressing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy duty on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Bau@@ der bei der Abteilung Straßen@@ wesen and Transport im Regier@@ ung@@ si@@ dium Freiburg .
in April the work began at the same time in all three san@@ itation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is certain that the timing is comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
she is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge from concrete , who is disgu@@ ised with red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 50 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
to ensure the stability and road safety , the three works are now thoroughly re@@ structured .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red bun@@ k@@ and@@ stone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Br@@ ück@@ enk@@ appe .
this is a bound@@ ary that is also used as a way of operation .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge is to be used for a 2,20 meter wide breeze .
it should then go away the Foot@@ path .
the special thing is that it is about pre@@ f@@ ells , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already covered with the pat@@ ented quar@@ ures .
particular finger@@ tips has required to implement ad@@ missions through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass maker , that many companies are attached .
the inhabitants were informed about the project in advance of the works .
in addition , first fish and canc@@ ers had to be canc@@ eled .
for the bridges between the building and the umbrella in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by one Amp@@ s .
for building work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is locked .
the costs for the three br@@ ück@@ ings are together 700 000 Euros .
financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German Pot@@ ato
it does not seem so often that parties are moving on a rope , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is just difficult to bring under a hat .
the im Krei@@ dler Vol@@ can@@ es representatives ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad coalition which shows on this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ met@@ a in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell , for the loud poster &quot; great election campaign .
and known names at the start - like Alice White , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land will be the top duo for the Bundestag @-@ election on 24 September , and the Vice @-@ president Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ ro@@ wers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The E@@ if@@ el remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but will now take place at the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ el - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ rod@@ ite event in the Stadthalle .
a colour@@ ful image that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , leader of the Forums A World and one of the leading organizers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people have come here together . &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ancest@@ or potato &quot; that could also eat the Af@@ rod@@ ite , &quot; says the woman who has brought him .
police has many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular at the train station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how is the Af@@ rod@@ ite reached in Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ d Vol@@ can@@ es , he tried to get such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first consul@@ ted in Dau@@ n , but there was a failure , because because of the already established Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : about 20 am on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band of entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse Red@@ ner , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ Chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall are about 200 list@@ eners , which are waiting for the Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ dat@@ as for the Bundestag @-@ election , Alice White , and the dep@@ uty chairman of the Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ k will hold its speeches .
the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour will take the Af@@ for@@ event , the guests on the fore@@ front have a longer breath , but also there is also short after 21 hours .
the police can withdraw - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
a hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is available in the row of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kon@@ gled tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm at the Kloster@@ kirche .
together with the Bulgarian Tromp@@ eter Miros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he meets a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; at Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ ate &quot; applies to classical German education with roots in concert music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are the winners and winners of many international competitions and have op@@ os@@ op@@ positions in European top @-@ plant breeding .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eters at the prestigious Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ cope is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both united the lust , not only cross the borders on their instruments , but also merge the limits of different gen@@ res .
in this way , Johann Sebastian Bach at the two like in a new format , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m , mix classical , jazz and the free playing to a fascinating artwork .
this core of the program was first performed with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m has written it independently for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with her particular acou@@ st@@ ics will be deliber@@ ately involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart absolutely openly about their Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I meet once in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh what was cool , what comes as a neigh@@ bor ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of the lion @-@ stars was the one to her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson which ultimately got bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all the la@@ under@@ ette performer opposite the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in everyone really seriously fallen I have dat@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe about it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation the thr@@ ust gave me that she is bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dering .
I liked it just before being taken seriously . &quot;
specially among them , they said according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school time , when they preferred to dress like a bo@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really has hurt me very seriously .
when I was eleven I said the children , I would look like a book .
I really felt attacked , fri@@ gh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; well , I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public they did not like to live their love @-@ life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way , and that anno@@ yed me .
and perhaps I call me some un@@ grateful but I don &apos;t like it to justify myself before the public . &quot;
govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
- The Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have come from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as a citizen of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic govern@@ or . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a huge announcement of the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was elected 2016 .
For@@ bes represents that he possesses coal mining in five states and inher@@ ited a carbon business by his father .
he is worth $ 1,@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee held a statement on Thursday morning , in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , who would take us more likely than working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legal bodies in history is the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice only the last rejection of a party that is from above to bottom of no leadership and is unable to find a positive , one @-@ sided emb@@ assy , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a declaration called C@@ BS News .
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian fil@@ ing for d@@ oping @-@ sc@@ andal
the world leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he referred to as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be included in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IAAF World Congress at the eve of Ath@@ le@@ tics world Championship , that the ex@@ iles of his country from the sport was correct and that he decided to fight for d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were car@@ ved from competitions of gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IAAF Tribunal for maintaining the For@@ bidden , which was posted in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( W@@ ada ) had found evidence on national sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was today a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IAAF @-@ President Co@@ e said the repe@@ ats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the whole congress were delighted that Russian Federation has seen in itself and that it is experienced quite hot times and everything is possible to make sure the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e said , &quot; he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia once again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize that situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leading principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ l@@ ete from the dead system , he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are beginning to start athle@@ tics throughout London , following the strict IAAF criteria as well as neutral actors .
the head of the IAAF Task Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia will still meet some of the criteria for re@@ inst@@ at@@ ment .
Dro@@ gen@@ tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainer are still free , he said Rep@@ or@@ ters in London after a presentation at the IAAF Council .

at a fun@@ eral party in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ory Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two are meant at a helic@@ opter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the city of high security measures .
to be un@@ resolved , defense of the Defense Minister Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they recorded the two surveys , but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of their professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to see the highest victim , which they did in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old @-@ year @-@ old @-@ race from North@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
her ten@@ derness were transferred to Germany and held on Thursday by a mur@@ der@@ head of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon , firstly only the relatives in the Church goodbye .
then the fun@@ eral party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics .
among them were also Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the sh@@ ep@@ ste laid on ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm up in arms to the senses .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers took the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense minister of the Ley@@ en drew the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brac@@ elet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and inst@@ illed soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ i@@ ehr@@ mann have been built the air @-@ operation of the mar@@ ti@@ pper @-@ fast@@ ener tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six educated tiger in his reg@@ im@@ ents .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur des Reg@@ im@@ ents , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if that occupation could not turn the cr@@ as@@ hing , then it would not have liked . &quot;
doubt at the UN Mission in Mali showed minist@@ ries from the Ley@@ en did not : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country where we are separated only through two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral party the legend were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are sh@@ ad@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want to get a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be pun@@ ched to his death next to his wife .
this shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
traditional is the Danish govern@@ or in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard far already made a coff@@ kop@@ ha@@ g for the two .
the Queen would agree with the decision of their husband , it meant to be in the message .
where Prince &apos;s Hen@@ rik will be bury , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to join in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik has never made a stroke of it , that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ a in 1972 he would gladly become king .
in 2016 he went to retirement and also places the title &quot; Prinz@@ ge@@ ma@@ hl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark don &apos;t get the title and the function he wanted to see he himself is not equal to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , chief cook in the Danish Royal House .
where the last glory of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to join in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the land , for which he has worked for over the past 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ ate , son of a French Ad@@ els@@ au , had met Mar@@ gre@@ den 1965 in London .
on the Thames , he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
during his later woman the sympath@@ iz@@ ations of the people always fled , the Prince of Hen@@ rik had a heavy state in his almost 50 years .
in an auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was all what I did .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smok@@ ed instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and the hier@@ ach@@ ment had the reputation to be the brand social @-@ rit@@ orial intellectu@@ als I could not hope for retro@@ spec@@ tive hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ash@@ amed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wants to make swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green ruling majority for swift re@@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the resolution of the Parliament spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the surprise release of a Green Party in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen was the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the official date of the @-@ day election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the present Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen founded their move with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ z@@ ek Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend to his fac@@ tion to take them up .
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have together 69 seats in the Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on January 14th of the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government shall now decide whether it could go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil keeps it inevitable , however , that the agricultural day decides as quickly as its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U fac@@ tion is expected to decide on Tuesday through their further action .
the provincial version also provides the possibility that the country @-@ day country @-@ President cho@@ oses the confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities have to be legally tested clean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will be discussed in peace all the questions when they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very well . &quot;
it proved itself as an app@@ end@@ in of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the deport@@ ation representative to the return of their country &apos;s country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we certainly assume that it has received her agricultural country , which she has received over the green state list with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; position / a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presi@@ dents of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ent extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she decided not to have any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in front of the background that there were no unacceptable differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor Martin Schulz condemned the over@@ taking of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on green @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ ent to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Gre@@ ens in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen is not only betra@@ yal in voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the chief executive of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) to rebuild the country quickly .
the Austr@@ itt T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their last erup@@ tion and in their Fr@@ ust their personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crit@@ ici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U is involved in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen this dirty int@@ ag@@ l@@ ude and tries to beat its political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U @-@ leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members to record El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .

agriculture ministers in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed over contamin@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can the consumers protect themselves .
Land@@ furn@@ sm@@ in@@ ister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is present in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) State and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against po@@ ckets ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumer consumer and consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ eh@@ .de the federal states provide the most recent information on the concerned @-@ related companies .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if after all we know at this time , a health haz@@ ard is virtually eliminated .
is Al@@ di the best possible crisis @-@ action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the awareness of the Bundes@@ land@@ sm@@ ine is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately turned off and since announ@@ cements of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and the risk assessment will be available to the consumer .
the trade has just as the manufacturer to bear to bear the fact that the products purchased products are in@@ capable and hygien@@ ically safe .
if with eggs of the resi@@ sting content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg , these are not busi@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the businesses to blame .
sitting factories and consumers in the same boat ?
after the process of knowledge , the production facilities do not meet an immediate fault .
on the basis of mut@@ ually illegal practices of service companies , they must be reck@@ oned with economic damages .
as always there is a little contro@@ vers@@ y in harvest@@ ing .
is it only missing on the personal or even on the mud@@ ain@@ able jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
but for truth , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be eliminated to 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially therefore , there is a consequ@@ ent explanation of such action and the transfer to the prosec@@ ution in the cases where criminal off@@ ences may lie , of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been clearly stated several times that I ob@@ servatory a seam@@ less explanation by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular aler@@ s@@ m with food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer and consumer consumer have the right to only get safe and de@@ aler@@ ted foods .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is applied in the food economy , consumer consumer and consumers are rightly indi@@ gn@@ ant .
by the ground@@ ing means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers have got into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
basically , the un@@ law@@ ful use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of living @-@ living animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .

how to regulate the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to Paris
the rules that aim to avoid un@@ resolved issues of European foot@@ prints , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s will not distur@@ b the transfer of Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power , cre@@ ws of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , meaning that PSG to point out at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid $ 222 € ( 262 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PSG can do with safety the money so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes down and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich manor family of Qatar .
associations should contact a lot of money for the purchase of players , but they must be subject to legitimate income sources , which enable them to make the break @-@ related point in their attention to the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini in his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that compar@@ isons had enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively fraud and ris@@ ed to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P moved up to concentration on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change signi@@ fies that the business model , the novel Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then continued vigor@@ ated to build the crew and build a global brand - to a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P contrac@@ ted period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini was like to please by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be seen from excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will still reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P with the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P past week .
although the PSG does not pay the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat job , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signs a five @-@ year treaty , so the rede@@ mption rates for the next five years can be transferred to the amount of 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PSG received a sentence of 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later has been reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the team members are limited to the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is in search of clubs , which could try to over@@ head their financial supervision by joining their revenues by companies , connected by the owners of a club .
while a kat@@ arian company could provide the PSG , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
exactly that happened 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was built by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that some of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar was made on payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PSG and Kat@@ ar 2022 , argu@@ ed that N@@ ey@@ mar World Ambassador will be and an such maneu@@ ver for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators can be just finding out .
the previous sanctions against PSG means that the UEF@@ A will still be careful , every attempt to observe the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared conversation with PSG about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke among the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .
the last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year will still be published .
PSG expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ kot@@ divi@@ des .
the association considers that the turnover of the signature by at least 30 percent will increase .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers to see , and trying to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s way@@ point by claim@@ ing that PSG would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial li@@ d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s owner of the owner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager ar@@ sen@@ ie Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state who finance an association .
&quot; it is a consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial play , because one needs different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a major player in order to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how many applic@@ ants are in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y it .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the schedule , Cho@@ col@@ at will endeav@@ or to make a renewal of the contract beyond the spring 2018 .

nost@@ algia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is at the same time nost@@ alg@@ ically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ er @-@ year Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ cking the Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV turned ) , and for itself - that means for 2001 , before her stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of its absurd human@@ or ( it contained an original story for a speaking jar of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by boo@@ sted on the core of the G@@ ags - actor @-@ aged children , children &apos;s children who grow to grow - nevertheless they make the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the wake @-@ up .
&quot; ten Years later , &quot; with its adults , which are now playing adults , less emoti@@ onally with@@ rooted and his par@@ ody goes more after the found@@ ry , including a reef along the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand , says Ro@@ cks the cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , which looked &quot; the cr@@ adle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character through an Apple Power@@ Book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ walter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , included in the Ronald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ walter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , EX@@ P@@ UR@@ SE are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons sub@@ li@@ pp@@ et of &quot; Singles &quot; , whose former big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
these are the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could make this fran@@ chise may be like a kind of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I &apos;ll show as his logical conclusion : &quot; WET Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years Eve , &quot; whose final scene will show the gang by &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; .

it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .

and the list of the famous narr@@ ator - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick , man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice .

blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police have been a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Mitt@@ week@@ day tomorrow , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart came through numerous objects like the prosec@@ ution , Th@@ urg@@ au on Friday .
15 acc@@ us@@ ation were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 , and have already been arrested in ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
in addition , the officials presented larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundreds of thousands of Euros .
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects there were German ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
the two are probably delivered to Germany to Germany .
the action was Italian and Bay@@ erische Er@@ mitt@@ ler .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in operation .
the members of the Maf@@ ia is organised crime crime , heavy violence , conce@@ aled murder and rob@@ bing and ext@@ or@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already since the summer of 2016 , the prosec@@ ution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stance against organised drug @-@ trading in the South German area &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the prosec@@ ution in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a pure exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had virtually daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo as well as four officials from Palermo .
the spot@@ light of the investigations into the spot@@ light of all the Italian nation@@ als with regard to the Italian Maf@@ ia .

s@@ ings large g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not arise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ igner may have significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum @-@ procedures .
the operator for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen respects , has drawn attention to a media report according to large g@@ aps in the country @-@ Central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the remaining data could lead to asylum proceedings and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bel@@ ong@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis that lies the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , the information is estimated to be ten million people with foreign nation@@ ality , including about 5.@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU states .
the data will therefore be managed according to about 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data was not adequ@@ ately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in individual cases the data of 1921 has been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data entry can considerably slow@@ down back processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics about exclusive people , there are an EU citizen who would not have to leave at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assign@@ ments led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with check @-@ out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it follows in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the federal government obviously began to return a refugee family with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to return to Italy when they arrived there .
this is going out of an internal paper by the Bundes@@ am@@ ts for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; Neue Osnab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees of the EU state , it must first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a migrants are travelling to another EU country , the state can return it to the eland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the grounds write the office now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has substantially increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy has been given for the admission and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ M@@ R ) consider these commitments to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also other EU countries would re@@ claim refugees in the framework of the Dublin agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the inn@@ en@@ political spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , crit@@ ici@@ zed this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children , because of the short@@ com@@ ings in Italian asylum system , un@@ law@@ ful conditions and a haz@@ ard of the chin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bank of England will hold the interest rates of 0,25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and mit@@ igation of inflation led to spec@@ ulation to an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank signed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates at 0,25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has under@@ min@@ ed a rise in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened its support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly assessment , the bank reduced their growth forecasts for 2017 on 1,7 % and for 2018 to 1,6 % and warned that pressure on household income would likely to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years Zin@@ c cav@@ ities would be necessary to grow the bre@@ x@@ ite inflation and she said that the bor@@ rowing costs may possibly exceed the financial markets .
the members also agreed to retreat a part of mamm@@ ut @-@ Konjun@@ ktur@@ pak@@ ets which was issued before a year after Bre@@ xit .
it will require time for finance for banks to provide cheaper funding for banks after the coming February , although it is expected that they will be at least 15 billion pounds longer within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Ster@@ ling .
minutes after deciding on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain weak , since pressure on the realities of households continue to use the consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates , it repe@@ ats that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain pen@@ alties of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent necessary would be expected to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets pre@@ di@@ ct the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grad@@ ual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts for this and next year are projected in comparison to the 1.9 % and 1,7 % compared with the growth in May .
she has maintained its growth forecast on 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound dropped according to the dollar compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % on 1 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 4.8 .
the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ appointing growth pay@@ ers rising on a Zin@@ c cav@@ ity and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be increased in the third quarter , although it will be easily recover after the Bank towards the end of the year .
the recent infl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and low @-@ level observations , since the ti@@ ghtening is first even worse before they get repaired .
she added that the monetary policy in the next few years can not prevent the in@@ coming orders , &quot; but she added that wages have been improved to the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
the economy is also being driven by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound of which a portion of lower consumer expenditure is compens@@ ated .
the decision comes a year after lo@@ wering the interest rates of 0,25 % in the last August , after the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the reproduction .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until the prices and economy will be complete .
before the last judgment of the Bank to the interest rates , the call for a Zin@@ ser@@ mon has increased , since inflation increases the pressure on hard pressing households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation has declined in the last month of 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , though the Bank said that this was expected and will be moved again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the exce@@ eding relative to their aim of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a weak pound to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ reco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the shortest distance of the Swap functions , the mort@@ gage market will be more competitive again since the len@@ ders are strongly sear@@ ched for shops and would like to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly well for those who run the existing deadline and ex@@ clude the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low y@@ ields are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is supposed to be disp@@ er@@ ated with HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transformed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse pre@@ text proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) that can decrease the influ@@ enza risk of about 86 percent , now by health service over a first three @-@ year study , which is estimated to be valued 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appe@@ als had confirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice in the last year , that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess statement announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) this is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are going to be the first to allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 in April 2018 .
pre@@ positioning proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines that may be taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduced HIV @-@ transmission in infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so already two hours before intercourse .
to those who come for treatment in question include pregnant or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants identified to appro@@ ve the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
individuals who live in England and registered with a patient doctor , can also opt for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will receive a contract for £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by ass@@ uring clinical evidence as has been applied and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to contrac@@ eption from HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in which more than three decades lasting progress in tackling one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p when targeted at need@@ y and endangered people is offering the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiating with a partner which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now has to be carried out that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now as the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ health Department , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is short @-@ long delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by government welcome and over@@ due .
the evidence indicate how transforming this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected HIV , and that they will help to end the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living big life : mezzanine and clever designers have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , was smaller in 2014 from a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold their bags .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger area , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I sear@@ ched for something that was similar to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceil@@ ings .
I have fallen in love in her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square @-@ foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room house with a snow@@ bed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a tub storage room and mezzanine to make the generous cover height optim@@ ally .
&quot; I wanted high ceil@@ ings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my request , &quot; she says .
to this end , she commissioned the Architektur@@ - and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceil@@ ings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces with one another so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking in order to solve the award .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ worked out , without having to b@@ ade our heads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to attach the steel to it that he had the right height for the function above or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement created it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama .
for the mezzanine you can look down a classic cou@@ p@@ light window by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ or@@ ous living area .
gr@@ en@@ led gold furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne Ak@@ z@@ ente and vintage Serge Mou@@ ille covers the style of the program .
the use of spi@@ der plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to let him work longer .
in the kitchen the mirror just feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we have mir@@ ro@@ red units for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ or@@ bit space , the kitchen of the living room can complete the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a gar@@ rison .
&quot; a bit of engineering went into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced MD@@ F door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is in@@ significant , so that when you slide the door very easily , very easy . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win an additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or as your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate mak@@ ler will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which gain the space of the luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t de@@ ar@@ est you into the electric plu@@ gs in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ aph@@ ors from something standard into something quite admir@@ able .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
Brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar accounting .
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ ast@@ y , in a confrontation because of one of the biggest real estate imperi@@ alists Victoria in the worth of more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &quot; and developer Col@@ in De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business shall be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers were 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , accum@@ ulated , since the family has bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
West@@ co Je@@ ans founded the family West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail shops .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father he possesses Col@@ in - from Paul as the main operator and the dominant personality in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the corporate desire and Paul about one third .
jurisdiction that Col@@ onies is that Col@@ in property is in value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth more than 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in proposed resolutions with the left I held for the best properties he wrote in a first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last Friday , after several fail@@ ings took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul maintains that he excluded him .
Col@@ in arg@@ argu@@ ed that it was not true , it thro@@ ws Paul to manage some poss@@ essions .
in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to present the dispute .
&quot; my Italian inheritance writes , that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs are in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides covered by law firms .
Mrs De Lut@@ is and her husband &apos;s husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ at@@ oms from the late 1950 @-@ he bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the col@@ ing@@ wood @-@ property , opened in the Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 were hoping to pass her property to her sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is group , taking Col@@ in claimed that Mark during leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million have been paid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Luke and Mark are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept herself very , although he was a former AF@@ L member member and after a biography in 2015 from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lut@@ is and their attor@@ neys @-@ in contact .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case before the courts may be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to complain and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have awak@@ ened that Paul and I would be in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and imp@@ lied that he still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday the hope of this hope seemed to be past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved in the near future of the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
m@@ umps of new Stab@@ sch@@ ef is planning to restrict the media @-@ ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly could actually do .
if so , he will be the first one .
Polit@@ ico reports that the new staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the chef on a uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new staff of the White House , at his first working day , he arranged a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he wants to repair : poor information that has been into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to suffer tr@@ ump by monitoring its media so@@ ws .
President Tr@@ umps relationship to television dates back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong .
&quot; if Kan@@ did@@ at Tr@@ ump was up@@ set because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places to convince , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam Nun@@ berg in February opposite to Polit@@ ico .
Polit@@ icos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep on Twitter @-@ habit under control , according to six former elec@@ toral campaigns to ensure that his personal media con@@ sum a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these batt@@ agn@@ ate war@@ ts something that we did not know - that m@@ umps ets would have even more ign@@ ition without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets , the Tr@@ ump is not sent .
if his staff had made it a few times , anger from it , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has consistently prevented it , that Tr@@ ump &apos;s contro@@ vers@@ y is prov@@ oked .
a part of the problem lies in that the people in a white house that reli@@ es from competing parties , always try to bring their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that fo@@ sters their views from the world .
Polit@@ ico - quite busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultants , the president for the strategic grounds of the du@@ bi@@ ous information .
this was an example which was described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump and a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ ak , and that he is st@@ ressing to find out where these origin@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone had a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty head office in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of le@@ ak &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson had been banned from Twitter for Sch@@ ik@@ anen , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false acc@@ us@@ ations in the past and to re@@ voke them in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher imp@@ lied that the dam@@ ent Stab@@ sch@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that folded ?
Kelly attempts three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master @-@ sear@@ ched crimin@@ als get postal mail from Euro@@ pol

since 2016 , the website consists of www@@ .e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it was viewed .

travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ är@@ s @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some advent@@ uro@@ us travelers to war fu@@ ß , who have negotiated one of the congreg@@ ated dit@@ ch to back a field in front of their sovereig@@ n houses .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans in a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ ous series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transportation after they were exp@@ elled only in May without having been scr@@ apped by some of the advice of excav@@ ated dit@@ ch to prevent their accidents .
the tak@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and op@@ ted their vehicles by a section which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
fu@@ ri@@ ous residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it would be &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous residents said , &quot; You are moved there on Monday night after being sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they cast stones at the pas@@ sers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implementation in fact , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping a long under@@ statement to protect their parks .
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ bro@@ ok Road and I am not happy , continue to pay my com@@ promises if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
a local community that did not want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travellers to become lo@@ oted by another round .
the numbers have raised this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaking at the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp in the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ bro@@ ok Road and work with the police of Soli@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our speci@@ fying collection , it is very important that many residents to report anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court must check when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the T@@ ors of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently renovated and will be open again on March 1st next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the dam@@ al@@ ous ambience of the company mbH , the 13th of April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also recei@@ pts from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , given dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered to the building office as a collective accommodation , which cat@@ ered for contro@@ vers@@ y .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time .
however , above all the Freu@@ den@@ thal Ober@@ may@@ champion of Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious interest in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with senior management team Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in the bathroom Men@@ al@@ b .
they are hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been standing in front of the entrance , and if you step down the house will become clear , what extensive renov@@ ations will be carried out .
the so@@ ils were las@@ ered , blan@@ kets to part secluded , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ las .
the rooms are fitted with large walk showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there will be new windows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything was later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as express@@ ing Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are included in the facilities .
if one does not want to position on the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a up@@ scale city level , stresses more .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms want to set up wide , explains shar@@ k further .
both single vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with OB Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourismus@@ dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments in demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ on .
even the external installations are brought to the fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard a large terrace comes from the restaurant that is publicly available .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ äre : us @-@ Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler sets Grand Jury
in the Russia Aff@@ äre on US @-@ President Donald Tr@@ ump should have had a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
in recent weeks , the panel was recorded in the past weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; with appeal to the thing trusted people .
the paper promp@@ ted the step as a sign that mu@@ eller has extended its inquiries and intensified .
the CN@@ N &apos;s Sender reported it already provides first pre @-@ charge of the atro@@ cities related to a meeting between m@@ umps and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for longer , targeted in the presidential election in 2016 .
the study examined whether there were inter@@ pol@@ ls between the m@@ umps and Moscow authorities .
in the course of investigations , several men should stand in the elec@@ toral campaign as a advis@@ er to the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
therefore , Mu@@ eller also reported more and more m@@ umps priv@@ ates and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special dro@@ ple@@ t Tr@@ ump personally have been put into the centre and I seek to seek the ordin@@ ate if the president could hin@@ der the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide whether the indic@@ t@@ ment should be raised .
Grand Jur@@ ys will therefore also be called dock .
most of them , they will turn on when it comes to larger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be swit@@ ched by the Prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s office to pre @-@ charge individuals on the hearing .
according to the CN@@ N Sender , pre @-@ lad@@ ders were already exhibited , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked to have been asked about this statement in the report .
furthermore , they should provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also dre@@ ad@@ ors and father @-@ in son Jar@@ ed Kus@@ h@@ ner and his dam , Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in conversation with this .
legal expert told on Thursday nights in U.S. TV , that the entry show that mu@@ eller leave himself out of his work , and that he if it should be necessary to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end the end to decide about the survey of an indic@@ t@@ ment .
however , the entry of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums is the beginning of a new phase in the studies and a new reason for president Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening had a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia Aff@@ äre as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia @-@ history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject give the Democrats an opportunity to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good because they have nothing else to talk about what they can talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he know nothing about the sub@@ stitution of a Grand Jury .
but this work is usually in secret , he empha@@ sized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House feared all measures that acceler@@ ated the work of the special way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey said three times that will not be determined against the president .
one has no reason to suppose that something has changed , it did in the explanation .
but he had only been used after carrying Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey .
because of this re@@ vocation there were acc@@ us@@ ations against Tr@@ ump loud , he would want to hin@@ der the justice .
com@@ ey appeared in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump have asked him to adjust the inquiries against the then national security advis@@ or Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure because of the examination .
after presentation of US media , the White House gathered against the Sonder@@ ers and his associates .
the cle@@ ared spec@@ ulation about it whether tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to be released .
unlike an independent Sonder@@ investig@@ ator of the Congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the later returned , Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which it theoretically could be denied on ur@@ ging of the President of the judicial Ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to take one step forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic broad@@ ators put on Thursday , according to which the Sonder@@ ers could no longer be released so simply .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg is driving in the Antarc@@ tic
in the west @-@ Antarc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg was solved by the barely si@@ eben@@ mal size Ber@@ lins , from the Schel@@ &apos;s .

a danger for people does not go out of him .
on the climate change , climate change has played a role in the breaking @-@ up of the ic@@ eberg , is unclear for researchers .
however , since about 30 years there has been a series of un@@ common break@@ down@@ s of ice lines in the region , writes the US @-@ research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact @-@ reason background .

in addition , the ic@@ e@@ plate stand under tension and can dis@@ integrate , if at a key point a piece ab@@ bre@@ d .
the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float up on the water and put ice so much water as it results after the mel@@ ting itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the loss of the tur@@ f is leading to the glacier directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could possibly increase the level , but only in the low dimensions , writes the British research project to observe the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fei@@ s is home to the A@@ WI @-@ Datab@@ ase with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest con@@ val@@ ry of the Antarc@@ tic .
on the passing from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks up regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ e@@ tag comes in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y said from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; confirmed he also .
among scientists be controversi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ ves will now grow back and possibly collap@@ sing , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers can not withdraw the break@@ age of this gigantic ic@@ eberg not on climate change , so in the last decades many of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula are destroyed .
this long time the Antarc@@ tic is spreading to South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antarc@@ tic Sur@@ vey , the Ice surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has declined in the 19@@ 50s to 28 000 square kilometres .
to decline , the temperature increase has contributed .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has fallen in the past 50 years by around three degrees warmer and war@@ n in the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U want pets at the staff
because it is always harder to occupy freely @-@ ending places , the CD@@ U is calling out to step out of the Emplo@@ yers to be more attractive .
just shortly before the summer brake , the chal@@ k , 41 new places in the administration have passed through .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now we have 17 traine@@ es their first working day behind them .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very popular .
around 620 candidates were to be distinguished for the places this year .
nonetheless , the circle continues to further personnel to cope with the requirements and tasks .
currently there is still in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann as far as 50 did not occupy positions .
among other things doctors and engineers , and forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U would now want to take the initiative in the chal@@ k , together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is intended to work out by the desire of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recru@@ iting and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term tem@@ ples of specialists , but future @-@ oriented of the application cr@@ app@@ y means it is .
the overall concept should be guided both inside and outside , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ trade unions and a training scheme , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this already sounds a good approach .
because the circle has to do with staff problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition in public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees , the disease , illness or alter@@ ation due to the service .
so the highest time to action therefore , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter nations , Leader of the CD@@ U , is continuing beyond the joint request .
he attended long ago in the chal@@ k day for a f@@ ist surprise , when he placed the staff of personnel on question and the rest of the parties were aston@@ ished .
people would like to be ver@@ ified that all the options will be reviewed from the local Emplo@@ yers Federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are unable to come to a satisfying solution to the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the national towns - a pet plan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the CD@@ U is trying to pay for better employees and officials than it can actually fores@@ ee the public service for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money there is only when you change to a higher level , which are oriented to professi@@ ons .
however , the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established , where employees needed to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute .
last but not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ ktor Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone of NGOs @-@ migrants @-@ rescue
Italy has advised NGOs to rescue operations for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , war@@ ns that they are not allowed to continue , if they do not comply with new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not submit a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Minister of Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La st@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came a day after the Italian authorities det@@ ained a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; because their team had effectively mer@@ ged with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration .
the aid organisation that has been in use only for one year , refused to express themselves a detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian state of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains our top priority to rescue the human life . so we are very sorry to operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion about social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot determine all alleg@@ ations that are currently being raised , after we all have collected information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , monitors the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is assumed that his occupation of infl@@ atable migrants will be delivered on board , which can be delivered directly by people who can drive the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such a coincidence , just 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast was done , according to the Act of the Prosec@@ ut@@ or , the content of Italian media has been published .
the occupation is suspected , taking care of the authority of the Italian coastal guard , the bail@@ outs in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not by any other motives monitors .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have taken on board of all an Italian police officers who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been agreed to keep up the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Acti@@ va Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary but acceptable , since they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their bail@@ out actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nob@@ el@@ p@@ rei@@ sträger @-@ Organisation doctors are without limits ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i now said that the number of migrants arrived after the bail@@ out measures in Italy , have declined significantly in recent weeks , resulting in efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local citi@@ zenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries have been able to reach Europe .

console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga ge@@ ars for e @-@ sports
will the Sport @-@ Stars be sitting in the future before computer con@@ soles , instead of fighting with wind and weather across the stadium ?
fact : e @-@ sport is long ago a serious growing industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high places included .
this also recognized the first German lig@@ ament that is increasingly active in this field .
the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid @-@ July an E @-@ Sport department and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire all new young audi@@ ences to the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Chairman of the Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is certain that on these train it is still un@@ fortunate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the coming weekend , the Football World Association organized FIFA to London the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; in which the g@@ amer of different clubs will compete against each other .
besides counters and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
Robin Dut@@ t looks great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Wer@@ der Bremen is meanwhile advis@@ es an agency for virtual foot@@ ball@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to be in particular with the 14 to 30 years old , that young people still have to go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs sought to con@@ quer any possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present in these markets than once in the year to send South Asia to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
in the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Leg@@ ends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA on competition level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago , as in the normal sport , Li@@ gen is established , in which the professionals will compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in Asia @-@ Pacific , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport for sport ?
for many , the idea is safe to be used .
even Ingo F@@ rob@@ ous has long been faced with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Köln is E @-@ Sport a sport because it is compet@@ iti@@ vely and a lot of biological and physical reactions , which one can also find in classical sport - for example increased heart frequencies , hor@@ rend@@ itions , hor@@ monal changes .
besides , there are cogn@@ itive abilities , a technical and tacti@@ cal understanding and a quick responsi@@ veness .
professional g@@ amer should not only train to the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; fit@@ te player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping gets more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are hard to be carried out by online games , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport .
positive raises the scientists the high inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are internationally on the road , which is like a big global family , there are no inter @-@ cultural shirts .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte , and the association &apos;s Inter@@ active Ac@@ counting Software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , in order to be implemented in Germany 50 million euros , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
sales of 130 million are expected in three years .
against the barely 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors .
international are many countries already on .
large markets are Asia and the U.S. , where ex @-@ bass player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rod@@ rigu@@ ez take part in the US team N@@ RG es@@ ports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ashton Kut@@ cher invest@@ s in the e@@ Sport @-@ competition .
also in Europe a lot is doing .
in a Norwegian school e @-@ sport was introduced as a period , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ eine according to Dut@@ t have now been committed to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ged to Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ board of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nost@@ algia , to fall , and the old days to clear , is no longer sufficient .
it &apos;s about keeping the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time in the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ ised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means Dut@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is not enough to keep in mind that football remains everything as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the con@@ rad Roy on su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encourages her friend through lyrics and calls to su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to local currency .
Carter was condemned in June because of the per@@ me@@ able k@@ ill@@ ings of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ constitu@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
it was confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal officials argu@@ ed that both her and Mr Roy suffered from a psych@@ ic illness .
in red sh@@ orts and a cre@@ atic coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ facing eyes , when it was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have brought &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ or to the Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has not taken any responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown a rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that she is totally un@@ fortunate . &quot;
judges Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find that her &quot; alter or Reif@@ eg@@ rad , or even to have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ ut@@ or read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is &quot; no day in whom I &apos;m not going to ro@@ ver the loss of my beloved Son .
I want he to be proud of me and how I am going with everything . I try , despite all of my pain , that we will carry with us for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it in .
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ ot@@ n Roy , said that she will never be pursued by the realization that she will never be taking part in the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; no longer this only person to have with whom I was together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life . &quot; she said .
the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ent as there is no law in Massachusetts where there is no crime to raise oneself against a crime to commit su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon e@@ oxide in a vehicle in 2014 .
the fall drew attention to national attention after Car@@ ters &apos;s texts , reve@@ aling that she encourages him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Han@@ g you , spring of a building , create you yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she sent in two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment of his su@@ icide she wrote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All that you have to do is set the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ord@@ ain that she would benefit from the event by some press .
the case has the legal opinion shared .
among the few , the Carter def@@ ective , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was condemned in 2007 because of the murder of their British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted on two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria captain .

so who was chosen to compete in Lah@@ m , a small extra @-@ motivation can only be done well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what you want as a player wants to take on responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
at the right behind , this is his position , the white t@@ amp@@ on on the arm did their rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i can in this start @-@ formation like the one who can take the best into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the in@@ hib@@ ited trou@@ pe .

Rud@@ y for example , in the cat@@ acom@@ bs not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i passed after a couple of cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard about an interesting phrase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you just need to win every game in Bavaria . &quot;
after all , he does not have to bring the new one more .

it often set itself irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ably , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic leader in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than one year in which the new economic sm@@ ister Volker W@@ iss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank N@@ atus , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ ves ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ iss@@ ing attacks the wishes of the economy to blocked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lem@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Audi will change 85@@ 0,000 diesel cars - car manufacturers face themselves with a bac@@ kl@@ ash
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW @-@ chair said , the company was the opinion that &quot; there are intelligent options as road restrictions , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or restrict .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of car manufacturers , plants for neutr@@ alising the rep@@ lic@@ ability of diesel cars , take also to what it makes difficult to hold the price of cars more competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indic@@ ted to ign@@ oring the powerful car firms and ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions when a car was tested , but when normal driving conditions has been with@@ drawn .
in the United States several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former leader of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and therefore is not protected from delivery and could be brought to trial in the United States .
at the beginning of this year Audi was included in German criminal investigation by Volkswagen , after the authorities to have accused the system installed to handle the emissions rules in Europe and a request which focused on the United States has been extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi in the study could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : the luxury car manufacturers will bear in proportion to the profit of Volkswagen at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was temporarily one of the most widely published Car@@ to@@ on @-@ carto@@ onists , the cel@@ lists of his figures are its hall@@ mark .
also with 85 the Argentin@@ ian paints still lives and works in a film .
his message : lau@@ gh , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he called himself as an artist for lucky cards - which makes him frustr@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
following stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960 &apos;s break : with the release of his Car@@ to@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
again and again the artists of cities inspire .
large , rund@@ own Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures are in drawings with the slide Tower from Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , his own references is still alive today , working daily almost ten hours .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush animals and watches are showing its d@@ rol@@ ish figures to continue spreading throughout the world .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los favorite animal in its drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ s@@ s@@ ler as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures are speaking in the 3D movie , which is to 2019 in the film wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script is not written by him .
this is why it works rather on the TV series , which is produced , as its original labels , which is produced .
lav@@ ender from Provence on climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to the lack of d@@ rought remin@@ ding conditions and because of illness con@@ fer@@ ing insects , resulting from scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian institutions CRI@@ E@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change during the past years , and in the autumn much more .
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small cement , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ gon@@ ads , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
lav@@ ender oil is not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very high for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of having very long vegetable watches with a large number of flowers we have smaller , COMP@@ ENT@@ W@@ IC@@ KEL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of burning out of the ground , but also the b@@ lowing of plants with a protective mix of tone and water and the development of sorts , which are resi@@ li@@ ent over dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town@@ house Ge@@ isa in the th@@ ür@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n celeb@@ rates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
this Saturday and Sunday take a poster on this Saturday and Sunday .
cr@@ ates , bra@@ ins , tra@@ ders , vag@@ ants or a land area , should be experienced in the downtown these days .
the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt official and ceas@@ eless drug application .
but this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
it has been told to them that it is important to change its routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is safe to feel secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office which were the target of an attack with gran@@ ulates or leave them at home .
safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ ality , allies .
you ask the re@@ por@@ ters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and ab@@ dom@@ inal tract .
there are drug ad@@ dictions , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the pav@@ ement of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest break from violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are more and more journalists have taken place at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 took office . 5@@ 89 are following attacks and threats under Bundes@@ schutz und till now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries .
among the latter there is a publisher and its inspir@@ er from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .
its absence will be deeply perceived as his presence everywhere is present - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his Middle @-@ finger here with the word &quot; Justice &quot; on the front@@ age of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts who show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panam@@ era .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss about their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , Par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 has been er@@ ected a Son@@ der &apos;s Office , in order to edit the cases of journalists , it has led to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murder , which are associated every year with drug @-@ drug and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed in court .
with Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are im@@ pris@@ oned and even though the terrain is still tra@@ itor@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting to discussion of security is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why mis@@ str@@ ust we all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of the 15th of May Val@@ dez has left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ ol@@ la was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot onto him , pres@@ um@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with the &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the cap drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to travel freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s imprisonment last year and the delivery into the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloody crimes of the country , as ri@@ val@@ ing fac@@ tions are struggling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of bran@@ ded , two @-@ story mouse @-@ een for drug @-@ men , which are larger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Boy@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder of murder .
first , in February the publication of a interviews with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alled cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this announcement may have anno@@ yed the sons , pres@@ um@@ ably v@@ ans bought each copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to time period .
the second fault was to force Val@@ dez not to comp@@ el after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had released the same story to leave the country towards its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived his friends and colleagues that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues to the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without having to encounter the sm@@ ote problem , &quot; said Ka@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
in time the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and revenue and advertising took .
they loved to publish hard fi@@ red investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were cap@@ tiv@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories , which nobody else could treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she was awarded the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez presented the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they go .
he gave voluntarily to him that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October .
&quot; you need to take the task of falling as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was like a long@@ sho@@ re@@ ous , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survived .
you trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his guard .
he would always sink to El Guay@@ abo , the bar towards the office , and always sit down at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for the routine be his destruction ?
his death has also comp@@ elled them to ask their own assump@@ tions about how they do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and cross @-@ roads to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Ka@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ toler@@ ances and self @-@ employment .
rely on his own instin@@ cts .
if it smells , keep away from it .
the trouble is , said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt governmental bodies at home .
the landscape changes continuously .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for the safety training , were suddenly no mobile phones . days ago became known that sp@@ y@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments to be used for monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were examined in front of the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government , the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ sto@@ rey building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porter asked if this officers came to the 50 per cent of polic@@ emen , who referred to the govern@@ or itself as not trusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ porter went into the mountain country where the drugs of drugs are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has led to three main stories .
there was ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , focused on the hom@@ etown of the govern@@ or .
and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the state of state embr@@ ac@@ ing .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so that caution was offered , when it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug tra@@ ders and authorities .
a por@@ ters from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who belonged to the ruling institution@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost all the century all political levels .
recently several Pr@@ i @-@ Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ure were accused of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the re@@ porter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this e@@ at@@ ery , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man had escap@@ ed a military attack .
only a few months ago , readers would have seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender post@@ ature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez became a storage room for signs and stick@@ ers that protest against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the associates have become something they could never expect : activists in the name of the press .
in the next morning rep@@ or@@ ian Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez schn@@ app@@ alled a few characters and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the state .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
throughout the country journalists have become more voc@@ ative by written in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on hearing and construction .
on that day the director of Bo@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to express journalists and release them because they have said the truth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has since then asked that it is divided by the government once again because it is concerned that their anger has been viol@@ ated their objecti@@ vity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , part of the government officials and of a equally valid society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters will not only be killed by drugs and security , but also on the organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; artists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists and officials in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want to sne@@ ak the mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ top@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was alle@@ ged@@ ly signed by the Z@@ etas Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer @-@ tast@@ ers and ear@@ phones positioned next to their separate head .
some stores have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Miros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how it did El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo in 2004 after ass@@ ass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly directed the drug card with an editorial page on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are f@@ lown out of their homeland or even from the country .
it is a painful choice .
it &apos;s hard to find jobs in exile and they still observe the roads and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased as apparently the photographer of Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was ass@@ ass@@ inated with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who keep left and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives to that the drug store scar@@ es him .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and therefore I re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce began at the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , than once all their phones started .
a number of found@@ ries with band@@ rebel@@ lion and security gu@@ ards in the vicinity of the resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war escal@@ ated , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell Emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ sor edge , they have published the news on the site of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the cover side had to be changed next day .
Sir@@ s he@@ aps close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ ik@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a view of the polic@@ emen , the che@@ ache , to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid of all , they did not show it .
among the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to completely Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to its traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think of it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bu@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day , for the Javier mur@@ dered , the traine@@ eship asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used to so@@ ften its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , even though a terri@@ fying .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nas@@ horn of a Canadian Berg@@ labor@@ ers were so well received , that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even realize that its created skin of red@@ dish brown was - and they said they could have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referred to it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs items in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered kind of N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preser@@ v@@ ated state has researchers who express it as &quot; really remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the cor@@ p@@ c@@ ated her@@ bi@@ osis is the best survi@@ ving Fos@@ sil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something , which was out of the surrounding rocks at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to see more accurately .
the Fos@@ sil discovered by him Fos@@ sil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy stra@@ w@@ elling .
after all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you just flas@@ hed a little with the eyes , you might almost believe it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs items - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ fres@@ ser , although he is covered with an arm@@ chair and resem@@ ble a conver@@ tible arm@@ or , probably threatened by meat @-@ vo@@ res din@@ osau@@ r .
the strong ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technology that is known as a counter coating , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to ming@@ le better in his surroundings and to do@@ ve his enemies , saying , what suggests that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs visited head@@ lines in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and it was called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta and mit@@ ch@@ elli following the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of the team who spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours of it , to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specim@@ en made it possible by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of sc@@ ales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the confrontation , a widespread def@@ ect method in the beast , which means that the top of the cre@@ ature dar@@ ker was dar@@ ker than its sub@@ side .
although the confrontation is usual , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta falls far from the animals living today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs of enough pressure due to meat @-@ res din@@ osau@@ rs was urged that the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who use the con@@ quer@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or gir@@ dles - are much smaller and hur@@ t@@ ful than prey , what sign@@ aled that this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong beast @-@ behavior on a massive , strongly crus@@ hed din@@ osau@@ rs , how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs mal@@ ign@@ ant have been to be , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sc@@ ales shows that the skin of the sl@@ al@@ e. red @-@ brown was .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on references to his life , including its preserved Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs while he died , driven into a river and driven into the sea , where he s@@ ank on the back to the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern h@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conservative daily skin , but also in three dimensions remains preserved and the original form of the animal is attached , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal looks almost as much as it is in the early chal@@ k period .
you do not need much imagination to use it to re@@ construct . if you just have a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k period was a time , as huge ther@@ op@@ ods , fl@@ esh@@ y din@@ osau@@ r , which stood on two legs , the earth crossed .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the bre@@ aded din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by some of his terrible ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy mon@@ ster .
the scientists , their latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta after the death in the sea and in mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fies .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near the Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the best@@ seller @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the Schn@@ au@@ ze up to the hips .
the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops that rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red crop has been w@@ em@@ med by the Western Canada , until a flood@@ ed river flood@@ ed into the open sea .
but the underwater ill@@ ings of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ ament in an exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this particular specim@@ en are so well preserved , that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste still b@@ aked with b@@ ump@@ y sw@@ amps along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I accum@@ ulator , the conf@@ using it becomes .
ri@@ fied rests of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y mo@@ cks , which carry the skull of the animal .

in the storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many last
violent accident on Thursday nights at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass strike .
there are numerous Ver@@ sions , kilometres long standing - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday afternoon at a Mass@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age at about 20 people have been wo@@ unded .
according to the first statements of the police were at 17.00 hours between the connection , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm under 30 vehicles , among them probably also lor@@ ry , in@@ doors .
at the exact number of the last documents , no information is provided .
it handle light to middle @-@ heavy injury , said a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher .
a big b@@ ann@@ ot of lif@@ egu@@ ards had been an in@@ genu@@ ity .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction to Munich .
in the Munich press , there was about ten kilometres long reg@@ ression .
like an AZ re@@ porter , it also came on the return to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade not@@ ched the label of the vehicles that now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. the second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car @-@ car spor@@ ter and a passenger .
a SAR helic@@ opter was on the road to the in@@ genu@@ ity .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing is sens@@ ing sitting in the train and as@@ le@@ ep .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just got in@@ geni@@ ous thoughts .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens an uns@@ us@@ ft , or h@@ itting the driver in the middle of the work@@ flow .
box @-@ control @-@ control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the German rail@@ ways currently has the endless vehicle control .
one simply confirms the mobile phone that you have taken his place and de@@ valu@@ ated the ticket .
currently , a test run on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will probably be available in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; said a train spokes@@ man .
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the rail@@ road de@@ valu@@ ation with no creator .
in order to use this , however , some conditions must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to make a online ticket - which is already the most passengers to do .
you also have to have bought it via the app of the rail , the DB Navigator , what is the most convenient type of ticket booking .
and last you need a seat reservations .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : one climb@@ s to the train , calling its map under &quot; My tickets . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Test@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then a button on electronic de@@ valu@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Zug@@ oner receive a message on their mobile devices that bicycles X is located on the train and taken the ge@@ booked seat .
comes the pull @-@ companion in the chassis box at Platz Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already ent@@ valuable online ticket .
so you can continue to continue , keep on keeping .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which again should use the passengers .
&quot; who relax@@ es you want to travel without ticket control by our att@@ endant personnel , checked out in the DB area simply by yourself .
this allows the passengers to make their travel time on the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Board of DB correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those often railway drives , knows that in addition to delays and pas@@ sover , the vehicle @-@ roll@@ ers are among the biggest nu@@ is@@ ies .
for many times , one does not have any documents , but in each case one of the founders did not include all documents that you need to de@@ valu@@ ation on online tickets .
either the credit card or the registration card or otherwise a document you must show .
the result are endless discussions between mig@@ rate and riding lessons , resulting in a bad mood in the section or large space and delays in control of their own tickets and take the creator at the end time takes care of other concerns .
only a small number of test@@ customers can use the new service .
and also the services ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .

how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken as far as their core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis lived on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a mail from someone from the high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child and it still lies on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was called there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else posted on her feed , she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was continually released on their tim@@ eline ret@@ we@@ et@@ et .
the rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lively body that was stretched on the road and staying there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at himself .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put their mobile phone to return later in the evening twe@@ ets over people on the can@@ field drive .
there were photos of police band and people , cr@@ ying , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live @-@ feed in which a polic@@ eman from a group of demonstr@@ ators with a rebel@@ li@@ ous dog was standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said that another police officer his ri@@ f@@ le and cri@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered fer@@ rell with her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to ourselves and which we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this moment I felt sh@@ aking mer@@ ry .
I was angry and cr@@ ying . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and the protest , of love and loss , the strength and resistance of resistance which live from the perspective of people , who live in the community and have filled the streets to answer responses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell with her daughter who carried a flower gar@@ ment and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , bes@@ po@@ ke the two a conversation , which she had countless occasions in this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
they have to know it and it must be seen and raised in it .
it must be well developed not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves .
even though I have the happiness to give her an experience in which they personally have no e@@ kl@@ ess racism then it is no different than the next black women child .
I feel I would prove it a bad service to keep it away from it . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was a camp@@ ground , when the activists was awaiting the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly started to take a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has changed after 9 August totally , &quot; she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Miss@@ ouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health qualities in black communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question came out of Fer@@ rell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can explo@@ it ? &quot;
this skep@@ ti@@ cism became nour@@ ished by inn@@ um@@ erable cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and its resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , their votes have not been centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ ils .
his commitment brought the project closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years to Brow@@ n@@ ism .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are shown , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community which comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open guest in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show &quot; surprising personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s life as she likes to love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls has repeatedly repe@@ ating the role of the black gay women in the wider black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black Teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media than sw@@ ul .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must carry the main last of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agre@@ es to remark that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is kept alive by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is no affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Fer@@ rell was chosen due to their identity as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who raised this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the fore@@ front , because in a life there is so much on these cross as a black , sul@@ ph@@ ule woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the communication era in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long since disappeared , but the racial links between the municipality and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ ade of a highway on a demonstration .
it describes the social @-@ policy atmosphere of the area that it calls their homes : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
nevertheless she felt obliged to a ch@@ ant and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the road three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose but besides our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sizes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves the people , although they are still not built for a long time .
but the idea of a mall in the south @-@ part of the pedestrian zone started since the first presentation 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to say to the bit gallery : &quot; this would be a dream ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be genuine class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ing ) or simply plain : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates are building that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which also the rest of business will benefit , the opponents , that then the pedestrian zone are ble@@ eding .
add to : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , where the market hall stand , in which 13 Direct to offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be the conclusion .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - and a Bed@@ a @-@ place for the possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been doing almost twice a week in the farm market for many years .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the tap@@ es are always very happy .
even the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and above all , after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer u@@ pri@@ ght .
there is also this in other cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether a direct mark@@ er in a market hall in the gallery , comes at the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it might not be too low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping is in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , shoes , threats or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are plenty of it in our city .
one can see how many shop@@ ke@@ e@@ dies are here empty - some have been here for months and years .
since there is not even a proper weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least keep up the market hall .
because after all , the goods offered is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive .
as you can see , cargo transactions will be located at a shopping center only by larger companies , because the dor@@ ms are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad there are almost no more and what is left of it will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a mall with a market hall is not suitable for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
mainly : where is the farm@@ market during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery does actually happen .
or creates it a bit @-@ gallery to exp@@ el all business from bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and a shopping center , which stands blank , doesn &apos;t need any one .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but there is no place for a peasant hall , thanks to the sore , many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg , there is no place more .
when the farmers market hall is made , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portrait of Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the center of the space of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which hang almost in@@ vari@@ ably similar to cables by the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist &apos;s He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair sections that were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Kno@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st did a 35 years imprisonment , after it made a secret diplomatic messages about the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , which opened on August 2 , is said to be A Bec@@ oming Us@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg who built their discipline compet@@ ency in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman , and landmark , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his post .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was created by the algorithms , created by Mann@@ ing extracts and made out of 30 portraits , as anyone with these genetic data could look a sharp , even though some intellectual comment may not only be related to the formation of DNA data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inherent det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already talked openly about the identification as a woman , was sentenced to 2013 because of 20 acc@@ us@@ ations , including six bre@@ aches of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison its picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gr@@ ati@@ ous , black @-@ white Self@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is clearly uncomfortable at a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ ine bl@@ onde carries - with which it was associated with .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
it produced the artist &apos;s portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts like cigar@@ ettes and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a time period .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not see at that time and she could not get photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea , asking her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and their det@@ ained M@@ use became un@@ equal eu@@ ph@@ re@@ es , which have inter@@ change@@ over several years over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Com@@ ic &quot; supplements &quot; who fores@@ aw a future in which the president does not convert his opinion , and it would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama actually only had a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing liberation for seven brutal years in a military court in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happ@@ i@@ ction .
there is also a difference in the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ ke , because Donald Tr@@ ump will lead a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to rec@@ ti@@ fying new , twe@@ ed paths that he should actually fix , further di@@ agrams .
when De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all of these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery the written artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with its over@@ big sub@@ ordin@@ ance , including ( the &quot; i &quot; in their sur@@ name is equipped with a heart ) an end to the automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of C@@ s and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , such as amazing , at least in biological sense , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will say about it is that our gen@@ ome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own space is a page from the above com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it emerg@@ es with a friend pre@@ stige in the hand from the discipl@@ in@@ ark@@ ets of the United States such as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they represent your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly out of a letter that she wrote me , &quot; said the artist Gre@@ etings from Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get to go@@ ose ge@@ ese if I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition in personally - just as it was pres@@ umed in the Com@@ ic book , but when it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room , by its own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulators , who collap@@ sing itself like hor@@ des of demonstr@@ ators .
that was also purpos@@ eful how everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where her genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ ack has been written with Pen@@ cil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it feels like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also stuck behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford because of killing
a nation@@ wide crowd @-@ hunting is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff at Oxford University which were sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been taken in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal inju@@ ries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) ar@@ rest warran@@ t because of their alle@@ ged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , like the acts of the Local Court of C@@ ook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
a collabor@@ ative part of the police agency of Chicago published war@@ n system states that the bodies were discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim to several bre@@ aches of his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained at the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective exam@@ ines the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police were actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them has been extraordinary professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement , that La@@ them should now be evaluated and excluded from the passing of the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a minor issue that is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ en@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the U.S. military authorities in any concei@@ vable manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want he set himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said , he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of their stay , and our efforts to locate them intensi@@ fy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and war@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria in the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ ADA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the cur@@ ri@@ culum R@@ US@@ ADA receive the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the W@@ ada roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM ann@@ ot@@ ted the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to comply with the code which describes the criteria for re@@ placing R@@ US@@ ADA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing that could cause for Russia to concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria listed in the list cited , however , that the Russian Anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities have to publicly accept the results of the W@@ ada approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer , Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren , to publicly accept national sponsored by the Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conduct the investigation because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has collap@@ sed a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no State programmes and we will not admit anything that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ual words tun@@ ed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the manager of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian Sales Point R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov issues related to the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversi@@ al positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ ADA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the execution of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after visiting the main qu@@ arti@@ ers of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Bi@@ direc@@ tional Olivier Nig@@ gli that R@@ US@@ ADA move in the right direction &quot; moved back to become again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - gri@@ eved .
and even if you talked an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not ask the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objecti@@ vity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has brought people from outside to help .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is the w@@ ax@@ ing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables businesses to conduct surveys , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint @-@ hot@@ lines , and in some cases des@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , allow the C @-@ Suite managers to deal with and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as pen@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up Gl@@ int , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel with gl@@ int in the three years .
in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of particular teams , it provides a heat card of the company that have at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low access results - so that you can im@@ pose in why .
companies come to note that at the fore@@ front of the workplace will have to remain so that you won &apos;t get involved in sc@@ and@@ als who have been involved in sc@@ and@@ ale , since then a former employee has published an blog post , where those who have spoken , pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups such as Gl@@ int , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , according to the finan@@ z@@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize poor behavior , saw a rising interest and activity early this year among the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ pot@@ re@@ dit .
conver@@ tible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as Gl@@ int , lets Conver@@ ting companies tailor @-@ made &quot; powder &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and see the warmth of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS @-@ line , with the staff to report the bad behavior .
and when the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that its staff is badly treated or uns@@ eth@@ ically , it may be costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , worker @-@ fluctu@@ ation and pl@@ agues , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has conver@@ tible up for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company central , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good opportunity to track the complaints from employees .
now , as the company conver@@ ts itself , problems that were previously identified by ex@@ ecutives , who were hi@@ red in offices in cities or states - like discrimination , har@@ as@@ sment or un@@ associated pract@@ ition@@ ers - faster and appro@@ ached .
&quot; I can get closer to these holistic , 360 degree views in experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in front of employment and lit@@ igation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company started to take ethics , ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to her right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both gl@@ int and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and strain the companies with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , which support both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February like Sap@@ ph@@ ire vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital with which the entire capital has been raised to $ 47 million .
we won $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is an increasing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high col@@ der and interesting projects only in@@ serts .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work that you do , then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Linked@@ In that has both Conver@@ ting and Gl@@ int .
investors achieve ad@@ mitt@@ edly , if their portfolio companies are well run . companies run well when employees are working and involved .
if the analytics tools third parties promise , commitment and commitment to employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement with the experts of the workplace @-@ culture is important .
but data is useless if the administrator of a company take no action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that changes on the way is .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments come out and motiv@@ ate you .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to have been willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company very much to rely on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow staff members , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whom you do not take care of why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who is now performing monthly employees working now , was able to initi@@ ate actions on the same day when a problem above Gl@@ int is reported so deli@@ ver@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company gets always new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better relationship of workers in a branch that is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the break@@ down
it is up on 23 PM when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ b@@ umps and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these indi@@ an minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are log@@ ged to the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final testing before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ach@@ mill , &quot; said bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday was on Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and she has extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA were starting at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock , in order to be able to meet the players already packed .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the break postpon@@ ed almost a week after the last season and during the summer school , during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood was practical exercises .
in the course of August 18 exercises should hold off in the course of August 18 . 20 before the beginning of the formal playing preparations for their pre@@ l@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the control of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add the multip@@ lied routes of the players to another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we place this enormous burden three or four days on her and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it down , they plac@@ e. more , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is subjected to the clear sight@@ ings of its fields from an ad@@ joining parking and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been shed with pe@@ dic@@ s , which will be a protective net behind a door@@ posts , no easy task .
brother to occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a ad@@ mits that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room and then set it up there .
if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and from an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces over there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles on fac@@ tion aud@@ itor of third parties and show their results under the original contribution then , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will commen@@ ce with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible mis@@ gen@@ cies and to send them to the Fac@@ il@@ test , which may be displayed results of the initial examination from the original article .
Facebook was crit@@ ici@@ zed as one of the leaders in the so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of whom believe that it will also affect the US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe where French voters have been flood@@ ed in May through the wrong stories , and Germany will support a plan where social media networks should be pun@@ ished , if they do not manage to remove h@@ ated mail@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook appeared in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review .
&quot; in addition to the cogn@@ ition , which stories of fac@@ tions aud@@ ited un@@ aud@@ ited parties want to meet people more context in order to make well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product @-@ news on a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to be &quot; test &quot; in connection with the article , and working on other changes to his news feed to l@@ essen false news .
creating a com@@ ic @-@ Romans : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the Little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a si@@ lo@@ p for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ er .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley and is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manus@@ cript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says gre@@ ener .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; embr@@ aced the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos;@@ Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos;s , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected .
&quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b on the side of a letter that has been written by a double @-@ du@@ cks in the 1700 @-@ er years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
and letters always cra@@ w@@ l after smoke ; for then they ign@@ ed a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself also were .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is be@@ aten up with old papers that he is supported by National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I made my welcome gru@@ eling a little over @-@ rated &quot; ) this seems to be true .
Rhodes spent his days in exploring the vi@@ kt@@ ian &quot; new &quot; lock &quot; to watch the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ os@@ han heads at the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he hi@@ ked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and said with land travel , gar@@ dener , and sometimes also with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book .
then , at night tran@@ k he &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was first received in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes hit a decade later , the employee just began to take care of the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , &quot; it sho@@ ok on the loft .
Tag@@ eb@@ ücher , letters from the time of English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps showing what poss@@ essed : &quot; one could mean that land conf@@ lic@@ ed would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ke in order to have fought two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his gang ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on the English history including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who built the newly built castle to join the farm in order to join the farm from 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle in this book called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the farm was started in this area and I thought , a insur@@ rection is a good start .
maybe the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ ers who hid the family Dar@@ rell for seven years during the English Re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur is depic@@ ted in the 18th century , who filled his own bu@@ rial by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rhodes &apos;s family family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be enough to spend time and spend money on things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dar@@ rell @-@ men hol@@ sts their shoulder @-@ evidence by making rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rhodes is searching for another unique writer experiences .
he has caught a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a plumbing from the early 20th century , which has since then returned from nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the envel@@ ope of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef is started on Friday their campaign to introduce a new roof @-@ brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
still Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to hold the logo and the slogan for Nelson Art@@ z .
in the end of August it is supposed to be the highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on the post@@ ers at the Rh@@ en@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really think , write them on their yesterday un@@ activated website .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and in order to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we believe that we as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know the beauty and attr@@ acti@@ veness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the action it is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says furthermore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is to form@@ ulate a all@@ form@@ ative promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able all @-@ height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she stand in competition with other municipalities .
the large five @-@ dig@@ it amount will be the city by Bad Honnef its new umbrella @-@ brand and the campaign .
military forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ afraid of the Army
every year in early August in Ankara of the Upper Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on retirement and carriage in officer .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but nothing is routine by the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the session did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but the official residence of the Prime Minister .
at the deliber@@ ations , under the presidency of the Government , the five vi@@ zep@@ pel@@ in , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs participated .
in this way , civilians were in the Y@@ as in the world .
the government moves to the military in the military .
President Hul@@ usi acc@@ ar remain in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the a@@ erial forces and the Navy have been ab@@ sent .
since the failed coup , President Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als were spot@@ ted .
about 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alle@@ ged connections to the movement of Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire drawing of the put@@ sch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 individuals who have been directly involved in Putin &apos;s trial , is being negotiated in Ankara in this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gives him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an on the army really under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ beh@@ agen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , there are concerns about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , who among other things manifest@@ ed in the abolition of the head@@ tu@@ ous message for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
at least the great cleaning of the army and the safety gu@@ ards goes on .
in the middle of July Erd@@ og@@ an passed by Dec@@ ree additional 73@@ 95 citi@@ zenship , including 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 54@@ 6 soldiers .
it seemed like have Erd@@ og@@ an the military war@@ med .
the gener@@ als are formerly known as the actual lords of the country .
three times they as@@ ymp@@ h at appeal to their role as a gu@@ ardian of the world@@ ly state organisation .
after his election in 2002 Erd@@ og@@ an sup@@ planted the power of the military &apos;s step by step , not least among the appeal of the reform of the European Union .
former officers , Erd@@ og@@ an is specifically targeted by the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ mentioned officer , who sought after Putin &apos;s trial out of fear of persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
if this makes sense , such a development could not be cold .
in any case , there is no doubt about the alliance for ac@@ idity , doubts about the operational read@@ iness of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he looks to lower the legal immigrants to 5@@ 0,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulation on visa for a temporary working permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way the citizens from other countries Green Cards will be issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show understanding that our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
Ministry wants distance for racing
over the last few months the race of the race track has been controversi@@ al - now it is going to be quite fast .
even before the end of the year it is scheduled to be built on the long trail , on which the tourist train de@@ parts to be built .
in order to ensure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the transport of the ministry , we should start working on the track in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and san@@ itation the route of Il@@ men@@ au @-@ racing , the country is especially important for tourism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared transportation by Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling the route is about 2.5 million euros .
from this amount the country take 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country , will definitely be final , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as a operator was already agreed over the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the timetable that the vehicles and quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus to be ordered the rac@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle in December 2017 .
the Rac@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is one of the popular rail links between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot operating in the course of a pilot operating system , it has been used by a lot of people in the course of time to order it into a regular basis in the future .
the track is also in parts di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robot@@ ic is real and we should worry
just as you thought it won &apos;t be even crazy here , a new report comes across technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) has a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emerg@@ ent professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take her rise seriously .
customers can choose the ey@@ ec@@ es of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of F@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make them funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will get them much more frequent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex lips have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robot@@ ic with a sili@@ cone cor@@ nea , which feels warm to the touch - with deliber@@ ately human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can adapt his robots according to his beliefs &quot; and thereby select everything from the ey@@ ec@@ es of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples until the guy or the color of his fingers .
but it is still wor@@ rying since many robots own the &quot; personalities &quot; that would be a step@@ ping @-@ woman progressive .
modern Sexy lips have developed to robot@@ ic with a sili@@ cone cor@@ nea .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot makes it an example of its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they find respon@@ sive as such as rel@@ ap@@ ing .
and then there are still the True Compan@@ ion developed ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots with pre @-@ programm@@ ed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of rel@@ ap@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they may , what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you like , etc .
in the course of the day her m@@ oods had - all like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it may be tired of fix@@ ing on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are lots of distur@@ bing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ ver@@ sive female properties , rec@@ itation on rape if one passes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resi@@ des ) Far@@ rah , be@@ e@@ at@@ edly a most .
on his website ad@@ orable True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , why do men do not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the site .
however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or just merely another sex toy .
her emergence and increased refin@@ ement point out a bit dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course hold no sex robot , while the FR@@ R re@@ jects its growing popularity , they are still temporary on the edge of consumption .
but what out of the edge @-@ zones can be sick@@ ened , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or off@@ ended up until them there is free market for permission .
there is a certain evidence that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time in which the rights of women are threatened , in which in the White House there is a president who has been pra@@ h@@ ated to have women sexually attacked .
the ab@@ omin@@ ous aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the continuous body and the pronounced eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robot@@ ics is to make physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their buil@@ ders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point when it comes to her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot be separate or just away from their companions .
you do not have a mediation or a background history , nothing that hin@@ ts on independence or anything that could inter@@ f@@ ere the fantasy of dead submission .
other words expressed : they are counter@@ f@@ ful slaves .
or to express it in the speech by 2017 : Official n@@ anny
wearing Big Performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human sense .
it has become a bin@@ sen@@ heit of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , who have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. voters , even families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and harvest feast , there were newspaper in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump of sel@@ ter@@ mination .
we are all supp@@ os@@ edly supposed to leave our fil@@ tering .
it has been less noticed the power tr@@ umps , families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ ine , a left @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows she knows , including the Republi@@ can Rel@@ ief , who fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite pecu@@ liar on the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it anno@@ yed me in another context that this will also bring significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump but the kid@@ ding effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and cl@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ac@@ ulous possibility that our mothers of a day do not come across more .
however , there is a still start@@ ling long @-@ time scenario , in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; that suddenly appear to its standards as a beg@@ riff of denial .
I find myself today by an active nost@@ algia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the exp@@ ire - the dog on the au@@ d@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return saw ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact proves to be very mild crime .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next can@@ did@@ at of the Republi@@ can only be mentally to qualify as imm@@ eas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ ins in the city was , we brought our children to the Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ uss@@ ell &apos;s New Yorker &apos;s car department , and the top three dollars to spend in town if there is no caffeine needed .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cy@@ lin@@ ders - all cl@@ owns , are sp@@ elled and the animals rot@@ ate to look full of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the col@@ lim@@ ming music con@@ veys this in a notable way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines will become familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
five @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the topics pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience , as here two years old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women can go to it in the 40 @-@ years and have all had a great time .
if I could have liked the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it .
on the other hand , I was comp@@ elled to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before checking my credit card .
in the Coffee @-@ House on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % grat@@ u@@ ity - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but exer@@ ting pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olog@@ ised , while I was tired the experience made to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us p@@ ains the pain in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to the hospital for treatment of car@@ riages , which he suffered the pris@@ oner authorities after a fall in his cell .
pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned to one appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors for one appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors for one appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he k@@ ed ste@@ am@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by giving them several times a door of the toil@@ et@@ ab@@ ine in his house in Pre@@ toria on her .
pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to nomin@@ ate this time against the six @-@ year @-@ old sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , from which they say they be too sigh@@ ted .
the National Criminal Tribunal for the prosec@@ ution said that they will be charged with the Supreme Court of Justice of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection can be heard this year .
pist@@ ori@@ us runs risk that his sentence increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers now need to know
how exactly does the software update will take place ?
need to participate in the action in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in a nut@@ shell :
at the diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5,@@ 3 million cars .
you are supposed to improve the emissions of vehicles of em@@ ission classes 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin vom ACE Auto Club Europa are showing ratings :
is the new action compul@@ sory ?
no , the trad@@ ed software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory update previously apply only for cars , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fit has arranged the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when are clients informed about updates ?
the makers have announced an extraordinary implementation in the next few months , but is not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has told to write any person concerned .
if any case is an inspection , this will be done in its frame .
how long should the equipment go over altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ ana .
the relationships of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen voluntarily , the automobile manufacturers are dealing with the theme of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the equipment itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could it be to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE divi@@ des to the disp@@ atch .
probably foreign manufacturers would under@@ go , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is now a massive prize @-@ loss of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but even in the regions where driving bot@@ e .

we make the town worth living
roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into R@@ ente in the coming year .
the place is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are rare .
for 31 years , V@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he con@@ veys in the press room .
he tells of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time wonder@@ ed , that far no application has been fulfilling the requirements specification .
the city looks for the next possible time an architect or construction engineer .
this is how - in compliance with the regular notice of the free@@ zing date - will be enough time for a development .
since Has@@ lach is in charge of the administrative community as a sub @-@ law office , the applic@@ ant must as@@ sign corresponding degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they can no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go for advice up to Off@@ enburg .
but the proximity to the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good operating firm as well as good spirits between the authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office a number of important projects have accum@@ ulated , looks back at the st@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the pre@@ cip@@ itation @-@ parking lot are mentioned .
the Kin@@ zig@@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will hit around 1.5 million Euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we &apos;re doing it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all the great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
embro@@ i@@ dered aside for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister large room available .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener could be flexi@@ bly responded to as much as possible .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the founders I will often be praised by citizens and visitors .
since the old city stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what rein@@ forces , when new@@ buildings are approved , stresses the crus@@ ing Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is contributing high responsibility .
he is builder , &quot; in the end everything is running here through my table . &quot;
for consideration and coordination he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Scho@@ er ( Tief@@ en@@ bau ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains for a long , wish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for continuity is not only important for a good business , but also for the further development of the city .
who Roland W@@ acker wants to inform about information of the city of Has@@ lach a completed study as a di@@ pl@@ ural engineer or Bachelor with professional architecture and feature good knowledge in the fields of construction and construction industry .

bicycle on lines made : South @-@ way closed
according to police the un@@ known crimin@@ als had so far drawn the blue bike from the railway station in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so heavily damaged that the her@@ al@@ ot freight has to be lifted .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male perpet@@ rators and are looking for the night hours to them .
close to the Tat@@ ort we have been witn@@ essed a pink sco@@ oter and a bike driver had been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond an Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ stre@@ ich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA .
the or the perpet@@ rators would have put themselves in great danger and also thre@@ aten the rail traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay in the traffic @-@ market traffic , the rail@@ ways of the rail@@ road can also be found on the perpet@@ rators of the rail@@ road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall be done by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was re@@ medi@@ ated on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ way could be guided without disabilities .
barely ten characters were Friday morning , two of them consider the correspondence .
Gü@@ ter@@ rains were not falling away , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged about 200 meters above .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( Infl@@ amed bow@@ el diseases ) to lin@@ ders
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases .
the incur@@ able condition , affecting in the US around 1,3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , cause gast@@ ric cr@@ amps and se@@ w , recur@@ ring or bloody crimes , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the person is normally advised to re@@ lie@@ ve meat and dairy products to re@@ lie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Washingtoner Artenschutz@@ überein@@ kommen , found the essential amino acid tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an of proteins that contributes to the immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the Dar@@ m pat@@ rou@@ ched to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes that hide in the meal not into the body .
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue .
when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in a inflammat@@ ory perception .
in experiments that has been observed that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs in mice , which wear a certain bacter@@ ium in its inv@@ ents .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial infection - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - who is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an the mice in their food had , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an @-@ rich diet toler@@ ate , less inflammat@@ ory intest@@ inal balance when the same system is also present in people .
the post@@ doc@@ tor@@ ate Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an studied a kind of immune cell that encourages the tolerance when they found that a group of study of study had such cells , but another group of the same tribe but separated from them .
they suspected that the difference had to do with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ osis of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i who usually live in the gast@@ ro @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
the dy@@ es of the mice have been DNA @-@ sequ@@ ences and there were six bacterial types , which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them inf@@ alli@@ ed with mice .
mice were raised in an ster@@ ile environment , so that one was missing in a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ om and did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria performed on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i let grow in a fluid , and over@@ led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ant @-@ toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of the liquid has been cleaned , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as an In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ Mil@@ an acid .
if the researchers have double the amount of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but if the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ ae were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ anced cells such as mice , and that most of us protect us reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ ane @-@ side products made by L. reu@@ ter@@ i , cells of men develop as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an were found in people with inflammat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially can lead high tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ ae in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to increase its popularity . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get , thank you for the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given us great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft unit Boeing has the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky painted .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US @-@ State Washington from the drawing , but began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
to be on the rad@@ ar was the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole thing was a digest@@ i@@ est for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
however , as the wind turns : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD @-@ chief , saw Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin .
merely no stur@@ geons from the party central , merely a counter @-@ wind from the covenant - so the most important wish of the elec@@ toral fighters .
since Martin Schulz , the party has led the fundamental change .
since then , the employees have been watching out of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with a growing set @-@ up events in the SPD &apos;s state capitals .
what Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year , if the wind was not described in the approach .
there were lows .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ Green can simply not be reli@@ ably ruled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the Red@@ aktions@@ netz@@ werk Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprise leader in a Green Parliament has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the final election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its anti @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Bundes@@ platz Michael Kell@@ ner has promp@@ ted the Ab@@ tr@@ ün@@ n@@ ish Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Grünen @-@ Euro El@@ ke T@@ ent to return their mandate .
the transfer to the CD@@ U means a clear violation of the elec@@ tor@@ ment .
El@@ ke T@@ westen needs to immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Bundes@@ liga and Leg@@ ends of the Green Party network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ ted a SPD @-@ election &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as on Friday morning the new Hi@@ obs@@ bot@@ ty is reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , stands after the transition by the green S El@@ ke T@@ ent to the CD@@ U without his own government .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected significant defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades .
after the National@@ rats@@ wahlen 1945 @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , everything will be different .
it was then also - and it all became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to Tau@@ m@@ eln , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite Haute the party smoothly .
the comrades raised the comrades in the weeks after that time .
then when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next draft .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Scholz , the last strong SPD parliamentary group , lost his Nim@@ bus , because he harmon@@ ie in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while he burned his city .
and because he in crisis communication had done so quite everything you can do wrong .
since then , Scholz is fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW @-@ Ab@@ bure@@ tor and its role in the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister has been in criticism for a longer period .
mi@@ ese revers@@ al values came to .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely , the we@@ dge tried to put more and more attention in the federal government in the past weeks .
the aim of the former civil society of Hanover , to build its power in Berlin also remained hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him give him a stabil@@ isation of the party , as they were able to stabil@@ ise the party .
now the exact opposite can enter .
the we@@ dge meets the im@@ partial tw@@ ist of the Lower Gre@@ ens in essence not gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz certainly did not .
once sometimes the comrades are trying to hold its own ranks .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the Fe@@ el parliament@@ arians .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ acies such as Mrs T@@ jack@@ ets their own career interests above the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , leader of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ westen is not yet been elected because of her person as director , but on the State of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on the Parliament , thus on the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on members .
the logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD parliamentary group , l@@ aments a &quot; non @-@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters of four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan W@@ eil as Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who introduces the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; State @-@ Sax@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; State candidate at the Bundestag &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we fal@@ si@@ fy the personal career orientation of a future CD@@ U members &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clar@@ if@@ ying the background .
I don &apos;t want to know if any more or it has been supple@@ mented by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ s@@ achsen
sponsors for plac@@ e@@ ers III
who wants to be able to get his back into the years can soon get support from the country .
moreover , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives Ste@@ g Stadt@@ entwicklung started on Wednesday .
at the start of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once a review of the hi@@ ther@@ to .
since 1991 we give it in a regular refurb@@ ishment .
back then , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding .
in the refurb@@ ishment of II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy still exceeded 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the former renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the internal development , and not only close new construction areas .
on April 4th you have received the information from the Intergovernmental Conference on 4 April that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the funding amount of 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which there were 500 000 Euros of the country , the rest of the church received .
how does a refurb@@ ishment arises ?
you will continue , examine , examine , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area in general interest , to san@@ itation .
if necessary , the territory could also be postpon@@ ed again .
the ste@@ el@@ works on the evening evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
the cellar presented the contents of the federal states &apos; Social Fund , &quot; where the san@@ itation would then be carried out .
the core of the programme is the rev@@ itali@@ zation of internal cities , improving the living and working conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is to be carried out per property .
the refurb@@ ishment would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the authorisation period for the sponsors has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
yet until September of this year , however , the survey would only be performed , as part of those which en@@ du@@ red an questionnaire to filling in the refurb@@ ishment area .
in November or December the stat@@ ute can take place as soon as possible , with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that any commun@@ e must carry out the poss@@ essed investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about assessing the municipal ty@@ po@@ ds and decide when it is used and to which extent .
there will also be a san@@ itation for the respective property as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again and get a picture of the situation , she spoke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel empha@@ sized , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , quest@@ ionn@@ aires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and plot hat@@ ch , &quot; where it works among other things about the construction state and the refurb@@ ishment .
in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; the information on size , distribution and residents of a living space can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; factory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if buildings are operated in the buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , new measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler empha@@ sized that the distribution of the convey@@ or after the &quot; wind band principle &quot; fun@@ eral - who first comes , remin@@ ders first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot reserve a funding session for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plac@@ ements II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that it can open its door@@ step , entering its office and even start with a handful of movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chip between thum@@ b and fore@@ finger im@@ pl@@ ets and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has worked with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory services at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedures is carried out to medical standards .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars , so they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .

the wh@@ ites of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the choice of the White House , a nav@@ y helic@@ opter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that cost the American production last month , cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the specification of the military that have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House took a tour of all 50 states .
the helic@@ opter helic@@ opter was featured next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ power car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the Military office of the White House required the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn landed , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for running the helic@@ opter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of it , because it is an unusual event with a high point of visibility , &quot; the com@@ mander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for Avi@@ ation .
the message showed that the helic@@ opter met at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 am .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the restriction of the utility a second team needed for the flight back .
the original airplane was during the event at the helic@@ opter , while the safety sp@@ ers@@ onal of the unit stayed on the ground by plane .
from the notes made available out of the TI@@ ME they did not clearly determine if ultimately a second flight period was required .
the H@@ atch Act negotiated to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 is asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the atch , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander .
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; rep@@ lied the dep@@ uty com@@ mander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called by the White House as official event and would not be covered by H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ andi@@ ze the efforts to susp@@ end the government &apos;s regulations .
the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically beneficial purposes is not a new phenomenon .
President are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is un@@ common .
Tr@@ ump led a investigation in February than the presidential airplane before the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that describe its predecessor through its predec@@ essors through its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced , produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said vice @-@ president of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently lead training trips in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to de@@ pose the U.S. President in the White House with precise met@@ allic treasures .
as a Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was conducted in the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the training needs of the passengers for the month , he said officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helic@@ opter units flo@@ ods in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ president . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved to put the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not support budget paintings , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Defense Department for the Financial Year 2017 , the instructor patch is for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit de@@ record the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the hom@@ age of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of running the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax pay@@ ers based on estimates for re@@ funds are highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs involved in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a Rand study from 2015 , the equipment for do@@ D does not include the personnel costs , but also take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and transfer .
at this time the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are manufactured in America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the federal state remains very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ent@@ lessly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to empha@@ size this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether tr@@ ump with the helic@@ opter was inter@@ ven@@ ed when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and Ash@@ ley with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump is not having his signature in the evening his signature under the law of the ti@@ ghtening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his heat , the law let &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ packed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Congress has packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sp@@ amed against US impetus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft states to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , investors are worried by domestic O@@ MV , which are co @-@ financed with other European companies in the construction of the Russian Ost@@ se@@ el@@ eit@@ ing Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is more powerful .
nonetheless , it too early for an assessment of the consequences , such is the official statement of the oil concept .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump should have had the sanctions on life even by executive order .

role back@@ wards : the city offers 46 ch@@ ai@@ ds
the city runs the K@@ ita @-@ May@@ table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the municipal nur@@ sery @-@ workshops the clock is revers@@ ed .
to the 1st of September the city Kre@@ feld takes over the eating facilities in the urban centre of nur@@ sery ( Kit@@ as ) again in its own rainy day .
for Sonja P@@ omm@@ ance , dep@@ uty leader in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we all have been very pleased . &quot;
cooked continues to be except house : a Cat@@ erer is taking over this task and provides fresh@@ ly bo@@ iled cool@@ ed .
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 children &apos;s locations , in 44 the children get a warm meal for lunch and lunch .
in the last day , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who will be taken care of 45 Wo@@ und in the K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains P@@ omm@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision if children stay up to 14 am . &quot;
46 sub @-@ magazines have been on the 1st of September kitchen : they war@@ med the Gospel meals , complement it to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individual , give the food out , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ omm@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ group@@ ings as well as seven @-@ scale facilities - will decide on the class .
&quot; the hel@@ pers are now firm to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says P@@ omm@@ ance satisfied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier for the kit@@ eline &apos;s kit@@ eline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for that is why it is a healthy diet and cooking lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children will help to prepare the meal &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ power to the team is therefore sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not ever @-@ changing humans . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleans@@ ing of the K@@ ita spaces - so far as the task of the chef - is done in future by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the chef also has the charm that they have issued in the cost@@ ume between self @-@ reg@@ im@@ en and foreign exchange for the city as the thri@@ f@@ ti@@ est , meaning it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ tim@@ ers are re @-@ employed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are falling into about 750 people in the drawing area and not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sonja P@@ omm@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mc@@ V@@ ital owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union officials would be experienced as the first if their activities would change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the branch of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ry &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB Senior organizer of Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members deeply .
generations of families have worked here and the labor force strongly focus on local community and gener@@ osity Glas@@ gow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , of Loh@@ ns and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising life costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow strongly urgently need a thri@@ ving production stage at Mc@@ Vit@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ iter at T@@ oll@@ cross had only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this , as we appreciate the continued commitment in employees and trade union officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meetings with staff and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the staff that we work like all companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic crisis , our business is continuously checked - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full and we should change our business procedures at the site , the employees and their trade union officials will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the PSG Barcelona have warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is in@@ duc@@ ted in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after having given an offer of £ 189 million in order to dis@@ solve its free@@ wheel cl@@ ause , but have they warned of three years before the world dis@@ ap@@ se ?
the sens@@ ational approach has raised the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world records by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United returned .
after the completion of N@@ ey@@ mar , the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although a source is at the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans Pre@@ view , that the club always has given its best to take care of it since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of him .
but was the football world warned of three years ago by the PSG President in front of this prospect ?
as Manchester City 2014 , interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association , who wanted to sign one of the best players from PSG .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will face in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we all respect the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try one of our players to sign in sign , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish club was in the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG area of Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PSG empha@@ sized that they could not allow the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese is looking for the police witness .
because he came up a car on his driving track , the driver had to so@@ ak of a VW Tour@@ an and touch@@ down the lines of leadership .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au , coming in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , there came to him a truck on his driver , so he had to go to the right .
the tour operator will be touch@@ able for the tour planning .
on the truck was created facts .
the driver of the next passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had taken over a truck and continue his drive without having to take care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident , it may well be good that the Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es@@ kers had not noticed the accident at all .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Bericht ent@@ last@@ ly pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report about the abuse of mis@@ use pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report to the Miss@@ ing sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen will continue for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ enheim , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after release from former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Car@@ dinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have expressed deep concerns about his own sub@@ ordin@@ ations or their then false evaluation of processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand crit@@ ici@@ zed that during the coverage of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two verti@@ ces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of the handles in Regensburg in@@ doubt that it would have to be prevented by &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; but the &quot; degree medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; then the &quot; degree medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; so the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histor@@ ik@@ erin and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of call the cath@@ olic church as a source of all evil , is part of the day experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prin@@ c@@ ality of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; he likes to go on the church , and that is a fil@@ ly fres@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be ready with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair to present current standards over past decades , because the world has changed .
in the context of reports about the abuse of abuse often also the pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger took the memories &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the writer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 54@@ 7 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were measured between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high pl@@ ess@@ ness , &quot; victims of vi@@ als , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
particularly at high emoti@@ on@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be disast@@ rous .
however , unlike many other schol@@ ars that many victims caught the general humanity by R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence they even connect positive memories with it . &quot;
in the interview Hes@@ emann , why the final report is to the abuse of the abuse of the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence exercise at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
to one lift many students stand out his &quot; humanity &quot; .
on the other hand he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who has been hand@@ ma@@ yed by the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a domain has not brought any top performance .
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ grapher this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : once you read the trouble and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all in it .
he has just returned eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspic@@ ion of the Mitt@@ ae@@ der or mit@@ ig@@ ate in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
the non@@ violence at the school was ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of its efficiency .
it is possible to throw him up , to find it too late or not taken seriously enough for the first sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ it@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he was effective , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as - so literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the vast majority of his students &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which made guys regular with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always was surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
merely a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emoti@@ on@@ ality , which also led to guard .
that he did not only thre@@ w it with chairs and cast the key@@ chain with k@@ icks and cast lots on the floor , but also ear@@ ches l@@ aces on the hair or ears , he himself has been given to the hair or ears , deeply regret and exc@@ used for it .
to his honor salvation , however , must be said that such y@@ ler methods were pre@@ valent in the question@@ able time , the 19@@ 70s and 19@@ 70s , were widely used in parents like with teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think any of us who was born in 1968 .
also I have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state Gymnasium .
compared to what it is actually happening in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and violence at the pre@@ school , the un@@ common bag@@ at@@ elles .
then one asked whether it was not rather with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just dropped on him .
on the bay@@ er@@ arian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him , yet always eager .
but the truth is : the story un@@ paved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
the media has been reported in connection with the report on the topic of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is placed in the final report any mer@@ ging or mit@@ ig@@ ate with regard to sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual transfers claimed to have become acquain@@ ted with the Chapter .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dre@@ amed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those who came from , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true issue in the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims of shame remain silent .
if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir conduc@@ tors who had been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do you evaluate Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ pupils R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it so : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he would have had to have acquired ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and would have been able to stop the perpet@@ rators .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to suppose that their ... bub@@ bles would have opened an intru@@ der or more explicit or more rather than against their parents , dormit@@ ory conduc@@ tors , and confidence @-@ teachers , etc .
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that dealt with him in advance of the people and / or their environment , could not be confirmed as part of the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus speaking of every co @-@ union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus it cannot be accused of having not prevented him or have brought it to the display . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there is no reason to connect his good name with these res@@ lu@@ ent crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media has been much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non@@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; away in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this acc@@ us@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and bl@@ ends to become a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the midst of the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly a mis@@ use of the report .
namely , there will be clean separated : between the pre@@ school and the gramm@@ ar of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir conduc@@ tors of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the entire terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which h@@ ubs of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were regul@@ ates and mal@@ ign@@ ites and under@@ took them during the Vor@@ schule in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to have .
but with whom he had nothing to do with Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for he did not get the boys just as they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ cle bin .
upon what was the most witnesses stress , the subject of &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; tab@@ u .
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different in the domain of the domain ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there had been discipline , but there is no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims caught the general humanity by R. ; and therefore in numerous cases despite violence have even positive memories with him . &quot;
so the most still remains the acc@@ us@@ ation to have ch@@ ew@@ ed .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he reports on the pre@@ school at the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school , where he did not work and responsible , ( so the stuff ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again in 1993 .
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the conditions consistent with the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ cle bin , which even re@@ produced the report .
in this he pointed out this , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , the test will continue to be pract@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the light of the danger of negative Pres@@ ses , he recommended an urgent introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted , when exam@@ inations were also banned in Bavaria too long .
before , they created themselves in a legal gray area , like everyone of us still knows .
there was also difficult for him to cher@@ ish , where those affected might have been exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the permitted limit was over@@ step@@ ped out .
but one can also not say he had always been ch@@ ew@@ ed .
this is just not true .
only in 1980 the test was officially completed in schools in Bavaria too .
prin@@ z gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the dam@@ al@@ ous period of time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we were talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger that existed according to today &apos;s moral standards .
there the prin@@ c@@ ess was right now .
but this is of course not true for sexual abuse at all times , and also not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance , and violence against inno@@ cent children se@@ els , which goes far beyond that time .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so p@@ aving ear@@ ns and pul@@ ling in hair and ears were widely used in the 19@@ 70s .
as an bodily punishment then it was forbidden to strictly adh@@ ere to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which image of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Zeit has given Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the topic test then also the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book there is about the life of his brother Joseph , so the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI from his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t refuse so that he held a strict Reg@@ iment there .
but that has to be said once again : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the solic@@ ited un@@ related discipline , it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of world @-@ known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen a institution of world @-@ tran@@ sp@@ ies , true cultural botanical of Europe and its musical tradition , which went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with Kek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you do not have a big singer and stand before every success , right in which area , still discipline , passion and overcoming themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of people have you experienced in the talks on her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : by working on the book and in addition I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well @-@ known and repeat@@ ed@@ ely experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply unbeliev@@ ing and hearty persons , from which one could not imagine , that he could not only do a fly @-@ silk .
I come to regularly , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen even today , 23 years after its Emer@@ itus , keep in contact with him , visit him - he is almost blind to him and treat it as a member of their family .
those who have not for@@ given him to the present day , that he once was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he was always a good , v@@ ä@@ ff@@ ian teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but it was also a lovely respect person , to which they still have a look and to worship them .
and please , once again , all that one thro@@ ws it , are educ@@ ating methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we may be glad we have overcome this time ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has one more prominent brother to do to medi@@ al s@@ ün@@ den@@ bock .
there is the evil intention that is behind it , just too obvious .
because the report that has just been published , un@@ paved him .
now she would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen - finally in peace .
