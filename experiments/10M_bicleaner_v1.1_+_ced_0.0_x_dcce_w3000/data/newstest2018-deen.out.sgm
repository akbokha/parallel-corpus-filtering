<seg id="2">A Irish Anstalt, where young people will encounter today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruykapelle, where now for the S-Bahn-Tunnel will be dug.</seg>
<seg id="4">Smallness are cultivating the single-term basis of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official ticket of Munich also encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is more nervous when maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows each one who had to watch for some time, because the car-Navi was instead of a reversal street to a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the Digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal of Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but currently very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickr eppich, which you do not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large .postcard for towns and villages more detailed maps, so-called judging blades were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">This originated according to the Bayerisches Vermessenger management between 1810 and 1864, and from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition of War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an topographical recording of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops took place with the peace of Lunéville, 9 February 1801: it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a surface-covering Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max. Joseph pushed the project further, founded the "topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Vermessenger management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The chading system for Munich is from the year 1856 and can be found like the other on the Bavaria's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the morning / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded throughout all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is submissions that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after building the map, i.e. 1877, as Münchner district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today submissions are in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of underscores are concentrated at 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the West park is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when Hingene lines there appears a smallish map with dozens of lines and numbers: handmade Flurpieces from the so-called "urine" which was derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots have no farmers left there - but the small resser of the plant "Land of Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterized by the north of the submissions.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 showreel of the Oktoberin tests, was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the word leaflet, one reads in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen, not only the street name "at Gasteig" or from the arrival "On the air," but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße man once attacked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was the" "" "Münchner Circle-Irrenanstalt" "" "was founded in 1858 / 59." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden put the establishment - that psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwigs II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended the purchase of the so-called Irren" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has banned the personnel to use violence against the inmates, "Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has engaged itself in an exhibition with the Anstalt Museum.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had at first been a place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 there is the Isar-Amper-Amper-Ost-East Germany, one of Germany's largest lawyers in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the real of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Münchner Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The orden was the building complex 1920 and walked in a youth-home with training schemes.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is located by the TSV Munich East, east of the museum houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the kids "House" Casa Don Bosco "- in an architecturally tendence to the origin of the Irrenanstalt made in the Second World War were destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was about 1856 as" "" "main square" "", "the Kaufingerstraße" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business buildings and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once carried out at Marienhof, where this day was the lead and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich will take place for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and the hole in the Marienhof fill up.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes Destinations for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of colored people has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri based on discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, who take effect until 28 August 2017, invites visitors to take special attention in travel through the state, since a number of questioned, racial rebased incidents occur in the entire state and can be noted here," "" "said it is in the position of the group."

<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such frequency, which we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that has issued the Organisation for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group poignited incidents like rassistic understanding against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragranding circumstances at the beginning of the year after being taken in custody during the journey through the state and was taken in custody by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "the Council also pointed to a recent report by the general state of the general state-state of Missouri in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than pasture." ""</seg>

<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready to bring light money or to know the relatives that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded in 2015 100 Hasslner, after the latest figures from the Hasseneburg-reporting program of FBI, which began the state with regards to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The itinerary is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to complain about a business because of housing or employment.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously the American Civil War lasted for Texas and Arizona (ACLU) travel routes for Texas and Arizona, after the states to commit immigration regulations to suspect humans for immigration causes, which will be contributing to further forms of racial understanding.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries but in recent times, stakeholders have implemented the measure response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidecaying project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weidezhen project is a success project and continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag, Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family met representatives of the fishing bacher CDU-local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwennmann gives first insights into its operation, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk, and as well as many young animals, and in five apartments of holiday houses.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwaldmch" is for him the alternate market for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">The table of the fengffort comes exclusively regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also a BLHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, he describes the Weightens project as "elementary". "</seg>

<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and with the Topgraphics," "" "says Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elteral operation and observed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even though it is not a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has detected the importance of the Weibel-project and is pleased with the leader" "" "leader" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare would have to be supported by farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the rising of the plots could still be done for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure that we have is people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," "" "he said Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism due to funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open area is thus 40 hectare, which can not be restled until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euros was funded half of the Leader, a quarter carried out the municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers have had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of Weidezhen.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and country-wives." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="91">The Landsaccountant line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of ordination.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisites is the presence of one of the LPR proficicult.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosure area may not be less difficult (hangover 35 per cent) and must thus be threatened by the acceleration.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fishing bacher Weideton project 2018, the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 plots that want to build nearly 16 kilometers of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open surface is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now, the White House of Trump is taking off the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans cherish these as well as any other - hence the carnified Sturz Saddam Hussone on the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologues of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he wrote a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller is not a statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetties and Liberty-Imitators would have suffered from him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he laid hold on their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was written by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta claims:" "" "I don't want to go here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem on which you refer to which was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it itself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the elaborate words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your mind, thy poor, / your pressed masses, which will soon longing, free to breathe, / the elicuous waste of your rich coast."</seg>
<seg id="109">There never was a time when the "misled waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not committed to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the mumps.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural examination: it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who campaigned to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they have been a high-political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the ties between French and American republicans by presenting the female embodiment of the female embodiment of the Freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus did change this meaning: in its poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has got a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves are a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to withdraw from the right wing this long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big scribe to Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is questioned, but rather an early neo-conservatives, who bring the American flame into the umided world: "Lady Liberty is proceeding."</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not meant to enlighten the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here upon something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative action of Lazarus consisted of Lazarus was to see her from the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the Decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that you would ever want to recognize the Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not meant to enlighten the way, but the hatred who is their only source of power to ignite.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle reminiscent of a time when only two villi have belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-silver medalligwriter, which is present with its fifth world cup at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable," that 16 hits in the British team are.</seg>

<seg id="161">The Father of our land knew some of the bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington but it didn't take long until the newspapers took it because of everything, from the domestic policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shook upon the criticism, surely.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>

<seg id="167">Hofer employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil liberties defendant him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The rod of Gouverneurs left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when there is a type like Hogan.</seg>

<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand at the guidance of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as primary means to link up with his voters and playing his hairy garment after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blockade of people who come to the side of the Governors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and paid by employees, which are paid as officially - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hoan Speakers in Amelia Chasse the actions of the governor and argued that the blockade of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>

<seg id="188">What the employees of the governor were referred to as "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "intercate."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or delete a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lines and to burn them or to silence them.</seg>

<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power, crews of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair-Play rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA, meaning that PSG to point out at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without great losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid $222 €(262 million) to buy the Brazilians from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can do with safety the money so that Neymar writes down and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich manor family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations should contact a lot of money for the purchase of players, but they must be subject to legitimate income sources, which enable them to make the break-related point in their attention to the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini in his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that comparisons had enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively fraud and rised to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP moved up to concentration on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change signifies that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then continued vigorated to build the crew and build a global brand - to a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP contracted period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini was like to please by the presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be seen from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will still reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP with the UEFA for FFP past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG does not pay the buy-out clause by Neymar in a flat job, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signs a five-year treaty, so the redemption rates for the next five years can be transferred to the amount of 44,4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a sentence of 60 million Euros (then 82 million dollars), which later has been reduced to 20 million euros, and it was arranged that the team members are limited to the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is in search of clubs, which could try to overhead their financial supervision by joining their revenues by companies, connected by the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a katarian company could provide the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly that happened 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was built by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar was made on payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Katar 2022, argued that Neymar World Ambassador will be and an such maneuver for UEFA regulators can be just finding out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG means that the UEFA will still be careful, every attempt to observe the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no pre-prepared conversation with PSG about Neymars transfer, sagging on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke among the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved sales of €542.4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year will still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsoring Deals, merchandising and trikotdivides.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association considers that the turnover of the signature by at least 30 percent will increase.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers to see, and trying to prevent Neymars waypoint by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial lidoping" "" "with the club and the State," "" "said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's owner of the owner." ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living big life: mezzanine and clever designers have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, was smaller in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold their bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was similar to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love in her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit the 1,000 square-foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room house with a snowbed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a tub storage room and mezzanine to make the generous cover height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">This was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end, she commissioned the Architektur- and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces with one another so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative thinking in order to solve the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelworks is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overworked out, without having to bade our heads." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to attach the steel to it that he had the right height for the function above or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement created it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine you can look down a classic couplight window by Retrouvius via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Grenled gold furniture, silberne Akzente and vintage Serge Mouille covers the style of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of spider plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let him work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror just feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we have mirrored units for all seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamorbit space, the kitchen of the living room can complete the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garrison.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went into" "" "explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is insignificant, so that when you slide the door very easily, very easy."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win an additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or as your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate makler will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high-quality materials, which gain the space of the luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't dearest you into the electric plugs in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metaphors from something standard into something quite admirable.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to leave this not.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly could actually do.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first one.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the chef on a uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new staff of the White House, at his first working day, he arranged a major problem in President Donald Trumps" "", "which he wants to repair: poor information that has been into the hands of the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the President would make better decisions, if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to suffer trump by monitoring its media sows.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television dates back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Kandidat Trump was upset because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places to convince," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February opposite to Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to keep on Twitter-habit under control, according to six former electoral campaigns to ensure that his personal media consum a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that trumps Twitter-habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these battagnate warts something that we did not know - that mumps ets would have even more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets, the Trump is not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had made it a few times, anger from it, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it, that Trump's controversy is provoked.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem lies in that the people in a white house that relies from competing parties, always try to bring their own agenda by presenting Trump material that fosters their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultants, the president for the strategic grounds of the dubious information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example which was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump-officials say that Trump and a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leak, and that he is stressing to find out where these originates." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone had a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet-provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy head office in Katie Walsh, "the source behind a bunch of leak" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banned from Twitter for Schikanen, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and to revoke them in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher implied that the dament Stabschef Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that folded?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly attempts three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to the lack of drought reminding conditions and because of illness confering insects, resulting from scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agrarian institutions CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change during the past years, and in the autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cement, a microbacterium, the dwarf-gonads, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt official and ceaseless drug application.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change its routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what is safe to feel secure: they are supposed to take their children into the office which were the target of an attack with granulates or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrality, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal tract.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug addictions, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the pavement of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest break from violence, and while in the whole country the corpses are more and more journalists have taken place at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 took office. 589 are following attacks and threats under Bundesschutz und till now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter there is a publisher and its inspirer from Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its absence will be deeply perceived as his presence everywhere is present - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his Middle-finger here with the word "Justice" on the frontage of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts who show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamera.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared topics, the trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, Paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 has been erected a Sonder's Office, in order to edit the cases of journalists, it has led to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, which are associated every year with drug-drug and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">With Riodoce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa although they are imprisoned and even though the terrain is still traitorous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting to discussion of security is little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why misstrust we all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of the 15th of May Valdez has left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot onto him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with the "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to travel freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's imprisonment last year and the delivery into the United States in January was Sinaloa became one of the bloody crimes of the country, as rivaling factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of branded, two-story mouse-een for drug-men, which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "calm" "" "when only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Boyorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder of murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalled cartels in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This announcement may have annoyed the sons, presumably vans bought each copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to time period.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was to force Valdez not to compel after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had released the same story to leave the country towards its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived his friends and colleagues that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues to the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without having to encounter the smote problem, "said Kaorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">In time the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest coverage, and revenue and advertising took.</seg>
<seg id="1848">They loved to publish hard fired investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were captivated by a publication in which they could read stories, which nobody else could treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she was awarded the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez presented the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they go.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntarily to him that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">Trading in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.</seg>

<seg id="1858">He would always carry his guard.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always sink to El Guayabo, the bar towards the office, and always sit down at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine be his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also compelled them to ask their own assumptions about how they do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start and cross-roads to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Kaorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-tolerances and self-employment.</seg>

<seg id="1866">If it smells, keep away from it.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken as far as their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis lived on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a mail from someone from the high school.</seg>

<seg id="2024">Confused, since nobody else posted on her feed, she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was continually released on their timeline retweetet.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns's lively body that was stretched on the road and staying there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," thought Ferrell at himself.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put their mobile phone to return later in the evening tweets over people on the canfield drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police band and people, crying, and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording: "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live-feed in which a policeman from a group of demonstrators with a rebellious dog was standing.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said that another police officer his rifle and cried:" "" "I will kill you... animals all kill." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she fetched her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and the protest, of love and loss, the strength and resistance of resistance which live from the perspective of people, who live in the community and have filled the streets to answer responses.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "when Ferrell with her daughter who carried a flower garment and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, bespoke the two a conversation, which she had countless occasions in this morning" about the black experience and the black state. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we now go to Ferguson because the police have a 18-year-old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take her, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">They have to know it and it must be seen and raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have the happiness to give her an experience in which they personally have no ekless racism then it is no different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would prove it a bad service to keep it away from it. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was a campground, when the activists was awaiting the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly started to take a new type of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August totally," she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health qualities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "" "" "I had no experience in organizing." ""</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came out of Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism became nourished by innumerable cases of people, often from whites - in a community that profited from their pain and its resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently declared in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson, their votes have not been centered and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around Todestrails.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years to Brownism.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, as these people are shown, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but a community which comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most open guest in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets show" surprising personal aspects of Ferrells's life as she likes to love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells has repeatedly repeating the role of the black gay women in the wider black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media than swul.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must carry the main last of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agrees to remark that" "" "the movement is kept alive by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is no affirmatical type of action," "" "when the Ferrell was chosen due to their identity as the heart of the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who raised this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because in a life there is so much on these cross as a black, sulphule woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the communication era in Ferguson has long since disappeared, but the racial links between the municipality and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is for 2 ½ years due to the blockade of a highway on a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the social-policy atmosphere of the area that it calls their homes: "a mess."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she felt obliged to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the road three years ago.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the advocates are building that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which also the rest of business will benefit, the opponents, that then the pedestrian zone are bleeding.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many shopkeedies are here empty - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Since there is not even a proper weekly market, it is all the more important that we at least keep up the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods offered is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, cargo transactions will be located at a shopping center only by larger companies, because the dorms are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2123">When the farmers market hall is made, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portrait of Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the center of the space of Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which hang almost invariably similar to cables by the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist's Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and hair sections that were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Knoavenworth, where the former secret service analyst did a 35 years imprisonment, after it made a secret diplomatic messages about the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is said to be A Becoming Usblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg who built their discipline competency in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman, and landmark, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his post.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg was created by the algorithms, created by Manning extracts and made out of 30 portraits, as anyone with these genetic data could look a sharp, even though some intellectual comment may not only be related to the formation of DNA data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already talked openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced to 2013 because of 20 accusations, including six breaches of the espionegesetz, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison its picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a gratious, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is clearly uncomfortable at a driver's seat and a platine blonde carries - with which it was associated with.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project "Stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist's portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarettes and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a time period.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not see at that time and she could not get photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, asking her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their detained Muse became unequal euphrees, which have interchangeover several years over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic "supplements" who foresaw a future in which the president does not convert his opinion, and it would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only had a few days after the book was released, Manning liberation for seven brutal years in a military court in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happiction.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also a difference in the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starke, because Donald Trump will lead a war against informants from the government camps and against transgender troops to rectifying new, tweed paths that he should actually fix, further diagrams.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all of these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery the written artistic statement called Manning with its overbig subordinance, including (the "i" in their surname is equipped with a heart) an end to the automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), such as amazing, at least in biological sense, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will say about it is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-works of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own space is a page from the above comic-Novelle.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robotic is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it won't be even crazy here, a new report comes across technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) has a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emergent professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take her rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eyeces of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of Fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make them funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will get them much more frequent," "" "said Mr Sharkey in the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex lips have developed from their inflatable partners to robotic with a silicone cornea, which feels warm to the touch - with deliberately human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adapt his robots according to his beliefs "and thereby select everything from the eyeces of the robot to the shape of the nipples until the guy or the color of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still worrying since many robots own the "personalities" that would be a stepping-woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexy lips have developed to robotic with a silicone cornea.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot makes it an example of its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they find responsive as such as relaping.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are still the True Companion developed roxxxy Gold sex robots with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relapness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," "" "warms the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So they may, what you like, and they don't like what you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day her moods had - all like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it may be tired of fixing on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are lots of disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subversive female properties, recitation on rape if one passes a step on Frigid (is here: resides) Farrah, beeatedly a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website adorable True Companion Roxxxy with a VIBRATOR, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a VIBRATOR, why do men do not have a Roxxxy?" is it on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just merely another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Her emergence and increased refinement point out a bit darker and deeper in our culture to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course hold no sex robot, while the FRR rejects its growing popularity, they are still temporary on the edge of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what out of the edge-zones can be sickened, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offended up until them there is free market for permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain evidence that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time in which the rights of women are threatened, in which in the White House there is a president who has been prahated to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The abominous aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the continuous body and the pronounced eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robotics is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, to the point when it comes to her" "" "personalities" "", "the robots do not represent real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separate or just away from their companions.</seg>
<seg id="2421">You do not have a mediation or a background history, nothing that hints on independence or anything that could interfere the fantasy of dead submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Other words expressed: they are counterfful slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech by 2017: Official nanny</seg>
<seg id="2424">Wearing Big Performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of the healthy human sense.</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binsenheit of the Trump era that the political divisions, who have polarized the U.S. voters, even families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest feast, there were newspaper in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump of seltermination.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly supposed to leave our filtering.</seg>
<seg id="2429">It has been less noticed the power trumps, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousine, a left-oriented poet, who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows she knows, including the Republican Relief, who fought for decades due to politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it annoyed me in another context that this will also bring significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump but the kidding effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalisation" and clump, we refer to the graculous possibility that our mothers of a day do not come across more.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is a still startling long-time scenario, in which Trump republicans of the right wing "normalized" that suddenly appear to its standards as a begriff of denial.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the expire - the dog on the audach, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return saw) - both compared to Trump in fact proves to be very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidat of the Republican only be mentally to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousins in the city was, we brought our children to the Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the Carussell's New Yorker's car department, and the top three dollars to spend in town if there is no caffeine needed.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinders - all clowns, are spelled and the animals rotate to look full of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the collimming music conveys this in a notable way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines will become familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five-five years later, and I'm still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the topics pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magic experience, as here two years old, a 11-year old and two women can go to it in the 40-years and have all had a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have liked the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was compelled to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before checking my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the Coffee-House on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to buy the rating with a 15% gratuity - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but exerting pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologised, while I was tired the experience made to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to nominate this time against the six-year-old sentence of Pistorius appeal, from which they say they be too sighted.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Tribunal for the prosecution said that they will be charged with the Supreme Court of Justice of South Africa, and the objection can be heard this year.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (Inflamed bowel diseases) to linders</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, affecting in the US around 1,3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, cause gastric cramps and sew, recurring or bloody crimes, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the person is normally advised to relieve meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner Artenschutzübereinkommen, found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins that contributes to the immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the Darm patrouched to ensure that damaging microbes that hide in the meal not into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory perception.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments that has been observed that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs in mice, which wear a certain bacterium in its invents.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial infection - Lactobacillus reuteri - who is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food had, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an an tryptophan-rich diet tolerate, less inflammatory intestinal balance when the same system is also present in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that encourages the tolerance when they found that a group of study of study had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but separated from them.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiosis of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi who usually live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The dyes of the mice have been DNA-sequences and there were six bacterial types, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them infallied with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in an sterile environment, so that one was missing in a intestinal microbiom and did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria performed on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri let grow in a fluid, and overled small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerant-tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid has been cleaned, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as an Indol-3-Milan acid.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Bericht entlastly pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report about the abuse of misuse pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report to the Missing scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen will continue for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisenheim, spokesman of the reform movement "We are church," stated after release from former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would have expressed deep concerns about his own subordinations or their then false evaluation of processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand criticized that during the coverage of violence at the Domspatzen with" "" "two vertices" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In terms of the handles in Regensburg indoubt that it would have to be prevented by "shameful and shameful deeds" but the "degree medial manipulation," then the "degree medial manipulation," so the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, Historikerin and Member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of call the catholic church as a source of all evil, is part of the day experience and prepares public opinion that for normal" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">The princality of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "he likes to go on the church, and that is a filly fressen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "bats" "" "had been a very normal pedagogical way," "" "to be ready with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to present current standards over past decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In the context of reports about the abuse of abuse often also the pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger took the memories" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I need to take Georg Ratzinger in protection" "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he considers the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report, which was submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with the writer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were measured between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high plessness, "victims of vials, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, so that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Particularly at high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, unlike many other scholars that many victims caught the general humanity by R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence they even connect positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hesemann, why the final report is to the abuse of the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report about the "incidents of violence exercise at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">To one lift many students stand out his "humanity".</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who has been handmayed by the Öfteren when a domain has not brought any top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: once you read the trouble and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just returned eight pages and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the Mittaeder or mitigate in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The nonviolence at the school was expropriated outside of its efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to throw him up, to find it too late or not taken seriously enough for the first sight.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domspatzitan" "" "on which he was effective, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "so the vast majority of his students" "" "Georg Ratzinger also presents him as" "" "warm" "", "" "" "competent" "", "" "" "competent" "", "" "" "competent" "", "and" "" "understanding" "", "which made guys regular with cakes, biscuits and bonbons, and" "" "always was surrounded by grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Merely a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to guard.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only threw it with chairs and cast the keychain with kicks and cast lots on the floor, but also earches laces on the hair or ears, he himself has been given to the hair or ears, deeply regret and excused for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honor salvation, however, must be said that such yler methods were prevalent in the questionable time, the 1970s and 1970s, were widely used in parents like with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think any of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Also I have experienced this in a worldly school, a state Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually happening in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and violence at the preschool, the uncommon bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then one asked whether it was not rather with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just dropped on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the bayerarian pope, many who have never understood him, yet always eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the story unpaved Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media has been reported in connection with the report on the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger is placed in the final report any merging or mitigate with regard to sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual transfers claimed to have become acquainted with the Chapter.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dreamed to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one of those who came from," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true issue in the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims of shame remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir conductors who had been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you evaluate Domspatzen-pupils Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "concerning sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he would have had to have acquired (Georg Ratzinger) and would have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to suppose that their... bubbles would have opened an intruder or more explicit or more rather than against their parents, dormitory conductors, and confidence-teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that dealt with him in advance of the people and / or their environment, could not be confirmed as part of the examination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus speaking of every co-union.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"" "" "" "thus it cannot be accused of having not prevented him or have brought it to the display." ""</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to connect his good name with these resluent crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media has been much of" "" "nonviolence" "" "to read the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will take" "" "away in the report" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and blends to become a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the midst of the Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there will be clean separated: between the preschool and the grammar of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir conductors of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The entire terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which hubs of sadistic teachers were regulates and malignites and undertook them during the Vorschule in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to have.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom he had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, for he did not get the boys just as they were already on the Domspatzcle bin.</seg>
<seg id="2954">Upon what was the most witnesses stress, the subject of "Vorschule" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the domain of the domain?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there had been discipline, but there is no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims caught the general humanity by R.; and therefore in numerous cases despite violence have even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So the most still remains the accusation to have chewed.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he reports on the preschool at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school, where he did not work and responsible, (so the stuff) wanted nothing to hear, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger in front of the conditions consistent with the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzcle bin, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this he pointed out this, "that in the pre-school, the test will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "" "" "even in the light of the danger of negative Presses, he recommended an urgent introduction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted, when examinations were also banned in Bavaria too long.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, they created themselves in a legal gray area, like everyone of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult for him to cherish, where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permitted limit was overstepped out.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can also not say he had always been chewed.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test was officially completed in schools in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Prinz gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to the damalous period of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we were talking about the "pitfalls of anachronism," thus the danger that existed according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There the princess was right now.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not true for sexual abuse at all times, and also not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance, and violence against innocent children seels, which goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for disciplining and punishment, so paving earns and pulling in hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As an bodily punishment then it was forbidden to strictly adhere to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which image of his Regensburger Zeit has given Georg Ratzinger for talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of Pope?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test then also the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book there is about the life of his brother Joseph, so the Pope Benedict XVI from his perspective, the Domspatzen played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't refuse so that he held a strict Regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that has to be said once again: without these perfectionism, without the solicited unrelated discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of world-known Regensburger Domspatzen a institution of world-transpies, true cultural botanical of Europe and its musical tradition, which went twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With Keksen and Bonbons alone, you do not have a big singer and stand before every success, right in which area, still discipline, passion and overcoming themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2987">"" "" "" "what kind of people have you experienced in the talks on her book?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: by working on the book and in addition I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well-known and repeatedely experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply unbelieving and hearty persons, from which one could not imagine, that he could not only do a fly-silk.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I come to regularly, like many former Domspatzen even today, 23 years after its Emeritus, keep in contact with him, visit him - he is almost blind to him and treat it as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him to the present day, that he once was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he was always a good, väffian teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but it was also a lovely respect person, to which they still have a look and to worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again, all that one throws it, are educating methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We may be glad we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has one more prominent brother to do to medial sündenbock.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that is behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report that has just been published, unpaved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now she would have acquired a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen - finally in peace.</seg>
