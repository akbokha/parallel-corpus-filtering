&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still stuck in drawers or come from outside label that have usually little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest , these things are rather sno@@ wing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf club in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a bit of variation with a hor@@ seback ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CHI@@ O : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses reminded of her Fei@@ er@@ abend , they hunt in the fast Gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feeding .
a kilometers at this pace , I have afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and that means the hor@@ seback riding then ended up again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament @-@ fly - again close to horses .
he allowed himself to lead with his family over the plant of AL@@ RV , on a horse he mu@@ st@@ ang himself not even for photographs .
this was the first time in Aachen , and with it also at the CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports were covered by the man from An@@ ny in the context of a small g@@ ala , the Golden Lady &apos;s pyramid .
for distin@@ ctions it is not a sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
Bundes@@ liga , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already pushed him .
quite a long is the 18th prize winner of the Sport@@ pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner , Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only for@@ ge for sporting achievements , but also for soci@@ etal engagement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger supports the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 more outstanding sport athletes the doubt that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the excellent include the athle@@ tic Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mitt , der Tur@@ ner Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ ehmer , the Spring@@ oka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spring@@ ve Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sport@@ s@@ men had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ ator society went to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger did a distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ ton and Voc@@ als Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing the TT@@ P trade agreements - they want to both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the two US presidential competition are in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental resource .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a key , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
that , on the role of the State .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep it small in doubt and war@@ ns how the state of economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to tax@@ ed the economy to death , and to put it to death , he says .
on the other hand , it would be quite different , losing Tr@@ ump .
he will withdraw regulations massi@@ vely , and it makes itself strong for a wide @-@ ranging tax reform with lower controls and for private people and businesses .
Clinton is saying , The State has specific tasks to be able to open up their dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
therefore , the taxes for the rich would increase , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the changes , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ med .
the democratic applic@@ ants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can .
so there could be no internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ power stations and up@@ lift the coal production in the US again .
oil production should also be possible in so far @-@ protected areas that wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton intends to respond to renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two ri@@ vals are not too far away .
t@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ er trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate international trade - but simply keep American jobs better .
they should then be better paid , demands about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollar is a hunger p@@ wage .
it wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not entirely clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ up , then he says he could not be changed .
yet the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on one side stands Tr@@ ump that wants to escape the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics follow him , so that the budget deficit would only grow bigger .
on the other side , Clinton , who at least want to demand from the rich , that they will pay more taxes , and their critics are saying , more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every feared woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who alone can flee , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen are four women .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has laid her little son in his arms .
he gu@@ ises with great eyes curi@@ ously in the room .
his mother is har@@ dened on the top of the table .
until they notice that it is observed .
it sm@@ iles short and k@@ iss@@ ing the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Head of Con@@ dro@@ bs@@ &apos; , a sponsor for Social Off@@ ers in Bavaria , and is among other things dealing with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are feared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they live in Munich in Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all the women and their children in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the facility associated with Pro Famili@@ a and Mün@@ chner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - neither as visitors .
the exception is an increase in front of the door .
&quot; it &apos;s not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here is made on their flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten to torture or death , or because their families send them to be a hop@@ eless according to Europe , &quot; she tells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly because they do not see any other way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country , they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sory , honest@@ y mor@@ ants , slavery or co@@ pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers for example of a bottle of water a sexual act is not rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that as soon as they an@@ emia in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
also here , all women in refugee space would often be considered as a min@@ der@@ wer@@ - and wor@@ sen@@ ing .
that leads to about 90 percent of women who are living in the house in Mün@@ chner north , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t talk to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they often do not help you w@@ aking up , they need more accommodations for them , call on danger .
in Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
to the question whether they w@@ aking from a similar project like in Munich in their competence area , some answers some with no .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in favor of governments not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Sw@@ abi@@ ans alone , women are not divided alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ fran@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some communal facilities or private houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be distributed separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that was published to the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacks the privacy or will men and women together , it can lead to - ongoing - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
laundry rooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women , stands in the study .
how much the women of this reserve needs to feel at the And@@ rang , you can use it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since you have spoken around , we have a long list of waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily get a second house .
assistant pract@@ ition@@ ers : claims according to new workers &quot; actions
dep@@ uty members of the assist@@ ants have called for their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) the British Medical Association ( b@@ ma ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that he had failed to respond to the concerns about the contract .
Assist@@ enz@@ ologists and medical professionals have voted in July on the rejection of a contract which was agreed with the b@@ ma .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted on the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members who was released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the treaty was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board is matched to fully reject the proposed new treaty , and official new negotiations on all are concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today placed a formal application for a special meeting of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ ma Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to take a lead programme for escal@@ ators , beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disputes led to that assist@@ ants of this year was six@@ ty , the first overall inci@@ dents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the manager of the b@@ ma Assist@@ enz@@ ler Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana entered after the election for the ref@@ us@@ al of the agreed contractual conditions , which were recommended by the b@@ ma .
he shared b@@ ma members during meetings , who still took place before the vote of 5@@ 4,000 Assist@@ enz@@ ologists and media students , with that the agreement should be beneficial and adopted .
after the vote , the health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt told that the contract for doctors in England would have been introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give his hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter @-@ player in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot conc@@ eive of the expression that Ankara is going to reconc@@ ile this reconciliation .
there was the glo@@ ve , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile is p@@ alli@@ ed and he radi@@ ated hardly any heating itself , even for its restra@@ ined circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an on the other hand spoke to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I could no longer count .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even improved .
the next day descri@@ bing a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an could have heard so as if never had anything bad .
his enthusiasm to me would seem to imp@@ ly the opposite .
but one of Putin sum@@ med , sustainable chairs , showed that the State of Russia had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first one he mentioned in his demonstration : the down@@ ing of a Russian figh@@ ter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to time was w@@ reck@@ oned .
Putin made up and accused Ankara to please Russia in the back .
the going was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
the cous@@ in building again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months long the nation@@ ally controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed that the Tur@@ ks would pay for all the gu@@ ilt .
at the most serious , the alleg@@ ations of senior officials had benef@@ ited from the illegal oil @-@ trade in areas of Syria that is controlled by the Islamic State of the Islamic State .
he has denied this veh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward .
eventually this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erd@@ og@@ an the exc@@ use he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
Ankara lies with the advantages of a ceas@@ ef@@ ire obvious .
Erd@@ og@@ an is primarily used all friends who can get it after he was last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is decreased by nearly 90 % .
in Russia travel insurance and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when flights are res@@ umed .
you count on a late summer of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week forecast the state @-@ TV show cheap fruits and vegetables once the Turkish agr@@ arian imports will be allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulated it follows : &quot; tourists staying there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fu@@ ri@@ fu@@ eled on the West as it considers the reaction to the tried to im@@ pose a weak answer .
to this end , the continuing Gro@@ ll about the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ cht is to draw from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
Russian leader won in Ankara with certainty for ensuring that he sear@@ ched for elected state organs for elected state organs .
this is pleas@@ urable to Moscow in itself a self @-@ understanding that even has changed a profound fear of rain .
the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey , one how it once said to me a analy@@ st once , &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries , which viol@@ ates themselves from the West and feel bad and now f@@ encing .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two remaining .
the greatest difference is Syria where Moscow recently gave their role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey can help their antagon@@ istic sites .
it could signi@@ fies that after almost three hours of first talks , both Presi@@ dents met on the press conference that they had not even touched the subject .
the president of Turkey Compl@@ ete it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ il@@ ities - and given the potential for a perfect dispute as the NATO member of Turkey requested the Russian figh@@ ter jet , it is certainly better that the two leaders talked at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Bank R@@ BS brand , the R@@ BS brand will to be reduced more to a back office .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
ROSS Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand were associated with the global ambitions of the Bank .
the Bank has since been dis@@ soci@@ ate until eight years ago it had to be nearly col@@ oll@@ ed and saved .
in this time we have used brand names &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end @-@ cra@@ fts@@ men brands .
they supported the international sport with millions pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now she has decided to put more national brands into the spot@@ light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all r@@ s@@ b references are headquarters , the de@@ centr@@ alised head@@ quarter and the IP@@ O to change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a meeting tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand r@@ s@@ b becomes our Invest@@ ors mar@@ ke as well as the brand , among which our employees will be busy since we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now , we are not able to pursue any global goals , but to pursue local goals .
each of these brands will be in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the clients among these brands .
R@@ BS already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and will increase the perception of the various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop in the bank of brands because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the officers .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see lots of changes .
we can get these brands again , so I think that the time has come .

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori was on Friday its 3.@@ 000@@ ten British profit at New@@ market .
he put on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track a milestone in his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year Italian Itali@@ ans is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat @-@ race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ day winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who lived on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it is to happen at New@@ market because I am living here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he cat@@ ching the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the reti@@ red 20 @-@ mal@@ ine winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached over 4,@@ 300 wins in a recru@@ iting career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ an had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Car@@ rier@@ esi@@ sts
Frank@@ ie is one of the best co@@ aches of moder@@ nity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone so few in front of it reached .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tacti@@ cal intelle@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes it from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusiastic fans for years for this kind of sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already taken 6,000 prizes if he was not just a weekend and grand@@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has been ri@@ dden on the UK nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celeb@@ rates the milestone with a typical Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mount
from Fl@@ ying Fin@@ ishes to Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British flat building for two decades .
it was nerve @-@ wr@@ acking .
quite a series of great tur@@ ni@@ ers , including its famous &quot; glorious Seven &apos; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago he had difficulties , when he returned from his six months , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his order .
and he is still far from the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin mo@@ ist Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has advised his professor , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the nar@@ rated Trust prize of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed for the special officer for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin has arranged without the reason &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov &apos;s responsibilities as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a substitute member since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the prestigious President of Moscow International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the message of Tokyo .
on the site of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later to the executive chef and the Office of the government of government .
about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thanks for your trust . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your activities as a state of laws and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivan@@ ov that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the busi@@ est fi@@ sts Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet intelligence services , the K@@ GB .
as a staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men accepted that the staff of the staff at their own wish .
but despite the äch@@ el@@ ns for the cameras , here are only a few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is the consequence of a kind of power fight ?
this is currently no one .
but the official argument - that a man who was once praised as a potential president , on once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead on great sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ cism .
in his remarks about Putin , who were quot@@ ed on the site of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to trust every post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Minister of Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin &apos;s former member of the national security officer K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the B@@ und@@ essi@@ ch@@ erh@@ ism ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed to the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his Deputy Chairman .
when Putin gave power to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted .
once was thought that Ivan@@ ov could have been President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second mandate as a third presidential term had existed against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , closest ally , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister , before he became the president three and a half years later .

Queens@@ ferry - Cros@@ sing : bridge now with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion in the project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the que@@ ens ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four con@@ cluding the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the check@@ up section of Fi@@ fe has now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 s@@ lash parts .
the £ 1,35 billion in the project is to be completed by May 2017 .
economic sm@@ ister Keit@@ h Brown takes a visit today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineering with a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with over 30,000 tonnes concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the multip@@ lies between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the inc@@ endi@@ ble activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total seeds at their place and the last part of the Dec@@ ks is today won in Ros@@ y@@ th a prayer for the deck , which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its square .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first reference represents a significant milestone in each direction .
in this fantastic project the closure of forward @-@ looking high@@ - and deep @-@ construction is .
after installing the last street section and its connection with it in the expansion of the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap in the north or country side .
this was reached by pul@@ ling the northern bo@@ oms a 700 milli@@ meter south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive work .
massive , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 meters long is , approx . 6,000 tons weighs and at a slope of approx . 3 % to the top had to be drawn up .
heal , because the toler@@ ances who work on which the team was working , tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; saving in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after being thrown away from her fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at station suggested on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties swim in security while their boat was moving from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat in its proximity to turn around and put the worst in front of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds is already b@@ lown out of their reach until we left water &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ man , whereas the third man in the age of 60 were exhausted and hanging at a Bo@@ je without lif@@ egu@@ ards .
they came all on board the shore gu@@ ots and were brought back to the rescue station .
Mr Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still be alive .
the boat motor has a not@@ stop@@ over , but this del@@ etes the bot of the bot with the d@@ bot of the person who controlled the boat .
someone has awak@@ ened over these men today .
difficult hurt - man reli@@ es on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly inju@@ red .
as the police rus@@ hed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year old had gotten the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things .
instead he dis@@ sec@@ ted the alco@@ ve perpet@@ rators the clothes of his ex @-@ friend .
when this one came to the apartment they came to them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was inju@@ red by the hand and in the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother .
this al@@ arm@@ ament as a result of his sister .
together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore they went with their livel@@ i@@ ards from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ habitats of the male .
when the two women wo@@ ke the apartment again , s@@ ub@@ ust of the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and hold his ex @-@ friend .
who is building Braunschweig Switzerland ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green party : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should bring much more attention to the future in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to react to bad news that you will lose nearly 1300 apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hand@@ held concept for &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet contro@@ vers@@ y is programm@@ ed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments really ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Group leader Christoph Brat@@ mann means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in future must be 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built in stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the great issue in the city hall is , but Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does one deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to invest that investors on such areas are at least 10 per cent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing program , which will cost millions of costs and will still be financed to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left still wants tough@@ er runs for investors .
regardless of what gra@@ b , v@@ ane is a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the residential market .
will the device concept put into effect , this will provide for additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the workers .
but the program does not exist : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
how do you compare the loss of more about 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments whose promotion will run over the coming years ?
only up to the year 2020 there will be 500 flats .
to avoid this , as the planning @-@ policy spokes@@ woman of Nicole Palm , should now be bought by the city now .
moreover , it would have to be thought to pick apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the West town .
on one fell sw@@ oop , the problem can solve .
because in the West town , the end of the year dates back to the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of cheap apartments there .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social apartments in the west town is again dra@@ stically increased , one is removed from the target of so @-@ called di@@ version .
there is no longer a concentration of social @-@ weak within a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there will still be movement in discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what is not to say is that not yet a compromise can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenagers and child to play no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on scre@@ ens , scre@@ ens in the last decade of many be@@ aments .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go there is about getting people from the sofa and to become more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were first created for the video games that were first created for the video games ( later created from this a sign series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenomena in Pop@@ culture , the interest in the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July are somewhat .
the launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon was a lot more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who are tr@@ acked with a GPS as soon as they were once found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( about a screens@@ hot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , the 35.@@ 000 users re@@ trac@@ ed , the Washington Post recently received that within two days of launch of the game , the number of sur@@ vey@@ ed people , which exercise every day 30 minutes , ranging from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance enhancement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walk from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get active in the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are boring and come from people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ evaluated .
who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances of suffering to cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weigh@@ ting control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that you have fun .
thus three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people make even new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always there are m@@ aces , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to ?
it has become a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone Apps , like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity before , they have no reason to exercise sports as it does this play .
the new will lose its fri@@ ction , and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games to join the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and helping many people on hunting , active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the D@@ ament@@ ur@@ ns

Simone Bil@@ es is on all the immense .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
ef@@ fort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on gan@@ zer line brilli@@ antly .
and now finally the Olympi@@ as .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast@@ ics en@@ cl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the multi @-@ kamp@@ ft@@ it@@ el and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
your overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 has been clearly before the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ als@@ sk@@ amer@@ ica A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ med@@ al , Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the pig @-@ beam during the Olympic Winter Festival at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ ly is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual amer@@ ican , who wins a multi @-@ kamp@@ ft@@ it@@ el and a total of the fifth , while they are f@@ avo@@ red to their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
it broke out in tears when their final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
this success puts it in the same league like unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ ly , the last three years has domin@@ ates its kind of sport , 15 World Championships - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ ad of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it expected to be a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ ly and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations .
not having a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas returns , would be considered as disappointment .

although Bil@@ es consisted , during their long way down to the top , never planned to have the future , this is not really true .
part of their soil exercises - which contain its typical tum@@ bling passport - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and adopted by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school@@ ing in the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became in force .
she has not lost a multi @-@ competition competition since summer 2013 , a winner series that will continue as long as it wishes .

Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gentle as they expected her end to be - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears flowing on Bil@@ es gl@@ oss red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collective book , for reality .
the Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .

after her ground exercise , they thre@@ w the audience Kus@@ sh@@ alls , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , it has quickly expanded , so that the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning at the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass dec@@ ay shot at the car in the car
according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot , which were killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade during the first mass strike of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and hearing music .
Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis subsidiary Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators of a handful of fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then flew with another vehicle , is in the report to read .
the police shared with that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder could not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker took not the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which took possession of one of the adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher von Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ots turned the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at whether it connects with four previous attacks .
altogether , mostly in his@@ panic urban@@ iz@@ ations were killed in nine months in nine attacks , and two others were wo@@ unded .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , divided Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month with .
it is thought that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown ni@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW born from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refuse to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed because of her injury and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died yet on the spot .
a witness shared the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ able car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , who dropped off on an empty p@@ up truck for half an hour before the triple murder , and from which it is assumed that it was the work of mass mur@@ ders .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age and cast a bul@@ b from the seat as well as the frag@@ ments from the engine space .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the singing , toys and of course its mother .
but as the least of his retirement has Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that did not know his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I managed not .
I don &apos;t manage this .
I did not let myself in this respect .
what is not true at all -- naturally one has left to it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund you never can recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do it , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto .
Ed@@ mund is able to run with the aid of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund was able to neither sit or scr@@ at@@ ite up to his third year , and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and biking .
he likes to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth presents the drawing language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him po@@ inter @-@ language at , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical drawing language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented several characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it is to affect the life of those infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of a certain future .
I always asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I have no longer asked for pre@@ diction for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to tell me someone really .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful Council for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects that were caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near D@@ enh@@ am Springs , who are both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to reach over the weekend record level .
the Met@@ as@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could be flood@@ ed in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a stub@@ born flood@@ ing in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger since these are used over the true rivers only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .

it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford , that she lived there in the 48 years in which she had never seen such a high @-@ level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and it would be the only one that can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ per would have saved every three in a large military truck and brought them to the next Feuer@@ wache in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated to Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood@@ ing has quickly expanded , since there were still severe rains and that the authorities ev@@ acu@@ ating ev@@ acu@@ ation evidence .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has under@@ gone a lot , his small body was crossed by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the Sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boy shared the station with that he is likely to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot at German@@ town .
in addition , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
the boy was found on the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical state , reported spot@@ ted on the transm@@ itter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are determined whether under one of the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
pat@@ ron@@ age for storm @-@ gro@@ ve , which were trac@@ ed to various assault ri@@ ds , s@@ se@@ wn the scene .
it seems that it was clearly a clear battle for this .
on the road , on both sides of the walk , we found cover .
in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters to have been involved , who were very active , shared with the police and the police in Philadelphia with the radio station .
there are also several houses and vehicles taken in the area .
it came to no forti@@ fied and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ sm@@ ug@@ gling arm when she played in front of her house in the residential district of the West O@@ ak Lane .
they recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ on and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I pre@@ mier@@ es in Tur@@ ns in Tur@@ ns and that is more than one reason .
first , I have been working in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ on Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who taught for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ o@@ lics in , round , makes every pride .
this team is finally reflected in the US .
it has paved the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one below the female gymn@@ ast .
last year we were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ on was celeb@@ rating a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and America .
now , the world was able to witness witness the incredible performance of the triple world cup in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they wa@@ ited un@@ wa@@ ited , but the master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ on@@ ins .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual amer@@ ican , who won gold on an individual multi @-@ battle event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are witn@@ essing the tip of this sport , but we don &apos;t see the classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ on and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the ol@@ ymp@@ ic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympi@@ am@@ anna will have only four tur@@ rets in the team . besides this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is so that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and tur@@ ner man@@ ship primarily in private gy@@ ms that will be maintained for training , marketing , competition , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued .
the majority of these trainers lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner will receive its entire training and that is a de@@ duc@@ tive and long @-@ term engagement .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes , since they started with the gymn@@ asi@@ es .
we need to be inspired by the congreg@@ ations of inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls , which are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a well @-@ being and more accessible turn@@ around .
I have founded my gym with 20 years ago .
at my events we have free and affordable tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,@@ 000 urban people ( especially black and his@@ panic ) provided and national and international winners .
in September we are expanding to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great ol@@ ymp@@ ic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline , and determination to the spirit .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who brings thousands of young girls to care for the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that is great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the ol@@ ymp@@ ic Mann@@ schafts@@ gol@@ ds and thanks , F@@ ass you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to get healthy , strong and successful young women .
Assist@@ enz@@ ler would like to organise further strikes after she refused Jerem@@ y H@@ unts proposal
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes through the adoption of a reform of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assist@@ ants who voted upon a choice , they refused him .
in July , Hunt plans to introduce the contract to introduce the contract , and said the N@@ HS to be harmful in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and that any further delay to the people and patients would be harmful .
the first assistant should receive a new contract , the changes to night and weekend work , to improve the care of healthy movements .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the b@@ ma comm@@ iss@@ ees for assist@@ ants were the last night in a message with : &quot; assist@@ ants to the proposed contract still serious concerns , in particular that it will deal with the current staff crisis and administ@@ ered to all doctors . &quot;
for only eight weeks , which remain even until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , the progress has to be made and the time is running out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by b@@ ma to resolve disputes arising from discussions have to participate in the government and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hunt had done last month in the last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must act now , raise the pre@@ condition and speak the concerns of the assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do this , so it was clear that the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to perform further workers &quot; actions .
the last strike in late April saw a sur@@ ge of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 terminals , since the nur@@ ses and specialist doctors were included to provide physicians on the strike @-@ post@@ cards .
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over changes through an acceptance of the reform of the British Medical Association .
the b@@ ma wants a better final re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4,000 Assist@@ enz@@ ologists who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employee , called for the assistant to end the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working measures won &apos;t reach anything of the only little but had already over@@ loaded teams and service providers , and prepare the patient , en@@ leg@@ is@@ ers and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the comm@@ ee of the assist@@ ants and with the Ministry of Health , and other minist@@ ries has responded positively to concerns about the pre@@ m@@ und@@ y and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ ings .
the employers hop@@ ed that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who were of a vocational training , training courses and gender equality in medicine - a sign of how serious it became the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health , regarding compliance with the b@@ ma in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day can reduce the cardi@@ ac ar@@ tery
thousands of heart attack are benef@@ ited from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after the authorities advised to adopt this more people for an extended period of time .
the ger@@ inn@@ ess drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for people with a de@@ ar@@ tery disease .
the drug is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the regul@@ ator NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS is recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regul@@ ator NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS is recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of this suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
cardi@@ ac ar@@ du@@ cts and stroke are caused by anonymis@@ ed fatty material in the arter@@ ies , the fittings form .
when the Bel@@ ag breaks , it may cause a blood cl@@ ot which suff@@ ice the blood@@ stream until the heart and thus causes a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ot is solved , it can flow through the blood flow and flowing flow to brain , which causes a stroke .
individuals who have already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to have another .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca that is distributed under the merch@@ ant Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ auses .
the ass@@ ass@@ ination of NI@@ CE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of NI@@ CE Health Study Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of sec@@ tari@@ anism , one quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or stroke - often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed coron@@ ary heart can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attack and stroke cases with people who had already had a heart attack .
by a pro@@ visional recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are glad that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood @-@ risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the settlement procedure recommends no treatment that is going beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ y leaves the elec@@ tor@@ ment in Muslim regions
the former mayor of the Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was last year on dism@@ iss@@ al of a government reported due to corruption from the ministry
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ i has led to that widespread elec@@ tor@@ ment in Muslim communities are ignor@@ ant like a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet of Sir Eric Pic@@ cles is pic@@ tured by the police , election and Rath@@ dic@@ s to have ignored the evidence of election abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over @-@ sensitivity to ethics and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now an anti @-@ corrupt government , said that the police should be permitted from religious mot@@ if@@ s from religious mot@@ if@@ s so that the police should be permitted to initi@@ ate distr@@ action outside of elec@@ toral acc@@ ab@@ ine to be inti@@ mid@@ ated voters .
he recommends that voters should have a reference to demonstrate in elections their identity .
at present a vot@@ er must just call its name and address .
the report proposes that not even inf@@ eri@@ ble ink on the finger of a person when they give her election voice to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should obtain more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official comm@@ issions or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against elec@@ toral fraud , but also the local government in front of the wider cord and financial fraud that goes to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets elec@@ toral candidate in eastern London .
last year , a special court decided that the acting Mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man came to a lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt the illegal practices of his ministry .
the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on the cy@@ ni@@ cal way , and that he would have brought his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bia for silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ous duty of Muslims to vote him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation , where a person cho@@ oses than someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the entire country .
he vo@@ iced in particular al@@ arm@@ ing for fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent brief@@ ing - where the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the joining of out to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in its report it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as evidence was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was applied , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ en@@ ched background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such conduct such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the eth@@ ni@@ cism and religion would have been ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choices &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires tough@@ er registration ver@@ i@@ fications to prevent the elec@@ toral directory on imports and welfare purposes .
consider options , voters in front of the choice for your selection .
not even removed ink on the finger of a person when she has given her voice to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic aud@@ itions on the nation@@ ality of a person perform to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on request to a automatic letter code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pro@@ hibition that political activists will be working in full letter and envel@@ opes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police give the authority to initi@@ ate elec@@ toral stations .
a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indic@@ t@@ ment for inti@@ mid@@ ation under the repression of the People Act 1983 ( National Council Regulation 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing offered in voting stations .
request that only English must be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of training to ensure that employees will rule en@@ force that voters want to go alone into the elec@@ toral cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no sanctions was shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vote of the election was Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was sufficiently well known for a number of reasons - according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the real &quot; ab@@ h@@ ak@@ checks &quot; of the elec@@ toral membership of the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Last part in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
our country contributes as the mother of the parli@@ aments , a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of several authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .

on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald in the show and tried to justify his observation , by saying that it was not his intention that she is designed as a personal attack .

buyer in Pri@@ mark weigh@@ ed on woman who tried in the middle of business under@@ wear under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to watch , when a woman moved her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try sub@@ p@@ ants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , mu@@ ster@@ te she , as she saw it , she moved out and put it back into the shelf .
she went on and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone , an .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she turned back and left the shop without buy something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the st@@ alls , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the location , moved her own shr@@ ights and p@@ ants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tried not to find a slightly discreet place to do it - she was just there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; each har@@ dened , when they returned to the under@@ p@@ ants , that you obviously have not fallen , as they put them back to the shelf . &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three further under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that you fell apart and went down .
&quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b that she watched someone - or think about the person who would buy those sub@@ p@@ ants who had tried them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to think that someone would like to go back home who had a different person and have not been washed out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have got , the staff have tried to pull the clothes of the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants and figure out that another woman had att@@ ained them and out and they were not washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; when you move away from the back then you should turn around yourself as a st@@ acker , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move out of the pl@@ aster , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
take the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ b@@ ows .
hit him then with the knee into the ly@@ re and rot@@ ate you while the ag@@ gress@@ ors are scr@@ apped before p@@ ains , the weapon from his hands . suggest it with the run into the face and move back , while they set the weapon upon it .
with ag@@ gress@@ ors that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the fire@@ line , gra@@ b the gun and turn them , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon simultaneously and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of his grip , before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon upon it .
sounds difficult ?
take a look at the video to see exactly how it Miz@@ ra@@ chi makes .
but remember that it is at the saf@@ est on the saf@@ est to transfer your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right incl@@ ined for a guide to his tongue at the most dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller ex@@ ogen@@ ic his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ le@@ x a serious examination - by giving some of the dirty and det@@ ained places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k swit@@ ched his course on a euro @-@ shadow , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dishwasher on a Zug@@ toil@@ ette as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resi@@ li@@ ency of his immune system .
in front of the le@@ aking of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he will fit .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; , brought some surprising results to day@@ light .
the thought , the dish@@ kno@@ b set off a Zug@@ toil@@ ette , which has already been used by thousands of others , but actually reside in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and medical experts about the promotion of gut bacteria and their own health .
fortunately , there was nothing , what he spec@@ kl@@ ed , more than one bad fo@@ ret@@ aste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was well known to test the resi@@ li@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by visiting the world and ate wonderful things as well .
from public funds to train stations up to dish@@ was@@ p of toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample
in the movie he told me : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in film he became aware of his reputation in any case .
the only thing he used was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test @-@ line showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ m of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ates is fresh @-@ washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to s@@ lick , after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ms over 4000 units was , while fresh washed hands one of less than 60 have .
Mr W@@ right and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &apos; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial stra@@ ins in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is coming to the worst thing that I have put in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will not stop here because it is in@@ duc@@ ted here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company furn@@ ish Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us that includes both l@@ actic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Niko Vu@@ s@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , with that made that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers for more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , which led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me say it so - I could have arous@@ ed my respect for Ian , which I had to rely on him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to blow up it and others , with which it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad we have recorded some of these dirty deeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of the survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us , especially with the well being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said they are at least occasionally use products that contain lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us .

a as@@ o@@ dical family left her social apartment after a delic@@ acy with a loss of £ 5@@ 0,000 because they had wre@@ cked their neighbors .
Tanya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Salt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were cap@@ itali@@ zed from their estate , found sho@@ cked the residence of the housing @-@ oper@@ and domin@@ ate the property in a mis@@ par@@ able condition .
the walls instruc@@ ted holes on , wooden se@@ els were ri@@ pped up , tr@@ l was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were surrounded and it is thought that now she lives in a private accommodation now .
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who is working for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Chron@@ icle , said that she is afraid that the apartment had no more to repair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was for people here an absolute night@@ mare and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider when this estate is pres@@ um@@ ably regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is in@@ famous and its reputation is it also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror , whom the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , street fight with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ers , drug abuse , drug @-@ abuse and excessive scre@@ ens , stretching and cur@@ ri@@ gs covered .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got a arrangement for the iso@@ zi@@ al behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that will under circumstances be demol@@ ished , ancient tr@@ ash was found
they were sold in the estate in which drugs were trad@@ ed in the past , the wood@@ di@@ ri@@ mp were ri@@ pped up .
neighbours told that she had to fight her on the street and regularly issued the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall Chron@@ icle she and her partner this week rolled away from the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to draw up voluntarily .
the del@@ ines were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours that said that their lives were made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were not talking to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood there because it was so quiet here - we are not familiar !
now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patrick , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Chron@@ ology , said that it failed to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the s@@ acr@@ al side of the community @-@ house , tr@@ ash and old toys were dis@@ car@@ ded
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the ten@@ ant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , because there is always the last step to take into consideration the Corn@@ wall Chron@@ icle Housing Project ;
this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds for their neighbours were aw@@ ful .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have been cour@@ ageous and have sent us the information .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbors and the message con@@ veys that ant@@ iso@@ ci@@ ales behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patrick said that all three sons were living at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 .

Skel@@ don received a fine after being found guilty of possession of a drug of class B in trading supervision .
they claimed the money for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 with an automobile accident .
having been without shelter , it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ymouth .
lots of rooms of the house were vali@@ dated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will de@@ em ten@@ ants that do not hold off at the order form
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared with a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not hold the order of the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can take themselves without self @-@ care as well as those who were har@@ med by such a behavior &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have done it as expected in the end game and made the title among each other .
there@@ with , it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese title would fetch a single title in the sign of Five rings .
last Not @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia St@@ ages was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were on the record alone , between the sent@@ ences and in time @-@ outs , they had no co@@ aches .
they with@@ drawn to the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their tr@@ ench in fair competition alone each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mat@@ ches until here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump sm@@ elt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; giant problems ″ in the elec@@ toral campaign &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership of the US rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in the traditionally con@@ serv@@ atives states to address their majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump has given weaknesses of its election campaign to the Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ut@@ ah &apos;s Republi@@ can &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rare moment , in which usually large sp@@ uri@@ g and self @-@ confident m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire &apos;s something like concerns vo@@ iced as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the separate Republi@@ can camp of the race , there will now be a question of his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ik@@ al Christians that he asked to support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blame is false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he took back his well @-@ known media .
Republi@@ can High bur@@ ns W@@ ack@@ ets
Ut@@ ah is usually a safe bank for the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ enc@@ ils by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ aled .
other institutes see trails in the front , but not by the distance that are common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
as endangered also applies to Arizona and Georgia .
in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC answered Tr@@ ump on the question as he wants to stop the march Clin@@ ics : &quot; just as I have done it before . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is doing nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth to tell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not come up for him at the end for the sake of political correctness , be it right , said Tr@@ ump continues .
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump must have been threatened with funds to support his elec@@ toral campaign , he should not be able to present no better surveys . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of this , one wants to engage the candidates of the Republi@@ can for the Congress stronger under the arms .
Olympia : triple sc@@ am for d@@ oping test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a discipl@@ in@@ arian Commission .
Ken@@ ias Leicht@@ ath@@ l@@ eten threat@@ ens after the second d@@ oping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud @-@ attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee shared with , as soon as a discipl@@ in@@ ative Commission , in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ ian@@ ical Func@@ tion@@ ist had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre cable F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was handed over .
this is the team @-@ line Ken@@ ias reported by the d@@ oping @-@ Kont@@ rol@@ le@@ uren .
the World Association IAAF has created the IO@@ C to provide information about the case in order to see his own investigations , divided a IAAF spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IO@@ C , the IAAF can make a review , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it was in a IAAF declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the d@@ oping time and has signed itself as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the sample was given and signed , &quot; stated Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p so@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in the possession of the ac@@ cred@@ itation of athletes , who stood on the list for training contacts in the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in the Beijing World Cup capacity over 800 metres .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics , Michael Rot@@ ich was de@@ duc@@ ted by the Rio @-@ Games .
he is intended to have informed against cash payments of his country on cont@@ our d@@ oping test .
media reporting that he should have been arrested by Nairobi on his return at the airport of Nairobi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kenya is at the IO@@ C in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; race for some time already in particular observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the announcement of the IO@@ C introduced more than 2000 d@@ oping targets before the Rio Olympics , it was apparently noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into the visa .
the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a consequence , W@@ ada went to Kenya from the list of countries whose d@@ oping should fight against the rules of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ada &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the land won the cup of medals at the World Cup 2015 in Peking .
in a series of TV reporting the ARD were ever raised again , that in Kenya d@@ oping means are readily available and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport .
IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had provided them in the Russian athle@@ tics Men .
in this context it could be proven that in this sport @-@ wide and systematic ins@@ ulated .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics period were removed from the summer &apos;s playing excluded .

we always say that it is shaped very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging plays Bart@@ oli an older @-@ d Maria .
she reminds with melan@@ chol@@ y to her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally unusual !
and then there were Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I feel Pret@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passi@@ on@@ ately .
&quot; they resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Dud@@ amel is full of lob@@ bies : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a tremendous gener@@ ously .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Dud@@ amel is so an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ d is for him a necessity .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it &apos;s such a huge opportunity to share these musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , this is very important in all !
for the American film@@ maker Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; top @-@ up : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today , we have the refugees , then the d@@ olls were gone to New York and the New York inhabitants did not want it .
they are the same topics , and they are today just as meaningful as they were then .

in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ men from the east of London went to a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .

but instead of famous naked people she would like to find the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 .
the editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his N@@ aked @-@ magazine from Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boy distingu@@ is@@ hable as &quot; Play@@ boy for males . &quot;
I make this for women .
apparently , it seems that it is the case of Calendar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the representation of tim@@ eless and classic neck , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for publication of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful artwork .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open Cast@@ ing Call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish Church is counting on Mass Dest@@ ination
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not adap@@ ts and Erd@@ og@@ an , sitting on packed caffeine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the presidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kur@@ dish Community of Germany expects a short @-@ term refu@@ ges from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundreds of thousands &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the President &apos;s President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the harsh proceeding of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after Putin &apos;s deliber@@ ation , the Kur@@ dish Community was expecting a mass cur@@ sed to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with ten thousand , medium @-@ term stag@@ nat@@ ing from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues fighting minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government already passed in short @-@ term high bur@@ ners with criminal actions , be 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the put@@ ted put@@ sch , sec@@ ular and opposition ethnic towers .
many will begin to start in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a country belonging to himself refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association def@@ endant the targeted adaptation of the Syrian Arab Republic in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ arian cities .
so that Erd@@ og@@ an wants to boost the travelling pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ian and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out or distributed over the past hundred years , said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP urged that the federal government are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his followers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ ch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel the first time in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement also fears the flight of many doors abroad .
more Tur@@ ks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ ists .
the fire @-@ market as a Gü@@ len supporters , teachers and other academ@@ ics are the professional existence .
&quot; who@@ ever does not adap@@ ts and Erd@@ og@@ an , sitting on packed caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and Sä@@ kul@@ aren , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot;
as the newspaper referred to appeal on figures of the Federal Ministry of Education , Tur@@ ks already presented the biggest group in Germany from the coup as a member of political persecution recognised in Germany .
on June 30 , this may be 11 / 11 people and thus under 29 percent of all as as@@ yl@@ ates ( 39.@@ 625 ) had been justified .
in this survey do not refer to war , poverty or fu@@ tility fre@@ est@@ ing .
asylum entitled according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. , from the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ party , individually .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where there will be , where it w@@ eh@@ n &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia may not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2021 will not be held once again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament decided already at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for bl@@ ö@@ der than so far it is not : summer Holidays , heat and land @-@ sw@@ on@@ ic@@ ature - that h@@ ates itself .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election , are on vacation .
most of the tourists who are in the country on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen , or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country .
these include practical problems : in the holidays are assistant , the post@@ ers b@@ lows , ballo@@ on , fl@@ avo@@ red , and count on the end of voices to pres@@ cribe only pain@@ stak@@ oll .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to say once again in the election to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and there is also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 are the strongest party , now lies in surveys behind the CD@@ U .
thr@@ illing is how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ le si@@ lic@@ ed and what remains at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ing aug@@ ust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous elec@@ toral campaign , one sees from his grand@@ children .
he travels through the country , distributed and chat a little with the people , just as it also has its legendary predecessor , Harald Ring@@ ram .
otherwise , sailors have received cold hands and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the bl@@ aming of the Af@@ rod@@ ite of Af@@ rod@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have acceler@@ ated the rise of justice lists , which will probably cost him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fine office &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its nickname , the Minister of the Lorenz Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced how it is when you are at the right place at the right place for the wrong time .
she has invited her ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel at large numbers ; Merkel ( German Bundestag ) has been on the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is a p@@ ity not to listen to someone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel listen .
otherwise the northeast CD@@ U disp@@ enses with the usual voting conditions on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , so , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has marked that you cr@@ um@@ bling the base in the country that she needs to be very hard to find a wire to the people again .
you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , in the times of the country barely any .
the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ Elec@@ ted Co@@ ordin@@ ate to his collabor@@ ators is also self @-@ liber@@ ating : &quot; they need to go where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wedding , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because a lot is at stake , cel@@ ing has now called its SPD to a particularly ambitious election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last nearly 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the after@@ ward ( 19 ) .
in 2011 the SPD had still won a clear 6 percent prior to the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small @-@ party , with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should allow the leap into the land@@ day .
they make out of the holiday @-@ need a modern virtu@@ e and place their choices on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Contin@@ ent Claudia Müller &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green pol@@ l campa@@ ign@@ ed for a search @-@ search for native stim@@ uli among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t exactly with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the mec@@ y@@ rian lakes and find it still beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ San@@ ation : Gast@@ sta@@ etten suffer from sper@@ son
at the speed , with which the B 27 is re@@ constructed , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for building work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8 pm , there are all@@ enth@@ al@@ ben praise .
&quot; they have done everything fairly well , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the jet gas station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be postpon@@ ed at weekends to mid @-@ time plan@@ ing to the south , until the end of October everything should be ready .
ob@@ tain@@ able is also the de@@ ed of the persons responsible for the construction work , e.g. when it comes to the establishment of accommodation reservations .
since the construction site took place on Monday to the south and also the lock@@ out of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is back , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
the citizens can now take part from the Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 .
the emig@@ ration to the place seems to be returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some of some serious discomfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the responsible leader responsible for the transport @-@ technical management of the reconstruction of Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ ters@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ nerst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many v@@ eils are sear@@ ched and familiar to their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age .
what this led to man@@ tra @-@ trucks in living areas .
as the speed limit can not be met , the community always decided to sing the vehicle &apos;s vehicle from mos@@ h@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable exce@@ eding &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says King , who made himself informed about the situation itself on site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been scr@@ apped already .
the fastest was with 77 hours @-@ kilometers at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 there is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg is now open the street again .
business people do not have to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ San@@ die has led to them to sales @-@ bro@@ ods , every one you asked to look through .
however , some more and some are less concerned .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customers , so for other companies , for whom the renov@@ ations has hardly consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Auto@@ haus Mai@@ er speaks Thomas Sul@@ z from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also a fact that naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most exploited are the locations along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly the crown , will find clear words .
this is already existence @-@ threatening .
not only him , but all the restaurants have made it &quot; hard . &quot;
it failed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we will have to be glad about each Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue is aimed at winning sales to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking had its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have released it .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , politics would have responded differently .
instead , government President Jörg Schmidt at a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , otherwise , the hospitality benef@@ itted otherwise from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now they also took the dis@@ advantages that sur@@ ge itself through the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other land@@ ings , where such a little gener@@ ously have been trad@@ ed .
in all the pl@@ agues , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his host is continuing .
after all , family business has been based since 17@@ 15 , where he refers to the long history of history .
that other regular guests are now paying less frequently because of the complicated traffic control , it may understand .
if you can not come down , it is also elsewhere .
that its stem cli@@ ent@@ el after the end of the refurb@@ ishment has returned , because G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with B@@ SE and bir@@ ders , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his cli@@ ent@@ ele of the greatest crisis which has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction , this is already brutal .
constantly , in the name of the fight against laws is bol@@ ted .
after the recent attacks , the Minister of Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick@@ er safety package .
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ al@@ ition@@ ers say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the Performance of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are calling for anyone .
other , additional points would initially be discussed within the parties .
also , I took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an interior Minister , however , be located in results and on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commercial consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Co@@ alition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has made a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the fall was all the more extensive .
some is already known , announce that a new security authority has to worry about Kn@@ aking encryp@@ ted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines for air @-@ passenger data and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the safety authorities is also not surprising .
partly starts de Mai@@ zi@@ ère a second suggestion for proposals made with the SPD so far : he wants to pose a symptom of terrorist groups amongst punishment and ji@@ ha@@ dists with double citi@@ zenship with double citi@@ zenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spatial the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still ret@@ ains this for reasonable and demanding even anything that does not have any chance in the co@@ habit@@ ee .
a few new ideas presented at Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they have in part in itself : he plans for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people before exp@@ ul@@ sion .
refugees trying to respond directly into the country to launch their smartphones and disclose social media @-@ accounts for a safety verification .
in Dul@@ c@@ als for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to raise some worse than before - about those who commit crimes or their papers to conce@@ al their identity .
some of this is political and legally sensitive .
some also still un@@ equi@@ po@@ res and leaves questions open .
and in some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - raises the question : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be dealt with in agreement that the Att@@ ent@@ ä@@ ter of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were .
in addition , many people were worried about the high refugee figures about security .
and things that are deeply concerned , let &apos;s not sp@@ out the time in election times .
the inner safety is enormous into the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attack in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the cont@@ est@@ ing is great .
and yes , there is election struggles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD bring up internal security and therefore increasingly on position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days there went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ter dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a safety @-@ policy @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ interior ministers , in which the Ress@@ ources also call on a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition and a revers@@ al of the double citi@@ zenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also here to conc@@ il@@ able notes .
from a revers@@ al of the double @-@ pass he may consider nothing .
we have for@@ ged the discussion in Germany .
it is new to open , be not reasonable .
and on a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition he has constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is constitu@@ ent at all corners and whether it is indeed &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ al@@ ition@@ ers , it has to be seen yet .
there is a lot of penet@@ rated what could provide for arguments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to prof@@ iling the theme of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ ing Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled first ahead of his talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ pf@@ lich is still through .
despite diesel @-@ sc@@ and@@ als the payout percentage rise around the world .
but not in all markets it is running round .
there is also a term in the recall campaign .
Volkswagen starts delivering the disp@@ at@@ ches in the second half @-@ year .
Europe &apos;s largest automobile buil@@ ders can count on this year in the course of the year despite the diesel ones , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ going markets .
but in July the core mar@@ ke VW especially weak@@ ened in Western Europe and thus resi@@ sted the overall sale as the company shared in the D@@ ax .
the brand sold VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s prior year .
in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market for sales of 14 per cent below the previous year &apos;s year .
in the home market Germany un@@ used the disp@@ at@@ ches around almost a six @-@ sixth .
trademarks Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the we@@ aker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there have been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic parameters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a Spre@@ cher@@ in .
in the U.S. , where the gas@@ bure@@ tor first escal@@ ated , is also further a min@@ us to be@@ ech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , the mainly affected home market of the Lower Saxony is already farther , due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an exc@@ use of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
consolidated sales of Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show off from January to July from January to July .
1,3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had mani@@ fold with a software comp@@ art@@ ment .
in Germany alone , VW calls for some 2.5 million vehicles to expand into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fit VW , VW , that the re@@ modeling of the cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power in any deteri@@ oration .
the automobile buil@@ ders set the customer after the conversion of a &quot; Guarant@@ ee &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel .
the cause of legal enemies .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen @-@ waters of its German customers are now a guarantee of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ted diesel models .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have confirmed this last Monday of VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Department of Transport , this meeting was confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen has the det@@ ention of my enquiry commission and to fulfill the full extent of KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or Motor@@ cycle , after the re @-@ equipment , no deteri@@ or@@ ations are held and all types @-@ approved vehicle levels have unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarant@@ e@@ eing an example of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarant@@ e@@ eing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , for example , a half year after the conversion to a workshop , and this could result in the new software , even if the damage is nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the customer interests , it is important to avoid that in any other damage , they have nothing to do with the g@@ ass@@ ad@@ andal they have nothing to do with regards to possible guarantees , as it meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands of rich le@@ as@@ parag@@ us in future pun@@ c@@ ers - as a second institute in Germany .
Bank President Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it is only about 139 customers who spends 40 million euros on tox@@ or or day@@ time . &quot;
the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher banks talks about one individual case and does not see it a signal : normal as@@ parag@@ us would have to have no fear of paying for their austerity law . &quot;
bearing banks money on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they need to pay their 0,4 percent criminal law .
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund from September of Privat@@ e- and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 Euro on gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ day dates back .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; said Paul .
he hat@@ ched 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not commerci@@ alise .
&quot; they are looking at the central bank account and do not cause 0,4 percent costs , &quot; said the Bank of Chief Executive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie for every million 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs will continue after the urs@@ day principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash can easily lie in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four inci@@ dents , I &apos;m not yet the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have had understanding and altern@@ ately on other plant forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operation of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB has caused significant costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are alone to bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
with pris@@ ons for deposits of three million euros had made the Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gian and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank of Alten@@ burger Land with their sk@@ ate @-@ stores in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , captain of the banking system , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients must pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see give it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cliff , which is equipped with a lot of l@@ ush property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank if it &apos;s free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely shar@@ per group .
there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older plate ers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time to spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog would follow a message report on TV , I would follow the camera , while in the middle of a busy road in Soh@@ o run , a hum@@ ble track record , and wild boun@@ ce , my hands can keep and something determining what : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ hos is slowly assigned to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where formerly independent sellers are located - there is still a handful of fantastic turn@@ tables specialities .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mix@@ es by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , which I S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , one woman , pres@@ um@@ ably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is it a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
this reson@@ ates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail ; I am not followed him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , the result of his available income : he is now able to purchase records , which he could not afford to buy them as they appeared , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late six@@ ties , early 70@@ ies who appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , when I was probably something too young to buy it , &quot; he says .
it is true that those who buy plates , are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and happy to spend time , and adds : &quot; I do not smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray believes that many customers that he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of folks that have been influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and see it again , to buy their old records .
by the talks I managed , people usually have escap@@ ed from their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once bought their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
that would be the boom of followers of the record revised flash of a particular age .
but what about the inn@@ onal emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica in order to detect that record stores a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customer calls for the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans can feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw from the stability of familiar actu@@ ators , objects , the happ@@ ier youth .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as collectors so I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; fl@@ ames a staff of a plate @-@ stack .
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not yet been heard .
the survey was also out that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player .
at this time of the news reports , I would probably look very worried , while I bl@@ aded by a stack on Bossa Nova Komp@@ il@@ itations .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( numbers : three men mid @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy as@@ pe@@ ct &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ al plate , so I can put it into a shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ loaded , less musical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older who will come up slowly .
stop that has devoted to the p@@ board nearly a whole floor has an open audience when I ro@@ e deer .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenage boys and women aged men .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the imagin@@ able stores - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester synth@@ esizer and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ er pop instead of experimental jazz mostly from speakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks quite lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ologically trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be adjustable if someone is standing next to someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs for several minutes in the shop and looks at the variation of sale available for sale .
it is more like a window inher@@ ited piece than a big one .
it does not deserve much , so the collectors of records is not a real option , she says .
it costs much .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it is driving with a loving si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of record de@@ bar@@ ter is to have inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the note that Je@@ ans @-@ hot@@ p@@ ants take , observe a group of young teenage boys , be@@ g for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a cros@@ sover turn@@ tables .
on the left is a stair@@ well , a wall full of records of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are only pure decorative , some are so far up that it is impossible to attach them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that each attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers might want to send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
there is no surprise that a population group which has more time and money than others , while the one is the most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research shows , that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the great number of female collectors and turn@@ tables , which exist in reality , record stores and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en , un@@ taken into account .
these people probably work hard at school or at office .
they spend their Thursday morning certainly not with the st@@ rolling through record stores of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while being m@@ apped with the rigi@@ d view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator who rag@@ ing over the shoulders of little sens@@ ory men .

French Court bor@@ row@@ ed an offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais , do@@ zens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live .
in court hearing this week , the authorities in Calais agreed that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell 72 pro@@ visional shops where people within the bearing goods , from cigar@@ ettes to end@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair services offer or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture de Calais argu@@ ed that these places are going to be crus@@ hed because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which a fire@@ side and soft@@ ening risks .
humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals provided by the state @-@ supported associations and other groups cannot provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also went out that the pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 pro@@ visional shops but ad@@ mits that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais will be absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of calm hits are between refugees and Vol@@ unte@@ ers .
one of the places that was threatened by defe@@ ats , the young Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers was operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the pet@@ ition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this children of a catastrophe would be the youngest eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s law@@ ns must adapt to the next generation speeds : in different federal states , inter alia in Hessen and Brandenburg , new light@@ ning tools are tested , which are to be particularly effectively over@@ run by the sound@@ proo@@ fs .
the fut@@ urist@@ ic effective En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used at ir@@ rig@@ th points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example on highway construction sites or to san@@ ction bridges with temporary template , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary blocks for compliance with speed limit .
a continuous mobile structure can be too dangerous or time @-@ consuming .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : his battery holds five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operations five days , the case data is encryp@@ ted via a mo@@ dem .
laser measurement technology can also be recorded all cars across several tracks at the same time .
variable speed limit , as well as flow from bot@@ e to time , strip and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the advanced condition you can move the p@@ endant loud manufacturer with any car with tow@@ bar .
so that it is not easy to cut off , it is lo@@ wer@@ ed in the brass , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and by the way also swe@@ pt out outside .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the b@@ itzer from Vand@@ alism .

great Britain holt Silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold takes up
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came last on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt halt at last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were marked with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji ables a master class at handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , push @-@ back , line @-@ line and ro@@ wer force to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ aille of any color .
defeat was turned off by the not too bad Tro@@ phy of silver med@@ al - British fourth over this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they sm@@ ashed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the B@@ oks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could be dropped to them in the final .
however , Fi@@ ji in this form could have made a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a sol@@ ace for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold med@@ al around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss @-@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago it lost in Ryan of every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here it is only one .
this work@@ book will be w@@ eh@@ ous@@ ed but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonder@@ full and made the attacks GB@@ s made of fun se@@ pr@@ all .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co . an , when you would run into driving b@@ usses . the World Series winners went to 5 @-@ 0 to top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai continued another attack on the right corner which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball bro@@ adly defined .
a prec@@ arious rag@@ ing of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute l@@ ete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch@@ down , and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ fi@@ ff and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u prec@@ eded by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and rus@@ hed to the line to take a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji to be born to play the 7 , while I still have se@@ eded .
this is how it is .
GB lead to fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ian gap ... for whole four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half time , until Jos@@ ue Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a excell@@ ant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on launched an attempt to GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game ran for a long time in favor of Southern Europe &apos;s cons@@ ular , whose fans s@@ cars , flags and d@@ anced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
M@@ ata V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ cake with another attempt within the last seconds .
the wh@@ ist@@ le lo@@ wer@@ ed , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and the GB k@@ ick@@ ed crus@@ hing be@@ aten in the lawn .
earlier in the days Fi@@ ji Japan had conqu@@ ered Fi@@ ji Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and pressed South Africa in a cr@@ ack semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - the British transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the B@@ oks in the first half after the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ ed and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilliant bel@@ ated tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside team , secured the profit - and thus the silver med@@ al .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for the row@@ de@@ g
there will be no p@@ aler@@ ting gold than with these games and what will mean .
from the first rowing down to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if it were only those who sat at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ present as she saw the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row without head@@ bands in a row that laid the first women in the history of British sport that laid on such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 39.@@ ter were impro@@ per use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ inside who go@@ ose over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ge , which is not reflec@@ ting the nature of the tri@@ umph@@ s .
behind each gold in the Ru@@ ins there is a batt@@ ali@@ on willing to help make the difference and it was nobody assistant than the coach , who did not know if he was able to survive this day when cancer was diagnosed .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had wind @-@ cancer who is oper@@ able and this did it .
if you do not , he spread out everywhere .
it would have been a quite bad situation .
it changes a little bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could start what the inter@@ ruption was held to a minimum , if that under such circumstances is the right term at all .
I needed money , so I had to go better .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at one time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
the rowing of itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even greater .
in the in@@ viol@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ b@@ ending morning something more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Ar@@ til@@ l@@ ery Reg@@ iment in an deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it just repeatedly , how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore , a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I could not have a better person for the train@@ ee or wish a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm that could not compete with their opponents .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams ran out from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were very much tr@@ apped .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let it pl@@ uck .
we had a good start and at the same time , we were not prepared to make some tolerance .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take for one year before it will make decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver will have to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this could have done so much pressure .
in London it took about six months to compreh@@ end that I am a Olympi@@ an .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years of pre @-@ exempl@@ ary for clarity made
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose group , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , geht in den retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far . &quot;
a small fr@@ än@@ k@@ ischer drinking water @-@ purpose as a model for the big water producers .
so some time ago it was in the original in a part of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
few later the water forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken re@@ ached the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was far seen as exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler who was 31 years old in the kenn@@ el staff , about 28 years as managing director .
now he was reti@@ red at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group with its headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , Munici@@ p@@ ality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 15@@ 0000 cu@@ bic metres of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 residents .
member communities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
for further towns and communities there are water suppliers .
the current chairman , Breit@@ bach mayor mayor , Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was shut down in 1985 and was appointed as managing director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verb@@ andes .
&quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extend from water management and maintenance activities , the budget@@ ary creation , calcul@@ ating fees and contributions up to emergency rates , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , they called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new well ( 1994 ) , property sales in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) , and compensation for farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the rev@@ amps of water lines .
there have been no st@@ agn@@ ation , and you have always received innovations since water life dra@@ ined and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised G@@ öl@@ ler , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used himself with a lot of heart bloody for his water purpose , and he has regul@@ ates the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago he said to be a real pract@@ itioner of the success of the V@@ eit@@ er Group on the nit@@ rate of nit@@ rates in front of the Water@@ forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken District .
he has received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler of his turn praised the water hum@@ p@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him 28 years with him .
he is the best water hum@@ p , and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his perspective he recorded the fountain , and the re @-@ structured of the kenn@@ el association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were however the tube @-@ down at the peak in Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on a 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night has been working , so that the towns could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn also has only maintained , because you filled the high @-@ container from P@@ ett@@ stadt .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was transferred to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who comes to the succ@@ ession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing of notes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we do not say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher@@ in in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick for Deutsche St@@ ah@@ lindustrie
the kr@@ isen@@ g@@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in milli@@ on@@ aires .
financial loads , which dro@@ pping out the industry from the eco @-@ flow , are from the table .
it remain in the liberation of the renewable energy transformation at the inventory in the so @-@ called equity production in the German steel industry , said Bundes@@ sm@@ in@@ Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche General Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ ag@@ aus@@ gabe ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we were able to finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was first planned to ask the steel producer , the gases from the ho@@ cho@@ p for generating power for their own consumption in order to ask for the order .
the steel industry was dro@@ pping up according to information from the German industry association . additional costs between 120 and 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now an agreement with EU Commission after talks with competition comm@@ iss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , the case with an E@@ EG &apos;s turnover of 20 percent .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on its independence .
thus the status quo of the previous settlement will be largely fixed .
particular importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on the reform of the emissions right , climate and employment targets are considering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a significant price pressure from the financial crisis 2008 .
last year the situation was exac@@ erb@@ ated more than the world &apos;s biggest producer in China given the weak@@ ened domestic demand factor in steel on the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel dis@@ ing price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
at the one hand , imports of import duties on import of import , on the other hand the economic views in China have stopped .
unclear is how sustainable the pricing is effective .
the German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained carefully in the Thursday .
finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nat@@ ing .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with other cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp finally wanted to conclude a locker of individual works .
in the German steel industry , there were around 86@@ 000 people at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ ti@@ ous despite increasing prices and growing orders .
at the same time , they produced more than 3.4 million tons of six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , as the economic union of steel is shared on Friday .
after a short increase in May the total quantity went back to the second month .
since the beginning of the year the production involves two percent below the previous year .
the association expects an improved contract with an increasing contract in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing lessons sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school@@ choir , in the teacher @-@ studies she sl@@ ated the lyrics of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a sen@@ iors @-@ choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sing me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; describes them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a sample they feel balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
by doing so , they do something good in their health and spirit .
because singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior Bundes@@ liga .
most sen@@ iors sang in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the enjoyment of music , describes h@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular co @-@ operation , sen@@ iors may have soci@@ alised and maintain social contacts .
because frequently they solve social and family structures in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speak and organize themselves to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
because in doing so , sen@@ iors are taking a deep and controlled breathing .
who@@ ever challenges his lungs in everyday life as quickly as the pu@@ ste .
even if it is about obtaining the sound of voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elderly often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sen@@ iors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the sen@@ iors of sen@@ iors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in the school and in leisure , explaining them .
L@@ enz observed frequently , that the singing or hearing of songs in older people awak@@ ened many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and particularly tun@@ es , he denied themselves den@@ ying themselves in the long term events .
at singing the head is also request@@ ing a special performance , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time , concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a big cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , exercise so , not only concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the acknowled@@ gment that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I am too long for something , I will be better and watch@@ ful over me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he does to have little talent , be@@ ating L@@ enz .
you do not sing alone - at 50 sin@@ t people who sounds there when sometimes a sound goes off ?
looking for the suitable offer have sen@@ iors various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , you can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ ical choir can turn directly to the church or the church .
many elderly @-@ ench@@ ors can also be found via the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbours around the internet .
who desire has to sing , should join forces in a choir , bad@@ ges h@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul well and has some liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
Cats are sensitive as male &apos;s at the hor@@ ror of the kittens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover , which effect the ru@@ fen by cat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
to her surprise , the Mi@@ dian also left the males not cold - however they kept in contrast to the females always the same .
feminine cats can recognize the sing@@ ular degree of cat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys in the h@@ ight of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to lau@@ ts of kittens that have chosen in great distress as scientists from the veter@@ inary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
they also react to the herds of kittens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the h@@ ew@@ ing of less and strongly regul@@ ates for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by der MH@@ H .
it is first authorized in the study that was published on this Friday in the magazin &quot; BMC Evol@@ u@@ tionary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already figured out that the duration and sound of the K@@ b @-@ Schre@@ ie with the ur@@ gency of their assistance is distinguished .
a total of nine grown boys and eight females were observed from the animal conservation of the MH@@ H .
they were pre @-@ played for a rod of little ones who were taken out of the worm for three minutes and separated from both mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger bi@@ b which were additionally raised high .
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample of sample for expres@@ sive .
&quot; all females , even those who have not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted in differenti@@ ated at the hor@@ rors , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned up faster to the loud@@ speaker , if this Ru@@ fe of the very rainy K@@ b played .
this ability may be alle@@ ged or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already investig@@ ates the reactions of women and men to bab@@ y@@ ans .
also , some studies show that women more sensitive to inf@@ ants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ o Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Pod@@ ol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; in Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the one @-@ term soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r has been er@@ ected as a ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
he will be thrown , member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after Putin &apos;s trial , Turkey is taking place once again an important soccer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Du@@ ell of the Arch@@ riv@@ als between settlements Istanbul and Luke Pod@@ ol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Business as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even during the suspension of the exclusion after the overthrow of trial in July , the government , the daily life of norm@@ ali@@ es should not be affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
there is also never halt before the football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r , the Prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s office placed an ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
this is now thrown by the country living in America with a terrorist group , member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ r should be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who made the President of the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup attempt .
although it is valid for 90 days at first , it is still open until October , in fact it has on the lives of the most towers , but almost no effects .
the night &apos;s &quot; democracy &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for finished .
the sport is - as the whole land - split into han@@ ger and opponent &apos;s gans .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs &quot; are traditionally not counted among the friends of the President .
what the Gro@@ s of the Tur@@ ks but in view of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coup .
and even the fans agree , whether their heart is going for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sett@@ kt@@ as .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be especially arriving at Lukas Pod@@ ol@@ ski .
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the expired season among evidence : with 17 gates and nine templates in all cont@@ ests ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first season as the Top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game of Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he sco@@ red the 1 : 0 @-@ Vic@@ tre@@ ffer .
the newspaper &quot; FAN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; took him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the Pok@@ al .
thanks &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; found the dis@@ appointing season to record a conc@@ ert@@ master conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the round @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; li@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is also in the European League early . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the south per Li@@ g there was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have managed and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pod@@ ol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master visits the game was better .
above all thanks to Mario G@@ ome@@ z , who signed up with 26 seasons as an Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sch@@ ütz@@ nig , the basis for the 14th title .
that is also the reason that the fans continue to return to the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the AC Florence took under contract under contract and was not only partially posted to pe@@ dic@@ ed G@@ ome@@ z after Putin &apos;s trial , because of the political situation in the country after its EM holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Mario wants to come to us he must only say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it pres@@ cri@@ ed the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kick@@ er &quot; Club@@ boss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ boss F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there would have to be prepared , but willing to re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish around a third of its total to 7.5 million Euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he clearly stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary to Florence we cannot pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals for Olympics in Rio
the 34 year old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin has been blocked twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia step@@ pe may not launch in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics &apos;s sin@@ ner can only lau@@ gh it - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping determines still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian swi@@ mm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who turned aside for a d@@ oping down to her starting right shortly before playing the playing field ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess and un@@ paid .
it offered a wh@@ im@@ si@@ cal scenarios : with a smile sm@@ iles , she was still proud to be in the hall and had prov@@ oked it with her performance .
as proof that she will not get gold , the audience broke out into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ stur@@ m .
but there are many more sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start despite d@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the controversi@@ al figures in the athle@@ tics Men .
he was all@@ locked for two times ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his b@@ ann , the Olympic champion from 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champions is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered as the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ aica ) : the two @-@ old Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress and si@@ eben@@ ary world championship had to sit in 2010 a six @-@ month cur@@ re after having been taking the pain of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
it had had a severe dental pain after an operation , the 29 @-@ year old .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympics of 2012 and Europ@@ am@@ eister@@ schaft from 2010 to 2016 tested positive on the banned stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the det@@ ox in@@ gest@@ ion and was locked up six months .
the four most common lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold favor@@ it@@ in .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ tre@@ k ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was locked in 2010 positively and 21 months closed .
a means of penis enlargement be responsible , eu@@ ted Mer@@ tre@@ k .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes , so many medals were subsequently det@@ ri@@ mental .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on has lost its world championship title of 2005 nine years later , after having been determined by it testosterone d@@ oping .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to make Olympics silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid arthritis and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone mis@@ use .
the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 was reported due to an Ur@@ gent International Criminal Tribunal for the International Criminal Code .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is standing on position two of the puppy list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world @-@ sli@@ der and Gold@@ fam@@ it@@ in has only been tested in May , but may still launch in Rio .
during the 29 years old world championship , references to the intake of a ver@@ bot@@ y nutritional supplements have been found , the spar@@ row of the world @-@ Anti @-@ d@@ oping agency W@@ ada went out and ran already on 13 July .
Bom@@ ben@@ ign in Thailand - Ost@@ rei@@ cher@@ in inju@@ red - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is standing with the wife in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ell , Fri@@ day@@ early .
you have suffered cutting off , and was treated in the hospital , but this has already been abandoned .
your home trip has been planned for the beginning of September .
whether on other explo@@ sions on the holi@@ day@@ island of Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he , are also Austrian citizens , be still unclear .
the State Department I stand in constant contact with the local authorities , so m@@ öll .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok the Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a shel@@ tered two bom@@ bs .
according to police , a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in were killed and about 20 people have been wo@@ unded , including the Austrian , three Dutch , three defe@@ ats and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning again two jumps ended up , so loud the authorities were killed another human .
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ b of bom@@ b .
the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong was viol@@ ated by police information a taxi driver .
at Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bom@@ b explo@@ ded an urban nucle@@ us .
the spr@@ int be according to the authorities in a flo@@ wer@@ pot in front of the prec@@ in@@ ct pol@@ y police in the air .
finally det@@ on@@ ations still demanded for det@@ on@@ ations in ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he , on the southeast coast several Ver@@ sions .
one goes out of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b attack carry the same manus@@ cript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Min@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Crit@@ eria stabili@@ z@@ ee early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible mot@@ if@@ s - most likely , however , it is a matter of the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in attacks which is typical for the bom@@ b attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police declared , however , the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebel@@ li@@ ence , or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather clear that the bom@@ bs were laid by the opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta .
the authorities would have kept secret cl@@ ues to imp@@ ending references in the south of the country - but they do not have been informed about the exact time and places .
yet again , the group behind the attacks .
the police reported its officials in the entire country to secure security around important governance buildings and airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement parks .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b attacks , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the wor@@ e @-@ selling Bom@@ ben@@ ign , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at his home page , to provide the instructions of the Thai safety authorities in a consequence .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) yellow for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ard and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between security and Muslim populations , the most necessary travel will not occur in these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
higher security risk ( security level 2 ) yellow for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday spent a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on one of the military j@@ unta extended Constitution .
this spatial military influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bom@@ bs were an attempt to sti@@ pul@@ ate chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which received bloody un@@ rest in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , holds itself to good , the kingdom again led to stability and order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a handle for years in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the conflict more than 6@@ 500 people were killed .
a year ago , in Bangkok , a bom@@ bed were killed at a popular Hind@@ u @-@ circuit in 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack on the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the spot@@ light of the Federal Council for Constitu@@ tional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several indigenous people , the Constitu@@ tional Ob@@ si@@ zer also have put the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are witn@@ essing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key points for aspirations against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitu@@ tional Council Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the for@@ rest of the Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in a extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore , we are monitoring the movement well .
the &quot; identical movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it is directed against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by reason@@ ing . &quot;
Ver@@ sat@@ sch@@ üt@@ zer in nine Bundes@@ länder - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , Saxony and Thür@@ ingen - observe the &quot; ident@@ it@@ arian &quot; already .
Ma@@ xi@@ ate said , his authority has voted closely with the govern@@ ors .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identical movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitu@@ tional Council .
generally try extrem@@ ists to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extrem@@ ists .
this is not a concrete advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda should do the people emoti@@ onally .
young people are given in a special way .
this is dangerous .
finally , it was reported from several federal states reports on contacts of &quot; ident@@ it@@ arian &quot; to Af@@ rod@@ ites .
ma@@ sts did so , he did not have a knowledge .
for the constitutional protection possible contacts of this species can only be relevant only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , alters its target area and is so extrem@@ ist .
hence , it is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the marked increase of legal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and Refu@@ gee , Ma@@ din@@ ed , he would not yet speak of new rights in this context .
but we have stated in recent years that it can give illegal structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ day@@ group .
it may well be that further legal entities or small groups form to form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee centres or attacks from other far @-@ sex@@ ist mot@@ if@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not recogni@@ zable from Germany &apos;s wide range or pan @-@ wide control of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sp@@ ice cr@@ ack@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the groups currently have emerged at the regional level or in social networks .
concerned Ma@@ un@@ ning that there were many gri@@ ps on the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the Tat@@ verd@@ ant attacks on Asyl@@ um for asylum seek@@ ers were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated criminal off@@ ences or p@@ endant of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed sanctions which previously had nothing to deal with right @-@ wing extrem@@ ists who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or left but then radic@@ alised by far @-@ right voc@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te will be an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it

this shows the bra@@ ve appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center spon@@ ge of easily sur@@ vey@@ ed swi@@ mm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return of 48 seconds its outlet , and captured the 59@@ th place of 59 starter .
but it was rather his not just sport@@ y figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old are still participating at the Olympic Games ?

if an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors and passengers are wo@@ unded on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ circle Au@@ rich ) eight people .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe inju@@ ries , shared the police with .
the 66 years old driving of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to differ according to their information according to a counter@@ parts , which was partly driving on the cross @-@ road .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a speech in the police Au@@ rich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the location of the bus , the people could not rely on the bus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ brig@@ ade free the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ance and a not@@ ions came to the exp@@ ir@@ ation on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ last travellers were brought back by a regular bus to the Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there you should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the debit and possible witnesses to log in to the police .
the fees are per cu@@ bic metres Ab@@ wasser . from October 1st , 2016 for the area of Ab@@ wasser@@ io Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( until now 26 euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( until 19.@@ 90 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the resort in Az@@ endorf the Ab@@ wasser@@ Fee will be even later if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a superf@@ lu@@ ous calculation , the Ab@@ wasser@@ preis in Az@@ endorf will be present at 4.@@ 37 Euro per Ku@@ bik@@ meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported to the approval of the budget by the Council of the Kul@@ mb@@ ach , found that for these se@@ wage systems over@@ covers .
the Kas@@ endorf market is oblig@@ ated to legally oblig@@ ate the grounds of making the facilities available .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from the Wel@@ sch@@ ger@@ ade , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ p , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , have to take more deeply into the w@@ allet .
the bi@@ ble increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed the Panel , was necessary to be a novel@@ ist of the fees for the deriv@@ ative systems of the market .
the period from October 2016 to September 2020 may be over@@ - or sub@@ covers from the prec@@ eding period of the period .
the engra@@ ving ag@@ it@@ ching increased by Schmidt so that it is handy with all three se@@ wage systems to produce relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage waste , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
this way , due to the small distribution system , for example , expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a effect .
the se@@ wage is readily available in all three plants .
further be in the initial calcul@@ ator period in all three installations not least due to their age of gentle and repair expenses in a considerable scale .
the complex in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sch@@ ger@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the Ab@@ wasser@@ u Az@@ endorf the mechanical Bel@@ ü@@ ter anlage had to be exchanged due to any damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ ch Gre@@ ater had to be over@@ hau@@ led for nearly 20 years old F@@ Ö@@ R@@ DER@@ AN@@ LA@@ GEN from scratch , and at the pond si@@ p , had to be built up after almost 20 years of operation the first Kl@@ är@@ t@@ eich , the cle@@ ver@@ ge and an extra ins@@ cri@@ b to be installed in future , in order to be able to keep the water@@ tight specifications in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the advanced tut@@ or and maintenance costs have been taken into account according to the new calcul@@ ating period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to power costs , which at the previous lim@@ estone in 2011 / 2012 was still clearly below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that in the small waste water fall into the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully beat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either Schmidt , the launch of large sub @-@ level costs for waste water in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to stay pre@@ cip@@ ti@@ ous in the duration of stone buildings , especially since you cannot extend the supply of water @-@ purpose Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ei@@ al to these facilities , because it is a matter of deficit .
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .

the annual average recovery of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
rates of inflation since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 -@@ 0,2 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; -@@ Eff@@ ici@@ zed as Asian @-@ car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired to be inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is impro@@ per to races .
with its fil@@ tering tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily foods to change the reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already adjacent to the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are un@@ flo@@ wer@@ ed , pecu@@ liar tools , which produce more than 30 million improved rar@@ ity per day .
all laws are getting to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have pulled up in the past critic@@ ised cr@@ iti@@ zed in which they have been accused that the app black@@ face is convey@@ ed or white skin as a beauti@@ cian of propag@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week a filter proposed a filter that struck them lo@@ pe , wrong teeth and raised w@@ angen , there were some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gel@@ änder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repet@@ itive cont@@ ingent on a larger problem is indicated that the company has with diversity .
the news and the indi@@ gn@@ ation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and mother@@ board , a day after snap@@ chat that this feature de@@ activ@@ ates the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was meant as tri@@ bute to An@@ ime characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced the r@@ attle bul@@ us , rec@@ alled the filter at viol@@ on@@ c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the An@@ ime comparison table .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely used over the photos that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and was said uncomfortable &quot; . &quot;
it imp@@ lied that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ point of a very di@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the fil@@ tering effects .
it shows that the filter is not bo@@ iled , but that the nest @-@ face has been de@@ duc@@ ted into the de@@ valu@@ ated extrem@@ m .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ h@@ te .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diet and integration fight , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the race of race than their older counter@@ players - could be expected to expect sensiti@@ v@@ ities .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt an image created that for a user is insul@@ ating , &quot; so it &apos;s much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , Z@@ hu , who works as Produc@@ t@@ writer and Ingenieur@@ in for Medium , her Snap@@ chat account , urged others to do the same .
in an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that gl@@ aci@@ ers @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y reflect a lack of diversity among the imports of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu crit@@ ici@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and ended up their essay with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese I @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , which made Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered .
the Company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it was made Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a microphone , the company recently focused on a personnel responsible who focused on under@@ signed population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she is closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military management ver@@ se@@ ated ISIS sec@@ ration information , presents the Committee of Congress
military belonging to the United States Central Command has modified information to record an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual states had allowed on site to report a investig@@ ator committee in a report on Thursday .
the pro@@ visional report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the dispute Committee , Intelligence Committee and the German Government Comm@@ une , reported by major dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command secret anal@@ ysts , reported as superi@@ ors showing their ass@@ essm@@ ents to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , that controls the American military @-@ per@@ mut@@ ations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news service provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ de@@ uren typically were reported a more positive image of the American efforts towards terrorism as it could have allowed the actual states on site and were more positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the leaders in Cent@@ Com are up to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report gives detailed proof @-@ to @-@ date problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi armed forces .
although there is no direct references to change that governance under Obama has given to change the reports , it shows how analy@@ zing themselves exposed to pressure from their prec@@ eding , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements in front of the Congress are significantly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com associated publicly known that military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can begin already in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress and Congress , from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion .
from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command have changed the after@@ math of the Central Command to send the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ can initi@@ ate the Task Force in Life after they played that analy@@ st are worried about the mani@@ pulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the message service published on Thursday released their own findings , which agreed with some of the conclusions of Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ sto@@ cked process for the dra@@ fting of im@@ pris@@ oned evalu@@ ations to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest level democr@@ at , as a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; del@@ ayed the publication of thought@@ ful reports , &quot; ash@@ amed the mor@@ ality among anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave excessive space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and democr@@ ats gave no evidence to have an input of the White House at Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts in terms of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by the general manager of the Pentagon , which were included in complaints from Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , given in an opinion that the Defense Secretary would have no reports of the Congress , during the investigations of the general public @-@ term still rag@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ gi@@ ating opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the communication services and defense minister will welcome a controversi@@ al debate on these important topics of national defense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inquiries made on the question of a successful a@@ ign campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence . )
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ essm@@ ents of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis @-@ regions .
the cr@@ iti@@ ques with regard to the secret government remin@@ isc@@ ences of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , writing about by George W. Bush on the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts , only a small cre@@ w@@ ning w@@ b in Iraq , and little time embarrass@@ ed to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker decided to specify Mr. Hoo@@ ker after st@@ ating government officials who would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since this pro@@ visional re@@ efs would have been commissioned in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge has not been published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commands , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was crit@@ ici@@ zed by members of leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure due to its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was reti@@ red in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US winning vi@@ ved match in the field @-@ ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner about Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women at a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually be a memorable output , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said it could not remember the ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not belonging to the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , this knows it : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons lying on the first place , which remains un@@ struck after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
the United States and the United States will succ@@ e@@ eding on Saturday last night of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two within their group will gain from six teams of the first and second place .
the initial plat@@ eau is going to last somewhat longer out of the way that the other group lead .
as always the game may go on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex because of their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( their two older sisters gave sports at the Dre@@ xel Universität ) , with 16 years she became a member of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because it could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then the year 2012 , in which for her and her team all seemed near@@ er .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , the coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; a culture @-@ change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work officer in London we now have .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the ruin .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the tor@@ ch in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand from the Nah@@ um area .
India was gone in the tournament without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until they took the game into their hands .
she finished a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left side , then moved into the middle and turned the ball into the gate around the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last four @-@ district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly changing and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid run between competition and quest .
it is , as if the ol@@ ymp@@ ic f@@ ack@@ el itself is a burning st@@ ab , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ rust@@ ling to swi@@ mm@@ ers to the swi@@ mm@@ ers to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ eten .
you can &apos;t switch the TV to read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour on the qu@@ eue in the coff@@ es@@ hop , without a Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman s@@ warm with gr@@ ass@@ chen , could have been produced under these well known names that would be sent to Prime Time , rebuilt through sponsors and well @-@ sensitive TV commerci@@ als when he would be a swi@@ mm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even f@@ encer .

further from the centre , in part in the shadow are the sports , which are not generally accepted : air@@ brush , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I might recognize those arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me direct the attention to the discreet char@@ ms of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline has already been an ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 it had been a ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 , it was the last 16 years so spar@@ se that many people asked , did not know that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA has sent Ath@@ l@@ ete to competition , it has never won a med@@ al in tramp@@ oline and until 2012 has had a athletes , who made it up to the end of the end .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who share the women .
Dong Dong out China and Ro@@ sia Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold med@@ al from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline jump has a certain out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds fitting for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ears of a cl@@ owns school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an advent@@ uro@@ us enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the kar@@ mic tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never wanted to end up - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports , which it &apos;s essentially united .
the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; is known by the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as the spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging winner jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ aving and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are judged for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local Olympi@@ apro@@ g after execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ long athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are compete in Rio .
the common ol@@ ymp@@ ic vector is almost straight .
med@@ al hop@@ eful must continue in their quest for gold further , faster , up and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes round and back , up and down on the playground .
they chase not only the bri@@ dle or the output wall , but in the TV transfer also another cav@@ ity destination : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the targeted pursuit is no@@ ble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even touch a spect@@ ator at tears .
but it is also what I think even with the look of these games as something fati@@ gu@@ ed .
the tramp@@ oline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the tramp@@ oline @-@ jum@@ per is above .
a up@@ ward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ ude off , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes down , then down , then ef@@ fort@@ lessly back up .
also here , there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , not v@@ ault in distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only .
the qualification and endor@@ sement of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the Stream@@ ing around 13.00 Eastern Time ; which the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will shine as part of an afternoon track on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of Olympia man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one which is likely to over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the awareness increase can only be achieved through the Att@@ ach@@ ers and objecti@@ fication of male athletes - like the male US Tur@@ ner noisy The Wall Street Journal recently rec@@ essed , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its following air rin@@ se , new fan@@ atic community .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ed &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a Al@@ allies of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that zig demonstr@@ ators were killed while the cl@@ ashes with the police were killed with ar@@ che@@ ers .
is Ethiopia straight to inter@@ rupt ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the more stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of strengthening of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months the protests against the government conqu@@ ered the country and went into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people cr@@ amped on the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses called that polic@@ emen were shot on zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
changing shifting videos about protests , pres@@ um@@ ably by the last or beginning of this year , show like security @-@ people young people hit with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now demanding an in@@ coming investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services collaborate closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , get as much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian business expan@@ sion@@ able in the considerable rapid@@ ity .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new p@@ endant in the capital Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the supp@@ ression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , which govern@@ ors were effectively transferred to silence .
many have been sent to exile or prison , or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire young protest@@ ed .
a generation Protest@@ ant .
there are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground @-@ use up to the stran@@ gl@@ ehold imposed in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a extended election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tension along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a battle for this z@@ ack@@ y , controversi@@ al line called for in June hundreds of life .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were en@@ forced in recent years more or less forced to protect Tur@@ bul@@ enzen and rebuild itself again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of b@@ ann@@ ess under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate through social media , since cheaper smartphones were becoming more frequently used and the internet services improved .
even if the government lock the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are doing at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies , conce@@ al where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians showed that they gathered so at protein .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ons of prosper@@ ous the am@@ har@@ as , the predomin@@ antly Christian high@@ lands meet , in politics and economy , while they are the Oro@@ mos of whom many Muslims are living and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos took place .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have felt that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who are about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former Reb@@ els leader , was until his death at a non @-@ coun@@ cils of illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was seen as a tacti@@ cal genius , a man to think about the corners .
anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special officer to deal with opponents and make them un@@ det@@ ri@@ mental .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ op@@ aque reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
other than Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
anal@@ ysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services rendered by the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia was experienced such a mo@@ il in 2005 after thousands against elections were protest@@ ed by the government and were subsequently stolen by the government .
during the following swe@@ eps were killed many protest@@ ers , even though it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest was passed relatively quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; development experts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infra@@ structural Planning , like the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ zug &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but obviously , this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , Protest@@ ant in gon@@ dar , a sham@@ anic city , of Tig@@ ray performed shops and the hat@@ red against the Tig@@ ray is becoming increasingly active in social media .
anal@@ ysts are saying that the protests of the US and other Western allies in a pecu@@ liar position bring .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for ur@@ onic flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if they were reported recently that it has closed this base .
while the West doesn &apos;t want to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his allies to merge in an already vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump is explaining his claim Obama was founded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to disp@@ el the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y caused by the campaign that his multiple repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State of Islamic State .
this clar@@ i@@ xed new questions about the communication skills of the President of the Republi@@ can party whether it is able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public .
it also leads his fellow cl@@ ays , who are trying to take him into shelter during a event@@ ful phase , to explain to the actual position , declar@@ ations that he could not have meant .
having made the announcement in an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump returned to the statement on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply s@@ ark@@ ic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a row of interviews , he meant the alleg@@ ation perfectly seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help to dimin@@ ish the statement by remember@@ ing it that Mr. Obama wants to anni@@ hil@@ ate him , the Republi@@ can President wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t to Mr. Tr@@ ump her@@ ab , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign for falling surveys on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ kas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew a strong criticism of himself when he said , the Russians were asked Mrs. Clin@@ ton emails , but he later said &quot; Nat@@ ar@@ ky I said the sar@@ cast@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic borders in politics , and then return to ruin .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how to get certain messages from his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; depending on the way the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth West , a communication @-@ sex@@ ist that ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to hold its statements about it , so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has an even estimated sound , since its surveys have further declined .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was released on Friday showed a lead with a great advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative expres@@ sions , he accused his critics often to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand their hum@@ our .
but while he is strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has led his lo@@ y@@ al mit@@ igation into the un@@ comfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may also like his statements .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , had great effort to defend candidates today in CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements was asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it but@@ b@@ ish , totally wrong and therefore it happened because he t@@ arri@@ ed the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstre@@ am rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans attempt to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as the Secretary of State , ISIS allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East to aggressive under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and bow@@ ed them to tre@@ ad upon each of his words , and to be pres@@ et against him .
he married the &quot; poor , j@@ ämmer@@ ling &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You Can &apos;t it ! &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats sp@@ ot@@ ted on Mr. Tr@@ umps exc@@ use as only one further proof that he is in@@ appropriate for the President &apos;s Office .
once more than the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point come back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ ash@@ y café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , that no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years in good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front was pushed back .
the business so@@ ap ch@@ erie , which replaced the b in summer 2014 , s@@ ells so@@ ap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes .
locals acc@@ entu@@ ate it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ye wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still don &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB was dead , the Chelsea Hotel and now is a so@@ ap store . &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also new .
a rebuilt Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cis@@ co Rod@@ rigu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employees of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he began working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer provided a customer to provide money for a new accounts , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rod@@ rigu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els , the same es@@ pres@@ a model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said that he would also experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wi@@ ches stand with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are wardro@@ bes , like cap@@ ers and swal@@ low oni@@ ons .
there is natural medication .
the café serves no beer more , for this there are fresh juice .
after nine months Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said that he noticed a st@@ alled stream in old tri@@ bal customers .
&quot; many old customers were also forced by chance from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday was Rebecca Oliveira one such customer .
Oliveira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and regularly visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after they came to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after having closed the b , she gave a while the coff@@ e@@ plate on , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the fo@@ b which liked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drank tea , even if she placed on this day instead of her usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and inev@@ it@@ ably always the same thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss spending and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and make new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal getting still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said that he has no Gro@@ ll about it , that the so@@ ap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie rose to produce a special so@@ ap for b with the cold @-@ bre@@ ed coffee of the coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go into their offer yet , &quot; said Rod@@ rigu@@ ez .
and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu to the Polish and Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said that he has prepared to put them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ d coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers there is a new ver@@ b to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ bal medicine and said that he was destroyed on the ground as the café included .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ ey said that the beg@@ s of the location and the beast felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to cra@@ w@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as gour@@ mets had president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt a Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen the Fif@@ th Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ tortie soup .
his menu on this day was a little hum@@ ble : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , Kartoff@@ el@@ p@@ ü@@ ree and dessert a p@@ aving p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
married couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and they both are food historic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treated by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while being told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about living in a residential home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per publishing house , illustrated the history of American cuisine while the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ por@@ ters in the Ic@@ eberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop to the dinner , a small , sn@@ ak@@ os@@ at I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock exchange in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh @-@ sand@@ wich with olive oil , while co@@ e , 57 , tru@@ th@@ ahn , with mas@@ hed and vegetable @-@ eating .
as the Rep@@ orter Hack@@ br@@ aten , this was the couple for discussion of the food in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ brot , Leb@@ er@@ kä@@ se and Boh@@ nen@@ brot .
they were made out of an ingredient and some cheap , which stretched the ingredient .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ ins .
&quot; it has to be put in the stomach such as lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cooked for male Feld@@ sp@@ ans and it became fresh b@@ aked past@@ ry for breakfast , lunch and dinner served .
there were the Americans who sent food to a hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; A Square Church &quot; is the paths that surround the country with it not to be the lar@@ v@@ ous land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talked about why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as stra@@ ined was the new budget so@@ ws : mysterious dishes such as lo@@ aves and Kas@@ ser@@ ol@@ len have become a stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ olle became more than &quot; wonderful species , eating remains prec@@ eding , &quot; mer@@ ked Zi@@ egel@@ man , since ch@@ efs are able to hide uncomfortable ingredients under a creative sau@@ ce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheap dry @-@ dry .
meat , which was the centre of the American cuisine for years , became a rarely used luxury .
pecu@@ liar mixing have been tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutr@@ itious fl@@ at@@ ement priority has priority to taste or even healthy kitchen .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , prepare a dish from this epoch , b@@ aked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no com@@ for@@ ter addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann leads further out : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pe@@ an@@ ut butter and b@@ aked oni@@ ons fit not to each other .
it was typical for many of the utility recipes .
as never before or since then , household turnover - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 , the eating habits of the country is such .
using recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , encouraged them to become a household &apos; household &apos; and the challenge to transform t@@ amp like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square &quot; is a celebration of the great treat .
in particular , the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ u @-@ u @-@ u .
while he is publicly called the simple I@@ owa Farm@@ houses in his kitchen , he sp@@ ri@@ vet it like the milli@@ on@@ th male of the world where he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ en@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost w@@ ild@@ ed dining room and carried a tu@@ king .
he was delightful un@@ realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt may have committed the same mistake when not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have promp@@ ted him to stat@@ ute with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ ke@@ eper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt to empha@@ size that the White House brought the bo@@ red food in Washington but also one of the most precious eating . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression , deal with food was rejected once the country came back to its feet again .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave him better understood when writing the book , the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the wast@@ age of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ exploited .
after the T@@ eller were assigned to Eis@@ enberg , they pulled them and co@@ e a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt was eating at home .
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and imp@@ lied that it was an ordinary trick , hum@@ ble recipes to miss a name .
there was no s@@ lag@@ ged cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ innamon .
each di@@ pped slightly re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on into the teeth , brown gi@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e hol@@ te three times a stroke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A couple of hat@@ s would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo .
he continued his own life to help others : K@@ hal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : K@@ hal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people in Syria .
he is ris@@ ky all to save the lives of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a fa@@ ç@@ ade attack by the Assad regime .
Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which has saved lives according to image @-@ newspapers up to almost 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers putting their own life to move people out of the bom@@ b houses and to carry out first aid in the military area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil war that shows him in a 11 @-@ hour saving of a home from the ruins of a home in 2014 around the world .
it made the Syrian to illumin@@ ate symbolic figures in the Gre@@ ys of War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he has never seen himself , said according to image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , save lives , I think God in me sees a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Om@@ ar himself filed an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria .

Grön@@ land : the oldest wh@@ ist is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come to surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed after a study on board the histor@@ ic@@ ship S@@ anna back into the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie have only dealt with 150 years of offspring .
mostly swi@@ ms of the Green@@ land@@ hai along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it appears on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it arrives , speeds up the five meter long animal on sat@@ te 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a ro@@ be .
this of lon@@ eliness was shaped , but seems to be a bul@@ let for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of a Grön@@ land , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein , from Max @-@ Plan@@ ck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life @-@ span that means a world records .
though the evolution of evolution has long been that Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are st@@ ony .
only faul@@ ts the evidence .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are hard to observe , last@@ ly , they live especially in the ice sea , in front of the thin @-@ populated coastal regions of Canada , Green@@ land , Norway and Sp@@ its@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface mostly in winter .
about the li@@ fest@@ yles of Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie researchers know according to little .
your time @-@ pent@@ ag@@ hen they , when they set up six animals with one radio station in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
lo@@ ot make this ha@@ ie nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a ro@@ be , another one had sho@@ cked the j@@ aw of a young ic@@ ar@@ ist .
possibly j@@ ages them sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rou@@ illi@@ ers at the bottom of the ice me@@ ager and look car@@ c@@ asses who tor@@ rent out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now studied 28 Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Green@@ land or S@@ val@@ bard as a conf@@ ec@@ ing out of the depth of North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ meters long , while the largest 5@@ 02 centi@@ meters measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analysed them with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method of the nucle@@ us of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eyel@@ id emerg@@ es before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which included in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a striking a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
therefore , after the early 19@@ 50s , your birth should therefore be bigger amounts of that radi@@ o@@ active carbon @-@ based plant in the atmosphere .
in that with 220 centi@@ metres in the smallest animal , the lens @-@ core of the Lin@@ ear , on the other hand , a little surplus @-@ shot at carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it might have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in the year 2012 .
all major Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , that arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 2 @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed a 4@@ 93 cm long Green@@ land@@ hai at the age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with a 5@@ 02 centi@@ meters can be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Green@@ land@@ hai @-@ females get only then offspring when they are longer than four metres , was known .
it was possible to as@@ sign the researchers of the length of an age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters probably stood on the thres@@ hold of the sexually mature , and his age was intended for 156 years , the Grön@@ land with the multip@@ lication obviously was at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be the world @-@ directory for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live especially in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Green@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck , was a 120 year old har@@ p @-@ top , was caught before Alaska .
because of the low temperatures there is often the organism of the animals living there on as@@ parag@@ uses .
they thus mature - and al@@ tern hur@@ ry .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often becomes especially large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal heat is inserted .
the heat loss from a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is thus more dangerous and should concentrate as early as possible to have as many descendants as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein .
as a result , a very large animal should be investing more resources into a long life .
tom@@ yss in a double pack
with themes relating to B@@ auen , the council has focused on the latest meeting point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relief the board took the communication from Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the younger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dwell@@ ings can begin &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the real estate , par@@ z@@ elli@@ ation and preparation issues have been clar@@ ified and the applications for mess@@ ung could be put on the sale of land properties in the residential areas &quot; stre@@ l &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Aus@@ bau@@ ab@@ schnitt 1 ) of interested parties , nothing more in the way .
the council is convinced that the B@@ auf@@ ers are in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and equipment sen@@ iors alike .
as it meant , building author@@ is@@ ies can report immediately in the city hall about the award of the plots that is expected to advise the municipal level in its September meeting .
in order to also respond to requests for further commercial enterprises , associated with the creation of jobs , to be consul@@ ted , decided to change the Common Market Report only during the spring of this year .
thus in the area under@@ lar@@ lar@@ n there is already proven commercial area around two plots towards state @-@ road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the City on the Main Event continues in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg &apos;s best opportunities to attract and attrac@@ ting jobs and firms in London .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt is benef@@ ited most from the Bre@@ xit V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of Kompet@@ enz@@ fel@@ ds financial markets and imm@@ ov@@ able markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether funds will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has so far been approved for approval in Britain for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass .
that is just using big US banks .
several banks have already announced , jobs to shift .
the lob@@ by@@ vereinigung of Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects a maximum of five years with 10000 new jobs .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area united , as well as further important authorities such as the European Insurance O@@ PA and Risk Ass@@ or@@ ats ES@@ RB .
in Paris , it is head@@ quar@@ tered for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision of &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxemburg has indeed a large fund branch , tail@@ oring but as well as Dublin at the infrastructure worse .
it is easy to reach Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
furthermore , points the city with easy available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
on the Seine are also rent for first @-@ class business property by 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city offers seven , Luxembourg on square 19 , Dublin , and Paris at 37@@ th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even though quality of life is a matter of preference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in London , however , despite Bre@@ xit would remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic researchers .
in this case , the power relations also speak : in London according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba Ende 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives justice costs from the hep@@ atitis C Pat@@ ent@@ stre@@ it with Mer@@ ck
a US @-@ purpose inver@@ ters decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. claim to re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed the right costs , which you came from the hep@@ at@@ its C regulation with the Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was fre@@ ed by another sur@@ ron@@ age in the amount of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , following the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ medication S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a U.S. judge a pattern of mis@@ conduct on by Mer@@ cks , including the Mein@@ ries and other un@@ ethical actions .
when collecting the law@@ suit , on Thursday , US @-@ minist@@ ries of Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , that Gilead are entitled to access the cost , which arose during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to attract with Gilead , domin@@ ating the market of a new generation of hep@@ atitis C drugs , which can cure more than 90 percent of patients suffering from liver illness .
the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead and Mer@@ ck meet each other def@@ endant and possession of laboratories , those So@@ fos@@ bu@@ vir , who are active ingredients in the medications of Gilead .

the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb after the moving of the still left @-@ left group of fighters that buried within the city , currently the city .
they have received over 2,000 civilians who have been held by the fighters as host@@ ages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the D@@ KS Military Council Reu@@ ters .

Clin@@ ton employees earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % off .
in Friday , Hill@@ ary Clinton announced their tax return for 2015 , these revealed to the presidential election of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons of USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly at the Clinton Foundation , the former president Bill Clinton had generated an income of USD 3 million by the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her office in the State Department .
Clin@@ och@@ can@@ did@@ at for the Vice @-@ President , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax @-@ explan@@ atory in the last ten years .
you paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards with regard to financial transparency , &quot; was announced at Clin@@ ton Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion .
in a cr@@ acking contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false expres@@ sions and re@@ moves with regards to his previous promises to publish his tax @-@ declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential elections to publish their tax @-@ declar@@ ations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law because of this .
Tr@@ ump , a New Yorker busin@@ essm@@ an , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for its denial , a tax examination given by the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ton Elec@@ toral College in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential elections in democr@@ ats .
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advis@@ ors to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax testing are not complete .
m@@ umps cr@@ itic , among other things , the Republi@@ can president of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already been sil@@ ver@@ able that his ref@@ us@@ al issues related to assets , his gifts for charitable organisations , his busin@@ ess@@ men and various other connections have emerged , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the subject and released a video on Friday , published a video in the internet , in which high @-@ level Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans Rep@@ ump will call for his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject even during a speech about the economy of Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused to do what any other presidential candidate has done during the last decades and publish his tax @-@ explan@@ atory &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Polit@@ ico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid during the 1990s for two years , and has paid a few taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times z@@ iti@@ erte on Friday a number of tax ten@@ ants and tax advisory services , the information that might still be the case .
the federal system have become a topic in the elec@@ toral campaign .
Clinton receives a provision that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor war@@ n buff@@ et who would make sure people who earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton , last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate has his seat here , Tr@@ ump to exchange on their tax agreed .
Buff@@ ett said , he was also subjected to a tax examination of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump have &quot; fear &quot; before voting and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s campaign has returned tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ ton , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqua , New York , paid off on average an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of approx . 32 % between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40,@@ 5 % .
the tax declaration of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that only USD 100 their income are compared , unlike most of all Americans .

cond@@ oms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ sman@@ ship support Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ fant@@ ensch@@ utz
natural sh@@ aking in Tanzania use a un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants in from people inhabited settlements - they throw cond@@ oms to them that are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ffs .
the method has proved effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation who had already trained the idea ahead of years ago by keeping volunteers in villages in the North Tanz@@ ani@@ as , a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without destro@@ ying animals .
previously , many speakers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world telephone day dedicated to the animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit we could observe in these churches a change of their attitude , with them much more confidence that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without having the eleph@@ ants Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps cover the lighted of the eleph@@ ant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
when it is not deter@@ red , a so called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke . &quot;
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der ge@@ mix@@ es with earth is packed together with a fire@@ piece in a cond@@ om , whose end up to the ign@@ ition is shot .
when it is lit , the cond@@ om with a b@@ ang on and spr@@ inkl@@ ed fine dust at Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der in the air .
a hint is usually already made up to chase the eleph@@ ants .
a last possibility is a throwing @-@ fire that sho@@ ve a gol@@ dre@@ am@@ fire@@ work in the air and thereby creates a loud , bright explosion .

Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ selection was removed after &quot; arab@@ ic &quot; challenge - RT news
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media pro@@ clam@@ ation after going to betra@@ y the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ selection as it would have known Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger in Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his final stay Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of hotels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the country was not listed between countries which can be accessed directly from the hotel room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol has a way to choose Israel via a private call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the reception .
the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel indicated that the measure would be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ omin@@ ous decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that it stood , the director in the director looks even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the election is cle@@ ared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cited by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli amb@@ assador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov h@@ adas @-@ commerce , called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; says the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were de@@ fri@@ gh@@ tened of this event and fri@@ gh@@ tened .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this is based in Germany in this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident solved a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet in which people call the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the inn@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was referred to in a different post in which the hotel is located at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no@@ ble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; close to a Synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly proved all alleg@@ ations of itself and called the incident a &quot; re@@ viewing &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports the mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel does not include in the quick@@ list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung proclaimed a spokes@@ man of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

students p@@ ayed to Sao Paulo with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city , when they gathered themselves to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ h@@ as and rubber bul@@ lets against the protest@@ ers .
the difficulties arose , as police officers tried to ex@@ or@@ ite the students , which resulted in the police of rubber , com@@ rade and pot@@ assi@@ sts .
several hundred students participated in demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the proposals by the govern@@ or of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented in order to save money .
some of the Protest@@ ants saw Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its for the pro@@ visional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests raised some days after demonstr@@ ators in the masses on the streets to support the most sus@@ pen@@ ed president in Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which was inst@@ ig@@ ated by a v@@ ot@@ um of the Senate to its deriv@@ ation from the office .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran is suddenly rising to 71 % - RT business
according to the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian amb@@ assador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading of trade between Moscow and Teheran in the year comparison to 7@@ 0,9 percent .
since the international sanctions on Iran , the interest in the Russian company has increased greatly to businesses in the country , distributed the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he than@@ ked that the trade sum@@ s between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0,9 % compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent spr@@ ung@@ ed and ru@@ sting $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade fair was reached by deliveries of machines , comp@@ ass and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian foreign representatives presented around 35.@@ 000 VIS@@ AS , primarily of travel ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the tourist numbers in Russia .
one could say that the record pay ir@@ onic tourists in Russia of last year , &quot; said , &quot; said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that hopes the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors to change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , to have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

a rob@@ ber@@ drop is on Thursday evening on the drink market of RE@@ WE XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
among the board of a shr@@ ink @-@ monkey called for three dark @-@ d@@ ressed people who had disp@@ at@@ ched their faces , from the staff of the beverage brand the re@@ sign@@ ation of cash and escap@@ ed at first on foot and then probably with a silver colored VW @-@ golf .
how much money has been exploited , the police does not share .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator should have been between 1,60 and 1,70 metres , so relatively small .
the drink market is directly accessible from the Park@@ deck of the RE@@ WE market and is bad in sight .
the perpet@@ rators have to be sc@@ anned in direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from which opposite the par@@ ental @-@ car park with the sil@@ @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have been at the Tat@@ ry ( against 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) observations , which stand in connection with the rob@@ ber , should urgently draw in the police .

Ha@@ iger@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ m to the gate of mercy
the minist@@ ries from the past@@ oral unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ iger@@ loch St. Anna was on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were cop@@ ed .
in order to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ s@@ way of all the minist@@ ries in the next two years , the Ober@@ Minist@@ ran@@ ten@@ runde St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various Wall@@ ets objectives was checked and it was finally decided for the Bishop City of Freiburg , where this year was offered to the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the memorial p@@ forte of the Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage site .
16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bronn , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ iger@@ loch and Heiligen@@ feste rose to their way .

from Hor@@ b , it was driven by rail to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where there was also a Mu@@ en@@ ster of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage path was taken place by the Mu@@ en@@ ster .
the individual Tag@@ est@@ our@@ en arrived in the morning and in the evenings each with a short impulse with various prayers , songs and ty@@ pe@@ els .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the monastery team Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory , as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow , the An@@ ker@@ z@@ man took part , who had made his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the j@@ enny and made the legend of pride , having rus@@ hed to home a victory of the favor@@ ites .
England claims four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ med@@ a@@ medals .
they repe@@ ats the trick , after being in March at the railway @-@ world championship in London despite the plot , Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the operator Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a execution .
ho@@ ys reti@@ red a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton examined .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they remained , when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that un@@ fol@@ ds now .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - which won four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner sitting in the qualification round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the flo@@ cks of the New Zealand won in the first lap .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
exec@@ utions fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner was holding it .
a strategy change made a great deal of transformation to slow down in a higher gear to slow him and make it y@@ iel@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as the BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des on when this climb@@ ed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ ess@@ ation comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name for me .
in the En@@ dr@@ unde we have placed a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defeated the World Champions .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the tri@@ umph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des came to that he fell to the railway after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England .
this time has never been such a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels the whole GB flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have so badly affected with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect you to see successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ ro@@ me .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the area of the utmost that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three ol@@ ymp@@ ic gold medals in a contest .
that would happen to Kenn@@ y - who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently sacred date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a rash of six gold medals and a silver med@@ al .
the leu@@ ka@@ emia of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part in spr@@ int that today starts and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should become a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ al competition of the day but there were other good news for England .
Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometers race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 on the target .
the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord , which won in London Gold won at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
today the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of competition , where the Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had been argu@@ ed yesterday with officials before the qualification and called for him to measure his body size .
in the final women &apos;s contest , the morning continued and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Riv@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world @-@ time period in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB Team reli@@ es on his strong railway wheel team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a touch of medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London have crossed the expectations for Rio .
Dr@@ amas also played in the background , as the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical conduc@@ tors Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April surrounded by Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ cular and har@@ as@@ sment , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ ro@@ me , it looks quite as it could have reached the legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which at the perfect moment has reached its peak again .
future of mel@@ ting from Port@@ land due to the end of the end result of energy tr@@ ages
the future of the aluminium @-@ mel@@ t@@ down from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand at stake , as the plant operator can termin@@ ate the energy supplier and thereby raise all shipping agreements , as the supply of energy firms .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
one for 20 years of arrested sub@@ committee runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land , are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be at risk at closure .
moreover , it could come to domin@@ ating effects as the mel@@ ting accum@@ ulated about 10 percent of total electricity generation has been consumed .
2014 included Al@@ coa , the Point Henry mel@@ ting , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky one closing .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the power price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which can be the large aluminum mel@@ ted with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , distributed with that it assumes that three other owners announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture by Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will keep smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant continues to operate in Port@@ land , which means an additional physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to be said that the Tre@@ aties will be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have been in effect from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts will have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore the AG@@ L assumes that the contracts entered into the year 17 to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential implications for the revenues at AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the progn@@ oses of strong terminals for wholes@@ ale prices .
AG@@ L informed that the value of the contracts entered the amount of $ 187 million in the expectation of an cancellation .
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability of Alco@@ hol ... the mel@@ ting to operate or to ensure power supply to the mel@@ ting &quot; not com@@ promised .
the U.S. company said that it was completed in 2010 a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have been in effect from November this year , even if there is still a declaration which has been with@@ drawn from the treaty .
anal@@ ysts war@@ n due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the mel@@ ting mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land has approximately 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generating set , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an Re@@ ality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue
Kendall J@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Y@@ denomin@@ ator C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the S@@ cri@@ es of the US Vo@@ gue .
Kendall , the hall@@ amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and running on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this co@@ vers led to cr@@ ying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written Bandera . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bi@@ zar@@ res ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Y@@ un@@ cle ) as well as in the presence of the well @-@ known Show@@ biz un@@ cle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ re ) , as she ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic coat : you have planned all a surprise party .
that puts the kl@@ ee@@ ee@@ ze action virtually any birthday stand ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition , &quot; You were told that we would have forgotten ? &quot; , with the honest@@ y of a cartoon at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to be part of her other girls to participate in this publicity .
with regard to the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue , surely a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim likes she , what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned , be@@ aten ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West had to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the magazine is a League for itself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ ment is for Vo@@ gue the most widely sold issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles rather a photo band than a fashion magazine , the output takes a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the gro@@ oves of 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his cover is hop@@ eless@@ ly expected that during the last two years the magazine appeared even prior to the official announ@@ cements .
women who have already been on the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mod@@ elling &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the celebr@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Award @-@ winner and di@@ or@@ amb@@ assador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ denomin@@ ator - which is described from the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - among the earlier category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to the famous people or Re@@ ality Stars or te@@ ens from today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if all of it applies to common denomin@@ ator ) .
they are truly talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , that appeared on the last cover with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade was one of the most successful years of her career .
naturally J@@ enn@@ ers like success not to everyone .
with its Re@@ ality @-@ TV history J@@ enn@@ ers has always been ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Stephanie B@@ ym@@ our J@@ ator and their colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; the Mist@@ y of the Eye . &quot;
these feelings live up again when the message with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut , it seems to pass on the point .
Kendall J@@ ator is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
she is selling of her done pictures of Cindy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her leisure time she is at the Re@@ ality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community Centers centres year 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid fig@@ s of the country are re@@ directed annually by the local officials centres , while the sector is based on the impact of other mid @-@ recent transactions already over@@ loaded transactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Queensland , three of five people , mostly older people , migrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence did and those who do not have a means of un@@ solic@@ itation and appeal for free legal advice and legal advice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
legal services of the municipality , who are already excessive , are ready for further reductions .
from June next year , this legal centers will lose another 30 percent of its federal funding .
the director of the church centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of parish centers revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only become worse without the lifting of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ lands Munici@@ pal Centers are chron@@ ically supported , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave non @-@ violent relations , people with uns@@ ur@@ able and op@@ pressing debt , families who were dism@@ issed through separation , workers , the ung@@ od@@ ed way - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will be cut by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means thousands of hil@@ ar@@ ating people from Queensland to be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for the General Friends of General and Bundes@@ la@@ iz@@ ations as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to aband@@ on these medi@@ ations as soon as possible , so that people can get the help they need in legal problems .
last year the country government filled its commitments to raise funds for leg@@ g@@ ai@@ ds on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of community care centres and their customer community , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k will invest in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign was indic@@ ted after staff supp@@ os@@ edly sold
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign was indic@@ ted for un@@ in@@ action after it was told that their campaign leader for North Carolina in February had been directed to a fire@@ arm on a staff while they were traveling in a je@@ ep .
the incident was described in an indic@@ t@@ ment which was submitted on Wednesday at the Landes@@ gericht of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program for the campaign in this federal state .
Bord@@ ini had been waiting to have been waiting for monthly that the issue would be regulated internally before he rep@@ lic@@ ated that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;

after having placed himself in the local and regional Kamp@@ agn@@ ation , Bord@@ ini had already made the same experience with Philli@@ p , he gave in the dock .

the indic@@ t@@ ment occurs only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential election as he said to a crowd in North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment Man &quot; - should take action - should take action in case of his ri@@ vals Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge .
the m@@ umps campaign was clear that the media would have gri@@ pped up his words from the context , and that he would not rise up to violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint requests for damages from the campaign to the violation of due di@@ ligence and Philip because of the bodily injury and lead @-@ of psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4th September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the SD@@ P and CD@@ U are held .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is representative for the opinion of the opinion of the im@@ penet@@ rated institutions IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government of government in the north is almost farther , this is not possible according to the surveys in Berlin .
in both Bundes@@ länder the SPD is however the strongest party and could have achieved good chances to continue to re@@ ate the Prime Minister .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD over@@ thre@@ w the SPD of 35,@@ 6 percent more than five years ago on 24 per cent .
the party saw that according to the survey only just under the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again .
the third place is controversi@@ al between left and the after@@ math .
the left declined by 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D is represented by 19 percent for the first time in Land@@ tag .
the Gre@@ ens despite easy losses with 6 percent ( previously , 8,@@ 7 per cent ) returns to the Schwer@@ iner of Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country with each other .
in the Berlin sales selection , the SPD of the survey was estimated that only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 23,@@ 4 percent .
attached to the Green Party with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 per cent for the first time in the &quot; dep@@ uty @-@ house . &quot;
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pirates would not be missed in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the First Smartphone
e @-@ Mail and internet in time @-@ time : 20 years ago the Nokia @-@ communic@@ ator came on the market .
the successor is domin@@ ating today the world - his maker lived a disaster .
the device wo@@ g nearly half k@@ ilo@@ grams and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ er and larger , therefore it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was quite klo@@ sty .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would be present today for about two sing@@ les with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gig@@ ab@@ yte .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , to the shops and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros you can buy the equipment still on the internet , but they are somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the dormit@@ ory .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Computer Club C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for all @-@ time standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit ag@@ oni@@ zing slowly .
a flas@@ h@@ ator was available , a digital add@@ ress@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be checked similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euro .
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was in 2015 at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody was able to susp@@ end in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator of the start of the smartphone era would be .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the cell @-@ card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented d@@ aster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and cle@@ ared .
the market today master supplier which came all much later than Nokia .
always be online and everywhere that is today for quite a lot of people every day .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple are falling alone 5@@ 55 million pieces .
the global turnover of the units is about 400 billion euros .
for this purpose , the well @-@ going operations of the inn@@ um@@ less App @-@ provider and telecommunic@@ ations .
around the smartphone we have now developed a whole industry .
the key breakthrough to the mass market was only in the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple @-@ boss Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communication , easy to use by touch @-@ screen .
the victory of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had the offspring .
they disappeared eventually , Black@@ berry has to fight .
these are now Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung .
the Smartphone is 20 years after its invention a self @-@ understanding .
the in@@ cis@@ ion now looks the same 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to put away the smartphone also once again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina atmosph@@ eres , in the Siemens &quot; Executive Board , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuous availability is now considered a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must draw the ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only used in our local commun@@ es and throughout London , but will bring renewal and prosperity throughout the country .
for me , the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be accomplished again by creating new possibilities for loc@@ ating and firms near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we are alone about 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport surroundings .
just as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too great .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to the dis@@ appearance , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every one asked question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for a single infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on wit@@ ted growth and to leave a leg@@ acies of skills and employment both at the airport and in the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row that has implemented a £ 11 billion de@@ vol@@ ous infrastructure investment program , from T5 to the five years in a row on the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until T2 , that was built in the one of the two frequ@@ ented dur@@ ot@@ sts of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
London &apos;s London Games were a great success for Britain and I am confident that the He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we bro@@ aden this ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and create he@@ ath@@ row as well as creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad @-@ blocking
for companies that make money with online @-@ value money , according to one of the software versions , ad @-@ blocking attempts to deal with a &quot; cat@@ al@@ - and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would block ad lo@@ op@@ ations on his desktop , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ mail in which it investig@@ ates that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday shared the Facebook with that his des@@ k@@ ite page would change the coding on its advertis@@ ements , in order to detect it &apos;s ex@@ position , which is part of the page of advertising , to make it difficult .
but Ad@@ block proclaimed that there is a new way to deal with the new codes .
in a blog@@ posts wrote the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ und @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the start@@ up Open Source Community and the Um@@ pp already since the invention of sco@@ op lo@@ os@@ ening is &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has been initiated in the battle is a strong Indian for how wor@@ rying indic@@ t@@ edness for the industry have become . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people sco@@ op cur@@ ves , nearly four times so much 2013 .
with over EUR billion daily active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 percent of the terms of advertis@@ ements are drawn .
the company has it on the ad @-@ block on desktop PCs as well as mobile sco@@ op block does not effect any effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large share of revenue , so that Facebook appears the investment of such a p@@ ac@@ ance as wage .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would be &quot; re@@ viewer &quot; to update the people more control over on them .
on Thursday , Facebook , that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying , because they would also be blocking content on the page which are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is no positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , shared a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad @-@ blocking systems are a bl@@ unt means , why we instead have concentrated on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to lay more control over the hands of the people .

the police calls you to be witnesses after a woman in the early hours of dawn on Thursday at a suspected self @-@ murder of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the cant@@ on of Wa@@ iting shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the Dark On@@ es &quot; in an act of des@@ per@@ ation &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Wa@@ iting .
it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years , that was passed by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , who wanted to kill themselves .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said these as well as any witness of the incident to sign up .
it became a investigation method opened , what a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation is , divided Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
but it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a conflict avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the government has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - with which a person ran on the highway on the highway - has decided that the drivers did not assume that a pedestrian along the night on the highway runs as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman of the trad@@ ed killing were released after having passed a man and killed , who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had dr@@ unk and has become un@@ conscious on the street and took the court .
the Court concluded that the police officer rep@@ lied -- which had responded to an emergency method -- on a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the Jud@@ ge .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should register at the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NAS@@ A Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NAS@@ A climate model probably was once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Godd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NAS@@ A developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms that are similar to those researchers .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus could have highlighted with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once more .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the recent simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , refres@@ hed atmosphere and yet slowly hing@@ ed on .
the model also illumin@@ ated the Top@@ ographie of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and spread more quickly dar@@ ken@@ ed .
early Venus prof@@ ited from a sun that was 30 per cent sail@@ or .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS modeling simulation sim@@ ulated the slow rep@@ ur@@ ation of Venus is its meeting side of the sun nearly two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick sli@@ der clouds , which acts like a umbrella in order to f@@ ade the surface of a large part of the sunlight .
the result are average temperatures which are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously suspected of planet research .
although she was once inhab@@ itable , the Venus -- has been exposed to a lot of heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light over the course of several years .
her oceans dar@@ ker and her water v@@ ap@@ or was burned down from the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
when you b@@ illed , there was only a thick atmosphere in carbon dioxide , with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate mod@@ ells at the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy happens as a coach of Avalon
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado Summit on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of the Hock@@ ey Operations , and led to a low level of contribut@@ ors on the decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and gave them that the club will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years I have filled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; vo@@ iced his 50 year old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of summer I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations has to be perfectly adapted to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a co @-@ determination of decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had been hal@@ ted on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy became the winner of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League .
he introduced the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the Pl@@ a@@ yo@@ ffs of Min@@ nes@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ ai@@ ds signed in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ Oil processors rely on talks , putting stri@@ ps out of
the labour struggles in respect of the re@@ mun@@ eration for North @-@ oil workers are exposed , whereas all dispute parties are set for a new discussion on the table , said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil field services Wood Group were spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally carried on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ amp@@ art unions can confirm that we agreed to launch the ent@@ ang@@ process of current streams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks to start the start of next year to address the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike is the first in more than 25 years , a protest against possible wage rates of up to 30 percent .
wood Group donated this year to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressures .
the rating of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage decrease in on@@ shore contrac@@ tor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the needed room to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released for its part thousands of people and plans to aband@@ on their oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries as it re@@ alis@@ es its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re@@ ity with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower cru@@ de prices under pressure , an economic situation , which had been reinforced by the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish Par@@ li@@ fel@@ lowship Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the biggest working disputes which happened since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion euros will be expected to create new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler is the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ clu@@ sters of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped Astr@@ onom@@ y to collect the completed catalog of rotation rates below the stars of the star@@ ches of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data will help the Astr@@ onom@@ ics to understand why stars in the star clu@@ sters are at different rates and in which context the Rot@@ ation periods are associated with the planet development .
&quot; we hope we hear through the compar@@ isons of our results with other star clu@@ sters , to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ ches of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star clu@@ sters that came up around 125 million years ago , are now reaching the adul@@ th@@ ood .
it is now turning on fastest .
at peak rates , this strip sets high amounts of star@@ winds .
as these win@@ ch are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star starts , its rotation @-@ rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star , by demonstr@@ ating the time between the appearance of a disc@@ ern@@ ess star@@ ry -- such as l@@ enti@@ ce -- recogni@@ zes .
the newest catalog of rotation rates points out that solid stars revol@@ less than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ches are turning to smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that prot@@ ru@@ ding rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the star @-@ st@@ aufen of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ide@@ alistic cosmic laboratory to compare the qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the star @-@ christ@@ en@@ ings of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an an@@ chor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there &apos;s a lot more to us about how we would like to know more about how , W@@ ann and why stars will slow down their rotation rates and so to say their &quot; dance sli@@ ppers . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues wrote in detail in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades to be released soon in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a um@@ str@@ itt@@ ener bas@@ eball @-@ Star occurs
the tears ran from Alex Rod@@ rigu@@ ez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days from Base to base .
after his emotional set @-@ up announ@@ cements , the 41 year old professional announced on 12 August to the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays the tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &apos;s to both the &quot; declared 14 @-@ mal@@ ige All @-@ Star @-@ game @-@ participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rod@@ rigu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature under a t@@ enth year deal has been posted an annual 27 million US dollars every year since 2007 .
until the end of the contrac@@ eption , on 31 December 2017 , he acts as a consultant and youth coach - in full sal@@ ary .
as a player paid it Rod@@ rigu@@ ez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 31@@ 14 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas ranking ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays indicate two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
but in the glory hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successfully Rod@@ rigu@@ ez - nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in the field itself , its appearance outside the square has been controversi@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded in 2009 between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 he was blocked because of a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis @-@ sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rod@@ rigu@@ ez is considered the main n@@ ud@@ ite for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 because I have had 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rod@@ rigu@@ ez at that time .
even his f@@ are@@ well @-@ days does not go straight away .
while many Bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage again in their last games , Rod@@ rigu@@ ez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game &quot; : &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rod@@ rigu@@ ez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the conditions with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate is cancelled due to sympathy by fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Arch@@ ri@@ val Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en Jin@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Dest@@ inski are first d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases
wi@@ ped out : because of a positive d@@ op@@ ting sample , weigh@@ er us@@ inski from Poland in Rio do not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ones .
a wis@@ ely ath@@ ering could have been won almost a med@@ al .
before the seventh and early competitions , the first official d@@ op@@ ones , the Olympic Games became known in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers Ch@@ en Bau@@ yi , 3000 @-@ Meter barriers made from Bulgaria and the Polish weight of Adrian Dest@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical pre @-@ athle@@ tics competitions , these messages occur during the period .
at Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tik@@ um hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de had been proven to be used as a mas@@ k@@ able remedy for D@@ op@@ ing@@ sub @-@ distances .
the International Sport@@ court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon at the time to exp@@ ire their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place finish in the final more than 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medals .
on Friday he would have to participate in the footh@@ ills of about 50 m of the style of style .
Ch@@ en has filed an opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation at the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it@@ ated Xin@@ long in a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ court CAS and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the restoration of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio sick@@ ened the news of the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my forty test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an unbelievable shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the light@@ box . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is intended to act with the forbidden substance at the ble@@ d@@ op@@ ing@@ medium EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa became pro@@ visional pro@@ visional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive .
Bulg@@ arians &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ iko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately turned out with criticism of the Ath@@ eni@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ l@@ ete does not pull the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see Bul@@ gar@@ es under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , about all the weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ charged nation may not take part in Rio .
on Friday also was the case &quot; Adrian del inski &quot; known , the London Olympic champion in the class until 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested three days ago on the an@@ ab@@ ed ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both con@@ ride the intake , however , they are not allowed to launch in the class up to 94 kg .
in front of the athle@@ tic season it is especially the case Dan@@ et@@ owa a further heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the world @-@ association IAAF had banned the whole Russian team to an exception because of system@@ atical D@@ op@@ ings launched in Rio , even in Rio , numerous poor news produced in Rio .
in the swimming sport the former ties have also taken care of the athletes in China for fier@@ ce conflicts also between athletes .
so at the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ an Sun Yang hard .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium more than 200 m of the style I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was at the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested in Chinese champion@@ ships positively to the stim@@ ul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month cur@@ ri@@ culum .
data cl@@ ow : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ ackers her ran@@ som
programmer from press@@ to @-@ Mal@@ ware currently aimed at current companies - and are successful .
according to a current survey of Mal@@ ware @-@ defense experts Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed firms in the past twelve months have been at least once , partial several victims of an attack with black@@ mailing software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of the companies have already been the goal of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware &apos;s ext@@ or@@ tion .
40 per cent of the victims they agreed to use the solution required by the perpet@@ rators in order to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the offen@@ ders speci@@ alize their re@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes from attack on corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential ran@@ som well falls considerably higher than those at private use .
&quot; we are monitoring a start@@ ling fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs have been designed to send advertising .
then we discovered the offen@@ ders of the ext@@ or@@ tion software for himself .
only private users had the target , but the change to company attacks was stag@@ gering over the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , she specifically looks for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as according to Archi@@ ving images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the presses .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ graphic Bit@@ coin .
but where at private use the personal photo database is at stake , it is about companies about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls when a y@@ ans@@ om@@ ware fails .
22 percent of the German companies affected by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 per cent had to even lower business operations , in case of a case people were in life @-@ threatening .
in Germany , many hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say the victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pays &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of firms who pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in operation .
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the security researchers analysed by F @-@ Secure the user area and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money .
they declare their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free @-@ accessible Support websites or any other example files .
and will rede@@ em individuals after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies must pay partly hard and five @-@ dig@@ it sum@@ s pay for their data un@@ encryp@@ ted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware pro@@ press@@ ing , the h@@ ackers will always be more professional and share the work , the safety experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of Anti@@ virus @-@ providers of Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
more likely it is that it is about three or four persons .
the programmers sell their poll@@ ut@@ software then in the form of a software building to the actual black@@ mail@@ ser .
the existing mal@@ ware products were created by the Mal@@ ware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a adaptation tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be altered , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the presses are then looking for more h@@ acker to spread the fresh purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissioned another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per in@@ calcul@@ able calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually supervis@@ es the crimin@@ als then sp@@ ammer with the spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the meantime , the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known by many companies that guarantee their data .
over 50 percent of companies involved in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on this , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware will be able to ab@@ ide by file @-@ back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
consequently , the perpet@@ rators already follow new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threats to successful fatigue , thre@@ aten the perpet@@ rators with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calcul@@ c@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the damage potential is still higher than ever after type of data .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator will continue to take new goals on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con illustrated safety researchers , how it could get used with the Internet in thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a l@@ ament@@ ed heating is quite well worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ r@@ ator then instead of the heating in the future will block a whole production road in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware might also be a topic in the Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda all want to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pé and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sound fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , who was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz has actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V looks rather small , the passengers have much space in the front row as well as in the case , it does not affect any place too .
the materials of the interior are well processed and act pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is falling down there .
versatile as comparable vehicles is HR @-@ V in the storage room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 453 l at high @-@ quality and 10@@ 26 l available in reverse back @-@ back , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical as it sounds : the sitting areas of the back@@ bank can be lo@@ wer@@ ed like Kin@@ os@@ essel and thus offer storage space , from the floor up to blan@@ kets 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk area is well venti@@ l@@ ated , however , the loader height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l Diesel with 88 kW / 120 PS speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide @-@ scale ranges .
however , he is likely to turn his work hard down .
encouraging is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another motor@@ ization : a 1.5 @-@ l pet@@ rol with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an om@@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the ste@@ ering may be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested Top @-@ Version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;

two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .

of course , holi@@ day@@ makers get back only money after their journey if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly to be found in the hotel .
this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have inher@@ ited the same symptoms .

better traffic control on the motorway trail br@@ inger
it is regularly updated on the road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law should be extended .
this is good news for all the car &apos;s drivers , who stand in the traffic @-@ traffic on the ambient street every evening in the traffic @-@ road , if they go over the Autobahn ( A 43 ) .
the establishment of road building extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler Street the right @-@ off road to 700 meters .
drivers can then insert directly from the hammer street on the right .
the major advantage : the traffic tells the earliest possible time , whereby the overall thr@@ ust of the operation on the multi @-@ road section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 is improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U fac@@ tion in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the motorway exit on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is more nervous the motor@@ ists especially between 17 and 7 pm .
week@@ days from back to the bridge across the slo@@ pp@@ mo@@ wer road and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the N@@ adel@@ öh@@ r on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler street .
from here , the traffic is only reflected in the motorway bridge .
the second lane had to be built mainly in the years ago .
the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge no longer possesses the required carrying power , in order to be able to absor@@ b above all the heavy @-@ load transport .
how long this Eng@@ pass and the associated traffic jam is going to last , the constant state shall not say .
however , with years to count : because the bridge has an official resi@@ dual period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the dispute settlement , the company has deliber@@ ately sought after the busi@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities to count .
the transport takes place on Tuesday and Wednesday at the job@@ site .

rain instead of star@@ ving : hope of weather @-@ resistant
the weather has made the star lad@@ ders in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a rich through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was po@@ orly suited for clouds and rain , the heavenly spectac@@ le to observe , said the president of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will certainly see many star@@ ters in the sky .
the star@@ ters is Persian , which belong to 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star@@ fish .
they have their name because they appear to come out of the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that goes on the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , one is ever@@ lasting around . at night one is rest@@ less awake in the morning , in the morning it is far from the W@@ eck@@ er@@ kl@@ ing@@ du to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institute it has about a quarter of adult sleep problems and over ten percent , their sleep frequently or lasting than not relaxing .
how do you express problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are multiple causes under@@ lie , stresses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aver , Head of the German Society for Schlaf@@ Research and Schlaf@@ medizin .
what you understand it is but the In@@ som@@ man is never a inhal@@ ation and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess .
just the per@@ me@@ able feel many people as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , head @-@ member in the German Building Medical Association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , mental or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medicines are stuck .
not rarely is the ins@@ cri@@ bing expression of a different disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake @-@ up is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ap@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that different factors be@@ aten to each other .
who has for example has a sli@@ pped disk , can lie badly , w@@ acht all two or three hours and begins bl@@ ur@@ ably to complain about all @-@ day problems and safety , &apos; We@@ ap@@ ing is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you talk to your doctor ?
those who have never sleeps over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and the day is affected , should go to the doctor , itor We@@ ap@@ d .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ postpon@@ ed , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily pass@@ able , has vo@@ icing fluctu@@ ations or physical symptoms such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sle@@ eves , it is important to find the causes .
as treatment options , among other things , behaviour changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping @-@ coated tablets only in exceptional and at most for two weeks - in@@ query .
sleeping @-@ medic@@ s in Germany hardly has , stresses Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why one should first turn to the veter@@ in@@ arian for sleeping problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we@@ pt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can clar@@ i@@ fies with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should come into the sleep laboratory , and what happens there ?
for exam@@ ining in the dormit@@ ory rates , for example with snor@@ ing with respir@@ ation , in disease @-@ like day@@ time or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder , explained fe@@ ver .
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; please do not take a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after the sal@@ v@@ ages you go to bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose @-@ br@@ ille , a chest strap , and a g@@ lowing at fingers .
also , a camera is drawn to the ceiling to sleep .
how can suffer@@ ers get the problems under the handle ?
there are quite a lot of adjust@@ ing screws , where you can put a better sleep .
We@@ ap@@ ons count on : regular sleep and standing times , not too long in bed , do not sleep well , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol supp@@ le , and at night do not look at the watch - then you start to count immediately , and that is quite and certainly not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp have missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler had expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appointing the DS@@ V teams in the Olympic team .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time at the short trail of World Championships in Doha and presented his first world records at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V ath@@ l@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler on Facebook are p@@ oured in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ team @-@ mate .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic @-@ winner receives 20,000 € pre @-@ mie and a jungle @-@ w@@ ren 15@@ 0,000 € was to be wondering at no one about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the convey@@ or system in swimming sport is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls , however , very good .
in this way , we cannot compete with countries which do not promote very much and do not see as closely as on the topic of d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler had to be reported already nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled for a certain period before the World Cup / OS of independent controllers of W@@ ada / fin@@ a must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands the election in Hamburg , which now operates an ic@@ oc@@ ele . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Por@@ ters were arrested
professional slide at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civilians were held at the Düsseldorf police held at the age of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pa@@ edi@@ bles had committed as ban@@ de several bags and bags .
against 21.@@ 30 pm , civil officials realised in the area of the International Airport Düsseldorf , which was known to the police officers from the last theft of the theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July this year and were collabor@@ ative , work @-@ prepared and particularly professional .
the specialists of the Cri@@ mean Comm@@ iss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can see the thi@@ eves which have come back to Germany only , four deeds .
they had a total of more than 15,@@ 000 Euros .
alt@@ ar@@ et , a few Lin@@ den@@ b@@ äum@@ chen , inter@@ cep@@ ted with a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain affects the first glance , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from east to west , one gets along play golf courses , a refres@@ hing nur@@ sery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades over .
on the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; m@@ lowing .
opposite to a Li@@ dl , who shall also be demol@@ ished soon , will be built : until 2017 a house is designed here with high windows and 133 new flats .
article about this &quot; trendy quarter &quot; as the responsible property company Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain , are illustrated in recent weeks however preferred with com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of flats , on the ground floor are still open spaces and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year H@@ enkel had been repeatedly called for a hard approach to the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after on June 22nd , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were threatened , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on the spot , with@@ held parts of the street and kept visitors from having to enter the house with the number 94 .
meantime , renovated building workers on behalf of the uns@@ known house owners the spaces .
on July 13 , a Berlin administration court decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and a day later went the police and workers under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer morning , the road works peaceful : parents walk with children walking , people sitting at the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others enter@@ t@@ ained vor@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i .
very close to the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main or@@ ge of many inhabitants : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the area since 1999 , and Jana * , who stood here three children , above all by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern from rising inter@@ com@@ ets and dis@@ bur@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who kno@@ w@@ ish more deeply Poli@@ ze@@ isch@@ utz before v@@ and@@ al@@ ous left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between the land@@ lords and their neighbours , does not exist as obviously .
Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter , which also has a lower average living in comparison to the rest of the city , and has high poverty @-@ risk .
also houses and the home @-@ born projects are already long since the area : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the mainstre@@ aming had been sp@@ elled by the big police panel , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and partly still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the urban district of the past few years has increasingly become a mag@@ net for tourists and elec@@ toral liner from all over the world : with them now the inhabitants of the G@@ DR @-@ Roman times and former owners of their area .
this is also noticeable in the rental , which has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one reali@@ zes them in used sli@@ ces or fresh coated fac@@ ades , which were applied with color .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality such as bodily injury , according to their statistics , according to polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of criminal off@@ ences make damage , the ten@@ den@@ zi@@ ell rather the re @-@ built and newly renovated houses meet .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a flat house next to the controversi@@ al of 94 , cannot be dis@@ closed by uncertainty .
as for violence , it is important : people in 94 are their neighbours , which are not meant to be .
the famous burning vehicles also give it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
for the gradu@@ ated archit@@ ect@@ in , her street is not a crime com@@ bust@@ ion , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliber@@ ately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
therefore it was also important that the inhabitants get their road back : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claim the clear@@ ness about the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : through sigh@@ ted new buildings in ancient buildings , who im@@ pose the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately cond@@ omin@@ ium flats , which are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not so well sad@@ dened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I be absolutely non @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if one never stops someone ?
it uses fru@@ stration to all sides of fru@@ stration , also with the police and the residents .
for fe@@ eder that spar@@ es a little bit of color @-@ bom@@ bs , Kerstin has little understanding : the house@@ projects and the le@@ ft@@ ist scene belonged to the area .
who put it should be aware - just like someone who draws to a pub that can complain that bad about noise can complain .
all persons asked only with first names asked why not to be called with their real name
Ur@@ bach : Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officers
Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organisation .
furthermore she is a social worker on site .
since July Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ical team supports the management of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , Arbeitsk@@ reis , refugee , administration , authorities and who else can mit@@ ig@@ ate them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reg@@ ine Client from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ er@@ legen@@ de Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , who has a problem above all .
thus , some - less sp@@ ot@@ ting than rather on the multitude of desired tasks are purpos@@ eful - meant as the administration wanted to leave the place .
sear@@ ched for was an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a more intense w@@ ool of Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
however , administrative work is not its central area , says Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as power @-@ value .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent section for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client , that Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ or@@ a- and full @-@ time actors supported .
there are big and small issues , organizational , human and understanding issues .
soon new containers face in the Was@@ p
a serious problem has been to be recognized for some time , apartments for the connecting times , which have been recognised .
for the connector , the municipalities are responsible .
you must accommodate the refugees in own or rented premises .
the cost of building , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the council office on Kommun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment .
the search for quite a time has been very difficult for some time .
de facto the management does not find private apartments .
it does not so far so far , be instruc@@ ted on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
hence , common apartments need to be viewed as it is so beautiful .
so soon new container will be placed in the washing machine .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , the Reg@@ ine client and Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed base , there are traine@@ es , training courses , training courses , One @-@ euro @-@ jobs and hel@@ ical activities for refugees and migrants that must be b@@ lown or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building or help ho@@ oks , do our charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , such as Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive impact .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but work does not mean only work .
the day are a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and Customer .
the people would have to develop an artist @-@ feeling .
so do you need special offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so also diving here administration and volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must declare to the refugees that it even lasts and they can be sensible at the time , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who eventually develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone , thir@@ dly not work and be unn@@ ütz , who will never integrate itself .
the distinct majority was motivated .
troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting , however , says Customer honestly , &quot; people , with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear from radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , Reg@@ ine customers say clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher can call nai@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a balance would be able and would not want to ex@@ clude it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sens@@ it@@ ised are the hel@@ pers but already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have fear that the attacks can bring them completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so you will need to keep the main and hon@@ orary locally and in the region according to activities .
they are always in the background that soon a new thr@@ ust of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
this question clearly has to answer , scru@@ b themselves the policy .
actually , it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there where we want to go , &quot; says Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine Client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher too has already been praised that the people can be reasonably priced .
this is currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them both women agree .
the political situation is so complicated , since there is no simple answers .
