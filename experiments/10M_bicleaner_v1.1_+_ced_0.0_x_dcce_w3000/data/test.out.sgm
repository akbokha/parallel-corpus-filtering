<seg id="1">Clinton and Vocals Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreements - they want to both Clinton and Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competition are in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental resource.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a key, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the State.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep it small in doubt and warns how the state of economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to taxed the economy to death, and to put it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the other hand, it would be quite different, losing Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will withdraw regulations massively, and it makes itself strong for a wide-ranging tax reform with lower controls and for private people and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton is saying, The State has specific tasks to be able to open up their disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes for the rich would increase, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the changes, Trump and Clinton are almost wormed.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty-wing of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be no internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-power stations and uplift the coal production in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far-protected areas that wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton intends to respond to renewable energies with its investment program:" "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two rivals are not too far away.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazier trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US do not want to isolate international trade - but simply keep American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be better paid, demands about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollar is a hunger pwage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not entirely clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rup, then he says he could not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side stands Trump that wants to escape the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics follow him, so that the budget deficit would only grow bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other side, Clinton, who at least want to demand from the rich, that they will pay more taxes, and their critics are saying, more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give his hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter-player in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot conceive of the expression that Ankara is going to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the glove, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile is pallied and he radiated hardly any heating itself, even for its restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the other hand spoke to his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day describing a newspaper that Erdogan could have heard so as if never had anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm to me would seem to imply the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin summed, sustainable chairs, showed that the State of Russia had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first one he mentioned in his demonstration: the downing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to time was wreckoned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin made up and accused Ankara to please Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The going was even bigger, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cousin building again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long the nationally controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed that the Turks would pay for all the guilt.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the most serious, the allegations of senior officials had benefited from the illegal oil-trade in areas of Syria that is controlled by the Islamic State of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Eventually this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erdogan the excuse he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ankara lies with the advantages of a ceasefire obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily used all friends who can get it after he was last month at a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia travel insurance and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a late summer of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week forecast the state-TV show cheap fruits and vegetables once the Turkish agrarian imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it follows: "tourists staying there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furifueled on the West as it considers the reaction to the tried to impose a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continuing Groll about the snail-empo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the picht is to draw from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian leader won in Ankara with certainty for ensuring that he searched for elected state organs for elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is pleasurable to Moscow in itself a self-understanding that even has changed a profound fear of rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey, one how it once said to me a analyst once, "alliance of outsiders": two countries, which violates themselves from the West and feel bad and now fencing.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two remaining.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria where Moscow recently gave their role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey can help their antagonistic sites.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could signifies that after almost three hours of first talks, both Presidents met on the press conference that they had not even touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey Complete it to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect dispute as the NATO member of Turkey requested the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two leaders talked at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="16">I say now, we are not able to pursue any global goals, but to pursue local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the clients among these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and will increase the perception of the various brands in his sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop in the bank of brands because how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the officers.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago when we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks.</seg>

<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the narrated Trust prize of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed for the special officer for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin has arranged without the reason" "" "dismissal Ivanov's responsibilities as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was a substitute member since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his degree at the prestigious President of Moscow International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message of Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he was later to the executive chef and the Office of the government of government.</seg>
<seg id="10">About his appointment he said to Putin: "thanks for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your activities as a state of laws and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivanov that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the busiest fists Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet intelligence services, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men accepted that the staff of the staff at their own wish.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ächelns for the cameras, here are only a few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is the consequence of a kind of power fight?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official argument - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, on once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead on great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks about Putin, who were quoted on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said "It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to trust every post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Minister of Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin's former member of the national security officer KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessicherhism (FSB), he was appointed to the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his Deputy Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin gave power to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was thought that Ivanov could have been President of Russia after Putin's second mandate as a third presidential term had existed against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, closest ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister, before he became the president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, which pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child to play no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, screens in the last decade of many beaments.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go there is about getting people from the sofa and to become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were first created for the video games that were first created for the video games (later created from this a sign series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena in Popculture, the interest in the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July are somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="9">The launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overburdened the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon was a lot more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémons who are tracked with a GPS as soon as they were once found, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the Wahn and sprang for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable rise in steps that puts the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35.000 users retraced, the Washington Post recently received that within two days of launch of the game, the number of surveyed people, which exercise every day 30 minutes, ranging from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to take" "" "walk from the sofa" "" "to get active in the sofa" "" "and" "" "to be active every day, because many public messages are boring and come from people who look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overevaluated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sport, reduces its chances of suffering to cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weighting control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that you have fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people make even new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are maces, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone Apps, like FitBit could already follow our activity before, they have no reason to exercise sports as it does this play.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its friction, and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success there will be more games to join the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and helping many people on hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabon and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I premieres in Turns in Turns and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been working in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turnerves, Simone Biles, Gabon Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who taught for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the catholics in, round, makes every pride.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has paved the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one below the female gymnast.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year we were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabon was celebrating a surprising Olympiagewinner and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, the world was able to witness witness the incredible performance of the triple world cup in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they waited unwaited, but the masterful Gymastikonins.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual american, who won gold on an individual multi-battle event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the tip of this sport, but we don't see the classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabon and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "last Five" "" "because the next Olympiamanna will have only four turrets in the team. besides this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is so that Turns is an expensive sport and turner manship primarily in private gyms that will be maintained for training, marketing, competition, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers lie in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner will receive its entire training and that is a deductive and long-term engagement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes, since they started with the gymnasies.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to be inspired by the congregations of innumerable, young girls, which are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a well-being and more accessible turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my gym with 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have free and affordable turns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban people (especially black and hispanic) provided and national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we are expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline, and determination to the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who brings thousands of young girls to care for the gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the olympic Mannschaftsgolds and thanks, Fass you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to get healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "working measures won't reach anything of the only little but had already overloaded teams and service providers, and prepare the patient, enlegisers and their families only worries, distress and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">In the last two months, we talked to the commee of the assistants and with the Ministry of Health, and other ministries has responded positively to concerns about the premundy and whistlebings.</seg>

<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with aspirin effectively in reducing further heart attack and stroke cases with people who had already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">By a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor we are glad that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination boards: who is actually buying cakes?</seg>
<seg id="2">Solitary men medium-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you switch to the commentary box to sow him under the pseudonym for non-avenues of men suffering, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multiplied redevelopment of acoustine is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but on Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all predictions after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely sharper group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate ers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time to spend (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would follow a message report on TV, I would follow the camera, while in the middle of a busy road in Soho run, a humble track record, and wild bounce, my hands can keep and something determining what: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly assigned to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where formerly independent sellers are located - there is still a handful of fantastic turntables specialities.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mixes by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle aged men) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, one woman, presumably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This resonates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail; I am not followed him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to purchase records, which he could not afford to buy them as they appeared, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late sixties, early 70ies who appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, when I was probably something too young to buy it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who buy plates, are more introverted and happy to spend time, and adds: "I do not smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray believes that many customers that he meets on the YouGov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of folks that have been influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback, and see it again, to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">By the talks I managed, people usually have escaped from their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once bought their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would be the boom of followers of the record revised flash of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the innonal emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica in order to detect that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customer calls for the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans can feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw from the stability of familiar actuators, objects, the happier youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as collectors so I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" flames a staff of a plate-stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they have not yet been heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey was also out that 41% have a record player, whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news reports, I would probably look very worried, while I bladed by a stack on Bossa Nova Kompilitations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (numbers: three men mid-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came here only recently and said," "" "I do not have a record player, but I would like to buy a radial plate, so I can put it into a shelf" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-loaded, less musical.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who will come up slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Stop that has devoted to the pboard nearly a whole floor has an open audience when I roe deer.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and women aged men.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the imaginable stores - Wild Beasts neuester synthesizer and sexbepacker pop instead of experimental jazz mostly from speakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks quite lonely, but nagging psychologically traumata are hard to be adjustable if someone is standing next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs for several minutes in the shop and looks at the variation of sale available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more like a window inherited piece than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so the collectors of records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of plates is... "it is driving with a loving sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of record debarter is to have inspired: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the note that Jeans-hotpants take, observe a group of young teenage boys, beg for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a crossover turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are only pure decorative, some are so far up that it is impossible to attach them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers might want to send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group which has more time and money than others, while the one is the most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows, that the results of YouGov agree, they leave at least in record stores in Soho, the great number of female collectors and turntables, which exist in reality, record stores and in Onlineforen, untaken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or at office.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning certainly not with the strolling through record stores of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while being mapped with the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator who raging over the shoulders of little sensory men.</seg>

<seg id="1">Great Britain holt Silver in 7-er Rugby, after Fiji Masterclass Gold takes up</seg>
<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby came last on Thursday evening to a abrupt halt at last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were marked with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji ables a master class at handling, side-stepping, push-back, line-line and rower force to win gold - their first Olympiamedaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defeat was turned off by the not too bad Trophy of silver medal - British fourth over this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they smashed New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could be dropped to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, Fiji in this form could have made a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a solace for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis boss-trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago it lost in Ryan of every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here it is only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This workbook will be wehoused but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderfull and made the attacks GBs made of fun seprall.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co. an, when you would run into driving busses. the World Series winners went to 5-0 to top, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai continued another attack on the right corner which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly has the ball broadly defined.</seg>
<seg id="16">A precarious raging of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but Fiji only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touchdown, and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-fiff and there was still more than a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preceded by further weak tacklings of the GB teams and rushed to the line to take a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji to be born to play the 7, while I still have seeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB lead to fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijiian gap... for whole four minutes, what was good for the conditions of the first half time, until Josue Tuisova ran after a excellant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt to GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game ran for a long time in favor of Southern Europe's consular, whose fans scars, flags and danced on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i-cake with another attempt within the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle lowered, the Fijis hugged and the GB kicked crushing beaten in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the days Fiji Japan had conquered Fiji Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and pressed South Africa in a crack semi-finalmatch from the race - the British transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half after the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footed and achieved a gate among the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant belated tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for the rowdeg</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no palerting gold than with these games and what will mean.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing down to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if it were only those who sat at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was allpresent as she saw the second Olympiagold in a row without headbands in a row that laid the first women in the history of British sport that laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter were improper use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletinside who goose over the surface with the elegance of sponge, which is not reflecting the nature of the triumphs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the Ruins there is a battalion willing to help make the difference and it was nobody assistant than the coach, who did not know if he was able to survive this day when cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had wind-cancer who is operable and this did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, he spread out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a quite bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, could start what the interruption was held to a minimum, if that under such circumstances is the right term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at one time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing of itself is already a challenge, but this makes it an even greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inviolability of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-bending morning something more than usual and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, which was as captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that is perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeatedly, how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore, a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have a better person for the trainee or wish a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm that could not compete with their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams ran out from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very much trapped.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>

<seg id="8">Through regular co-operation, seniors may have socialised and maintain social contacts.</seg>

<seg id="18">By Liedtexte and particularly tunes, he denied themselves denying themselves in the long term events.</seg>
<seg id="19">At singing the head is also requesting a special performance, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, exercise so, not only concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the acknowledgment that one learns through the singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I am too long for something, I will be better and watchful over me - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>

<seg id="30">Sing someone from the acquaintances in a senior choir, you can simply join.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they had shot three gates during a 6-1 winner about Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American Feldhockeyteam of women at a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually be a memorable output, but Bam (27) said it could not remember the ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not belonging to the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, this knows it: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons lying on the first place, which remains unstruck after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">The United States and the United States will succeeding on Saturday last night of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which the two within their group will gain from six teams of the first and second place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The initial plateau is going to last somewhat longer out of the way that the other group lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex because of their success story, four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in hands (their two older sisters gave sports at the Drexel Universität), with 16 years she became a member of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympiad in 2008 because it could not qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the year 2012, in which for her and her team all seemed nearer.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, the coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a culture-change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work officer in London we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to snatch the ruin.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the torch in the first half of the game with a backhand from the Nahum area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone in the tournament without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter, until they took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She finished a sprint with the flat ball over the left side, then moved into the middle and turned the ball into the gate around the Americans a 2-0 guidance.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last four-district.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the doorkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>

<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly changing and inescapable, a rapid run between competition and quest.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the olympic fackel itself is a burning stab, which is passed from the wristrustling to swimmers to the swimmers to the triathleten.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch the TV to read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour on the queue in the coffeshop, without a Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman swarm with grasschen, could have been produced under these well known names that would be sent to Prime Time, rebuilt through sponsors and well-sensitive TV commercials when he would be a swimmers, turner or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame is not illuminated every event the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, in part in the shadow are the sports, which are not generally accepted: airbrush, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I might recognize those arguments for my particular darling, let me direct the attention to the discreet charms of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has already been an olympic event since 2000 it had been a olympic event since 2000, it was the last 16 years so sparse that many people asked, did not know that it is a Olympiasportart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA has sent Athlete to competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline and until 2012 has had a athletes, who made it up to the end of the end.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong out China and Rosia MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jump has a certain outsiders, partly because it sounds fitting for the unenlightened ears of a clowns school than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an adventurous enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the karmic trembling of his never wanted to end up - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports, which it's essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" is known by the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as the springboard. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, Having and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>

<seg id="24">Two-long athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is almost straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hopeful must continue in their quest for gold further, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes round and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They chase not only the bridle or the output wall, but in the TV transfer also another cavity destination: the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even touch a spectator at tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even with the look of these games as something fatigued.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline-jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A upward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallude off, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes down, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here, there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, not vault in distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and endorsement of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; which the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>

<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one which is likely to overlooked in general tumult.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig demonstrators were killed while the clashes with the police were killed with archeers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight to interrupt?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the more stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of strengthening of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months the protests against the government conquered the country and went into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people cramped on the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses called that policemen were shot on zig unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Changing shifting videos about protests, presumably by the last or beginning of this year, show like security-people young people hit with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now demanding an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services collaborate closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, get as much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian business expansionable in the considerable rapidity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendant in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, which governors were effectively transferred to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many have been sent to exile or prison, or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire young protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground-use up to the stranglehold imposed in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a extended election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tension along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this zacky, controversial line called for in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were enforced in recent years more or less forced to protect Turbulenzen and rebuild itself again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of banness under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, since cheaper smartphones were becoming more frequently used and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government lock the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are doing at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via Internet Proxies, conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians showed that they gathered so at protein.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons of prosperous the amharas, the predominantly Christian highlands meet, in politics and economy, while they are the Oromos of whom many Muslims are living and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests in areas of Amhara and Oromos took place.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have felt that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who are about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "Mr Meles, a former Rebels leader, was until his death at a non-councils of illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man to think about the corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in use early signs of dissatisfaction and special officer to deal with opponents and make them undetrimental.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analysis" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unopaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services rendered by the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia was experienced such a moil in 2005 after thousands against elections were protested by the government and were subsequently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following sweeps were killed many protesters, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest was passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "development experts" "" "Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructural Planning, like the new Pendlerzug" "", "as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, Protestant in gondar, a shamanic city, of Tigray performed shops and the hatred against the Tigray is becoming increasingly active in social media.</seg>

<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for uronic flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they were reported recently that it has closed this base.</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy on Friday the last controversy caused by the campaign that his multiple repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State of Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarixed new questions about the communication skills of the President of the Republican party whether it is able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also leads his fellow clays, who are trying to take him into shelter during a eventful phase, to explain to the actual position, declarations that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the announcement in an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the statement on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump, he was simply sarkic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a row of interviews, he meant the allegation perfectly seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help to diminish the statement by remembering it that Mr. Obama wants to annihilate him, the Republican President wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism prasselt to Mr. Trump herab, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign for falling surveys on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew a strong criticism of himself when he said, the Russians were asked Mrs. Clinton emails, but he later said "Natarky I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics, and then return to ruin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how to get certain messages from his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary," depending on the way the reaction falls. "said Ruth West, a communication-sexist that observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to hold its statements about it, so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpening the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has an even estimated sound, since its surveys have further declined.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist who was released on Friday showed a lead with a great advantage in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative expressions, he accused his critics often to distort his statements or to understand their humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has led his loyal mitigation into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how provocative may also like his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercessors, had great effort to defend candidates today in CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "so Mr. Giuliani said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements was asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it butbish, totally wrong and therefore it happened because he tarried the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream republicans attempt to argue that the government served under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as the Secretary of State, ISIS allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East to aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, and bowed them to tread upon each of his words, and to be preset against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He married the "poor, jämmerling" TV experts who try to understand him and said, "You Can't it!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats spotted on Mr. Trumps excuse as only one further proof that he is inappropriate for the President's Office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönland: the oldest whist is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenlandhaie usually come to surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed after a study on board the historicship Sanna back into the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie have only dealt with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mostly swims of the Greenlandhai along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it appears on average just 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, speeds up the five meter long animal on satte 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a robe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of loneliness was shaped, but seems to be a bullet for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate of a Grönland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein, from Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span that means a world records.</seg>
<seg id="12">Though the evolution of evolution has long been that Greenlandhaie are stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only faults the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenlandhaie are hard to observe, lastly, they live especially in the ice sea, in front of the thin-populated coastal regions of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface mostly in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyles of Greenlandhaie researchers know according to little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your time-pentaghen they, when they set up six animals with one radio station in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make this haie nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robe, another one had shocked the jaw of a young icarist.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly jages them sleepy animals or patrouilliers at the bottom of the ice meager and look carcasses who torrent out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as a confecing out of the depth of North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analysed them with the carbon-14-method of the nucleus of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eyelid emerges before the birth of the sharks, which included in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a striking a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, after the early 1950s, your birth should therefore be bigger amounts of that radioactive carbon-based plant in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In that with 220 centimetres in the smallest animal, the lens-core of the Linear, on the other hand, a little surplus-shot at carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it might have celebrated his 50th birthday in the year 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenlandhaie had normal carbon-14 amounts, that arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-2-14-clock showed a 493 cm long Greenlandhai at the age of 335 years, while the record shark with a 502 centimeters can be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenlandhai-females get only then offspring when they are longer than four metres, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">It was possible to assign the researchers of the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature, and his age was intended for 156 years, the Grönland with the multiplication obviously was at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be the world-directory for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live especially in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenlandwal, in whose speck at the neck, was a 120 year old harp-top, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because of the low temperatures there is often the organism of the animals living there on asparaguses.</seg>
<seg id="36">They thus mature - and altern hurry.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often becomes especially large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal heat is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss from a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is thus more dangerous and should concentrate as early as possible to have as many descendants as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">As a result, a very large animal should be investing more resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow, the Ankerzman took part, who had made his Landsmann Sir Chris Hoy. the jenny and made the legend of pride, having rushed to home a victory of the favorites.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claims four years ago a shocking victory, while Hoy fetched the fifth of six Olympiagoldmedamedals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeats the trick, after being in March at the railway-world championship in London despite the plot, Hoys, only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the operator Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton examined.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they remained, when they saw potential in the villi that unfolds now.</seg>

<seg id="13">A strategy change made a great deal of transformation to slow down in a higher gear to slow him and make it yiely and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as the BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes on when this climbed to the podium.</seg>

<seg id="41">Today the first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of competition, where the Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had been argued yesterday with officials before the qualification and called for him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the final women's contest, the morning continued and ended, avancied Laura Trott, Joanna Rivsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world-time period in 4: 13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB Team relies on his strong railway wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a touch of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London have crossed the expectations for Rio.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas also played in the background, as the resignation of the technical conductors Shane Sutton in April surrounded by Sexismuscular and harassment, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees the first evening of competition in the Velodrome, it looks quite as it could have reached the legendary reputation of GBs, which at the perfect moment has reached its peak again.</seg>

<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that it was completed in 2010 a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, who should have been in effect from November this year, even if there is still a declaration which has been withdrawn from the treaty.</seg>

<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and spread more quickly darkened.</seg>

<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures which are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected of planet research.</seg>

<seg id="15">Her oceans darker and her water vapor was burned down from the ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data clow: so perfide erpressen hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer from pressto-Malware currently aimed at current companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey of Malware-defense experts Malwarebytes to 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surveyed firms in the past twelve months have been at least once, partial several victims of an attack with blackmailing software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies have already been the goal of a Ransomware's extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims they agreed to use the solution required by the perpetrators in order to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The offenders specialize their represser software according to the observations of malwarebytes from attack on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential ransom well falls considerably higher than those at private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are monitoring a startling fast evolution of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes-chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malwareprograms have been designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the offenders of the extortion software for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users had the target, but the change to company attacks was staggering over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, she specifically looks for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as according to Archiving images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of the presses.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryptographic Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where at private use the personal photo database is at stake, it is about companies about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls when a yansomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected by Ransomware, 13 per cent had to even lower business operations, in case of a case people were in life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, many hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health acts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say the victims" "" "pays" "", "it only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of firms who pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the security researchers analysed by F-Secure the user area and contact with the blackmailers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They declare their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free-accessible Support websites or any other example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will redeem individuals after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies must pay partly hard and five-digit sums pay for their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware propressing, the hackers will always be more professional and share the work, the safety experts Chester Wisniewski of Antivirus-providers of Sophos: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely it is that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutsoftware then in the form of a software building to the actual blackmailser.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware products were created by the Malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be altered," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The presses are then looking for more hacker to spread the fresh purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logged in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissioned another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per incalculable calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually supervises the criminals then spammer with the spread" "", "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">At the meantime, the risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that guarantee their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies involved in the Malwarebytes survey rely on this, Ransomware will be able to abide by file-back-ups and Scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Consequently, the perpetrators already follow new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threats to successful fatigue, threaten the perpetrators with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculcations," "" "explains Malwarebytes-chef Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">In this way, the damage potential is still higher than ever after type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrator will continue to take new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Defcon illustrated safety researchers, how it could get used with the Internet in thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a lamented heating is quite well worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrator then instead of the heating in the future will block a whole production road in a factory, Ransomware might also be a topic in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one is everlasting around. at night one is restless awake in the morning, in the morning it is far from the Weckerklingdu to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch-Institute it has about a quarter of adult sleep problems and over ten percent, their sleep frequently or lasting than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do you express problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are multiple causes underlie, stresses Hans-Günter Weaver, Head of the German Society for SchlafResearch and Schlafmedizin.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand it is but the Insomman is never a inhalation and sleepless.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the permeable feel many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, head-member in the German Building Medical Association with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also medicines are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the inscribing expression of a different disorder.</seg>

<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors beaten to each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who has for example has a slipped disk, can lie badly, wacht all two or three hours and begins blurably to complain about all-day problems and safety, 'Weaping is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you talk to your doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who have never sleeps over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and the day is affected, should go to the doctor, itor Weapd.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is downcast, tired, unpostponed, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily passable, has voicing fluctuations or physical symptoms such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleeves, it is important to find the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, among other things, behaviour changes, a cognitive behavioral therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping-coated tablets only in exceptional and at most for two weeks - inquery.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sleeping-medics in Germany hardly has, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "that is why one should first turn to the veterinarian for sleeping problems," "" "wept" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarifies with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should come into the sleep laboratory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in the dormitory rates, for example with snoring with respiration, in disease-like daytime or if you don't find the cause of a sleepy disorder, explained fever.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not take a nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the salvages you go to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-brille, a chest strap, and a glowing at fingers.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also, a camera is drawn to the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get the problems under the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws, where you can put a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weapons count on: regular sleep and standing times, not too long in bed, do not sleep well, do not watch TV to sleep, alcohol supple, and at night do not look at the watch - then you start to count immediately, and that is quite and certainly not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altaret, a few Lindenbäumchen, intercepted with a rest of cobblestones: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain affects the first glance, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from east to west, one gets along play golf courses, a refreshing nursery and a biolades over.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the façade of a gray house someone has "ugly!" mlowing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl, who shall also be demolished soon, will be built: until 2017 a house is designed here with high windows and 133 new flats.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy quarter" as the responsible property company Friedrichshain, are illustrated in recent weeks however preferred with combustible cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents of flats, on the ground floor are still open spaces and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year Henkel had been repeatedly called for a hard approach to the police against the project, the area as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on June 22nd, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were threatened, with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on the spot, withheld parts of the street and kept visitors from having to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meantime, renovated building workers on behalf of the unsknown house owners the spaces.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later went the police and workers under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer morning, the road works peaceful: parents walk with children walking, people sitting at the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, others entertained vorm Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">Very close to the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main orge of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the area since 1999, and Jana *, who stood here three children, above all by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern from rising intercomets and disburfication.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who knowish more deeply Polizeischutz before vandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police between the landlords and their neighbours, does not exist as obviously.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter, which also has a lower average living in comparison to the rest of the city, and has high poverty-risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also houses and the home-born projects are already long since the area: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire mainzer street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainstreaming had been spelled by the big police panel, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and partly still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the urban district of the past few years has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: with them now the inhabitants of the GDR-Roman times and former owners of their area.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rental, which has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one realizes them in used slices or fresh coated facades, which were applied with color.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned so often together with the words" "" "linksautonome violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality such as bodily injury, according to their statistics, according to policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of criminal offences make damage, the tendenziell rather the re-built and newly renovated houses meet.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a flat house next to the controversial of 94, cannot be disclosed by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: people in 94 are their neighbours, which are not meant to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning vehicles also give it right in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the graduated architectin, her street is not a crime combustion, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was also important that the inhabitants get their road back: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claim the clearness about the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to take away: through sighted new buildings in ancient buildings, who impose the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominium flats, which are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not so well saddened," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I be absolutely non-healing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if one never stops someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">It uses frustration to all sides of frustration, also with the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For feeder that spares a little bit of color-bombs, Kerstin has little understanding: the houseprojects and the leftist scene belonged to the area.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who put it should be aware - just like someone who draws to a pub that can complain that bad about noise can complain.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons asked only with first names asked why not to be called with their real name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officers</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner for integration and organisation.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore she is a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle the refugee camp for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogical team supports the management of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, Arbeitskreis, refugee, administration, authorities and who else can mitigate them." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Client from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eierlegende Wollmilchsau, who has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, some - less spotting than rather on the multitude of desired tasks are purposeful - meant as the administration wanted to leave the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a more intense wool of Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as power-value.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent section for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Client, that Annika Deuschle honora- and full-time actors supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small issues, organizational, human and understanding issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers face in the Wasp</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to be recognized for some time, apartments for the connecting times, which have been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connector, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accommodate the refugees in own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of building, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the council office on Kommune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for quite a time has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the management does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not so far so far, be instructed on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hence, common apartments need to be viewed as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new container will be placed in the washing machine.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, the Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed base, there are trainees, training courses, training courses, One-euro-jobs and helical activities for refugees and migrants that must be blown or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building or help hooks, do our charitable work - and this motivates and very neat, such as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But work does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day are a solid structure, say Deuschle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop an artist-feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So do you need special offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also diving here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must declare to the refugees that it even lasts and they can be sensible at the time, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Who eventually develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach anyone, thirdly not work and be unnütz, who will never integrate itself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Troubleshooting, however, says Customer honestly, "people, with whom nothing works." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear from radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "no, Regine customers say clearly," "" "what mancher can call naive" "". "a balance would be able and would not want to exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitised are the helpers but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have fear that the attacks can bring them completely in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So you will need to keep the main and honorary locally and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that soon a new thrust of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly has to answer, scrub themselves the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived there where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Client also makes it clear that the Urbacher too has already been praised that the people can be reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, since there is no simple answers.</seg>
