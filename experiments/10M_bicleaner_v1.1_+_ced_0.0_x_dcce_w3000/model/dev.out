Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not am@@ ic@@ able .
the two wanted to pass on the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the meeting , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington crit@@ ici@@ zed the en@@ during sett@@ ling of Israel and casts a permanent will during the peace process .
through the deal of Obama &apos;s fault of the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
at the invitation of Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , Netanyahu has held a controversi@@ al speech which was partially interpreted as the aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with a reference to the imp@@ ending election in Israel .
in a call , Professor , his girlfriend has shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police , he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog , &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the Family Cro@@ ce of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and another written note that was critic@@ ised on a white block : &quot; I just wanted to do it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was about the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , has already received 300 miles for school grounds , where he was killed and killed by the police for the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door of his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ missions Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ ality employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call then after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took over life , when the police took him to fall .
one day after shooting the university , students and faculty to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees , who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented but maybe difficult teachers .
students said that they were happy in their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where he died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmidt himself held a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both served in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching has 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to be problematic .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who praised the Lamb , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb previously had asked the Delta State University to have asked for a survey of health reasons and said that he has any health problem .
this year he organised only two online courses .
recent changes in the Employment policies of the University signi@@ fied that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him to represent no guarantee for an automatic road to an order as a Assistant @-@ professor .
Universal President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he know nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs imagination . &quot;
these are questions I could no longer answer .
after escape from the campus the police came to Lam@@ bs later than he was back in Mississippi , Ark@@ ans@@ as .
before he was arrested , he k@@ ked with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running along the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university who has 3,@@ 500 students in town with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and began Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he pro@@ mo@@ red in the spring in Pa@@ ed@@ ago@@ gi@@ k .
one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs appointed him as a intelli@@ gent@@ a , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 , when they met common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy , who tried several years to teach her guitar .
he was at the time the women &apos;s warm .
all girls sh@@ mel@@ ted there when he was there , &quot; said ha@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
in the call , Lamb &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house , that was adjacent to a ba@@ it in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were left 15 years ago , but friends were stayed and a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; it was totally destroyed in the soil , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he did not met but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that she was interested in music and blues playing .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail had both past three years ago on a summer year .
later they played together the one or the other G@@ ig .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter to write and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nur@@ se , which worked online for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ ke@@ eper , and sometimes enter@@ tain@@ able coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw him and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night at night 5th September for the last time , after watching its guitar player and a mouth degree ended in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign of something that something was un@@ anim@@ ous .
just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the inaugur@@ ation and j@@ oking together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the initial semester programme and specialized on American U@@ n@@ atives and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of his Br@@ other@@ hood and of the student committee .
on Tuesday the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ veland , on Tuesday evening about 900 individuals , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community participate in a cand@@ le memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Frau Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the M@@ ahn@@ wache as well as the Univers@@ it√§t@@ sch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be included on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans , contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to conf@@ lic@@ ting that the police reported that he made the call , after he had p@@ oured an emergency call upon his wife &apos;s call , but there is no indication that the two ever got married .

Michael J. Fox Cher@@ ts over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat beside me is empty and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I have been a sim@@ ulated se@@ wing and an arm@@ rests of it , with the prin@@ c@@ ess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentation on &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .

UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Secretary Ban Ki @-@ Moon pro@@ claim his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; the almost five @-@ lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support the inclusive negotiations with finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to discuss the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of ministers of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it regre@@ ts that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can make this situation un@@ solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ban said the five permanent members to show off the crisis in Syria , show the same solidarity and unity , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear de@@ part with Iran .
8 survey values that demonstrate that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull the Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys as it has ( yet ) does not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ dig@@ it area and some begin to ask questions about what it means for the chance of nomin@@ ation of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody believes that Tr@@ ump will likely win the Republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts stress that this time was given to Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership to the upcoming Herman C@@ ain , none of which also won a state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognise b@@ umps and start to let their dollars will flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
m@@ umps Pop@@ ular values have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump has announced his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey conducted of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are kept in early countries .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P elec@@ tors GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up@@ set &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent that will tell the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
to be the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio , with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favor@@ it of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would be .
a majority of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans sees tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely crit@@ ici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 per cent of those found in the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans &apos; dict@@ ating Irish vot@@ al voters believe the real temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same figure is in the first drop state of the nation , the federal state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the personality for a com@@ mander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent do not think that he will not have the personality to effectively post office and almost six out of 10 inde@@ pen@@ dents that his temper@@ ament does not go to the White House , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ally vot@@ er acc@@ ust@@ om to the idea .
if they dis@@ assem@@ ble their scholar@@ ship , Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked to win the GO@@ P &apos;s nomin@@ ation , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump be the best bet .
that &apos;s a change since the time when four of July started their money at Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation only 28 % for the final Candi@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ P@@ ets Tr@@ umps campaign can be viewed as plau@@ si@@ bly .
even when the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have gathered to have a different candidate , Tr@@ ump is still prov@@ oked almost everyone .
some experts point out that the frag@@ mentation field probably contributes to m@@ umps , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ user .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump have harvest@@ ed the multi@@ fac@@ eted support .
he found before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , prior to Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , Walker 15 points , before je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally at edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on race .
a tight majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half the voters declare that they have awarded her voices .
of course , a lot may happen to change this , and no one can truly say , never to change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to move to other candidates .
nonetheless , m@@ umps is the strongest competition in the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six of the ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with cl@@ ump in immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was elected two months ago from Mexico &quot; rape &quot; was the immigration turning point in the public dis@@ course .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans will stop away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re @-@ orientation endeav@@ our .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday say six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans that they do with cl@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the spot@@ light , the Donald Tr@@ ump will seem to do so .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now falls about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ ag pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are also angry in Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa stated two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; h@@ √∂ll@@ isch . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive living in Germany
this is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att area .
in the street the square is a square meter of a prec@@ in@@ ct apartment of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt is the offering to objects is limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special wearing a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany top @-@ Woh@@ er comes one of the price but as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Fi@@ ker has released a ranking of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square met@@ er@@ ers in swe@@ ating heights .
there are several ten thousand Euros nix - per square meter , well @-@ marked .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream@@ start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
&quot; &quot; &quot; doubt scor@@ er in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller simply has its course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a happ@@ ier match by Thomas M√ºller eb@@ ra@@ ining the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 on Olympi@@ ak@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sovereig@@ n pre@@ l@@ ude of the Champions League league .
the World Champion Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze got to book the FC Bayern at the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pir@@ ew a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their pre@@ l@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek Rek@@ ord@@ master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºl@@ lers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and G√∂@@ tz@@ es . ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th Star@@ ter@@ success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28th , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to finally fetch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t in Munich .
M√ºller received on his 28th in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s guidance of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ que Roberto , who left as a f@@ lange in the shot of the world master .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had Bayern Kap@@ it√§@@ n Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis Stadium in front of 3@@ 1,6@@ 88 hot @-@ flowers fans - and the Munich acc@@ ord .
they showed a focused and eng@@ aging performance without shine .
Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the Royal class , including against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l√©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 stol@@ per@@ te here also Bor@@ ussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ du@@ els , with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bra@@ ve , with their obvious efforts , but often too inf@@ eri@@ ess to works .
the attacks was reported too often per player dro@@ pping at the left of Douglas Costa , which was rarely en@@ ched against the former Br@@ uns@@ wick Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ella@@ ab@@ i .
M√ºller had no luck from the right , than his flan@@ k made out of the right mid @-@ field in the left top left @-@ field .
at the 6@@ 7 minute the world master gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ St√ºr@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown was struck by the ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by director , the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee par@@ ated ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bavaria had stopped their usual game , Piraeus was able to put them off .
on Tor@@ be@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was abandoned .
as about as he had a shot of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 06 ) .
against Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola laid a four @-@ cat with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario G√∂t@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back at the cad@@ re , sat initially outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was first given after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ vor@@ ast Matthias S@@ ammer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something else of it is quite mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him as he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an to the prosec@@ uted Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 09 ) .
Got@@ h@@ dad came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6 ) and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , by El@@ f@@ ade , M√ºller still got up .
before the game it was at the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ al .
after a smaller group of partly cur@@ ved Bayern @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block obviously had prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Pir@@ re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , attacked the security forces and went with head@@ pieces against the M√ºn@@ chner trailer .
at least one Bayern fan was transported to the stadium .
anyone smok@@ ed , has a higher risk , teeth to lose
who smok@@ ed , not only does the lungs , but also the teeth , and that places a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : in ver@@ zi@@ cht the risk is fast .
smok@@ ers have a clearly higher risk to losing their teeth early .
this is out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutr@@ ition@@ Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ sm@@ oker , in smok@@ ers the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , around the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had been watching more than 23,@@ 300 entran@@ ts .
root causes for dental loss of tooth dec@@ ay and inflammation of the tooth car@@ n@@ al , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and g@@ ills therefore goes back to the most common br@@ ittle gi@@ vers in smok@@ ers .
not clear , however , smoking also increases the risk for tooth dec@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped working with smoking , but they could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it can take over ten years until the endangering returned to the level of non @-@ smoking , first author Thomas Diet@@ rich of the English university of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it makes people persu@@ aded not to be non @-@ smok@@ ers , explained the study conductor H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ F@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not too smoke is good for lung and pleas@@ ing , and leads to our findings also to a good dental health to the high age .
over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of age , the DI@@ f@@ E shared with .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental loss .

EU Commission proposes to fight the TTIP
for the dispute of the dispute over the proposed Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversi@@ al private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between concert and states should therefore be dis@@ solved by a transpar@@ ant system that clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes in its way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system whose citizens &apos; trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the responsible EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ str√∂m had shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sister in Sweden has to put the proposal as European negotiating positions in the free @-@ trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TTIP must create the largest free @-@ trade zone in the world with 800 million people .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ √ºt with the question of the Prime Minister
since its election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Deb@@ √ºt has been asking for the pre@@ valence of the Prime Minister with excitement .
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut in the question of the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to raise the first of its six prescribed questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be checked out of the media and the Labour MPs .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave his colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as she is coming to his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett and his speech at the Tu@@ c Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Party decision @-@ chairman , held on Tuesday during the day of the day to commemor@@ ate the 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the center of multiple Tit@@ le times in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n decision , not to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne has drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respec@@ table st@@ illness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he did the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of Royal Air Force in the Luft@@ schl@@ acht um England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told on the BBC Two News@@ night program , he got the Labour chairman to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; independently of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have expressed themselves to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s peak team , and they are called to dis@@ agreements with the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary party was originally supported as leaders .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also st@@ acks in Labour to follow Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements to the European Union and the limit for winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the Tu@@ c Conference that Labour to change the whole idea of limiting a whole .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of work and pensions , that the party &quot; very clear &quot; is that it was only opposed to the government plans to lower the limit of 26,@@ 000 ¬£ to 23,@@ 000 ¬£ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the 5th Labour chair , Prime Minister David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss , in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour Chair@@ woman , who promised a different policy set , says that he has been &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the question of the Prime Minister &apos;s Prime @-@ prime minister is too front@@ ative and that it has made both &quot; perc@@ ussions &quot; and the dispute with re@@ port@@ ability and what has been made to concentrate on serious problems like poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of Economic Affairs is represented by him if he is not participating - for example , if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea to talking to other colleagues on the word , and that he said John Ber@@ co@@ w , the spokes@@ man of the basement , addressed to discuss the problem .
when he became leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron wants to move from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; who is often associated with the question of Prime Minister . but a few years later he ad@@ mits that he failed .
since she was sent first in 1990 on TV , the question was regarded with the Prime Minister as the principal Bar@@ ometer of the Ur@@ haus and his position in the House of Commons and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics argue that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and have far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ unds through acceler@@ ated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound has grown spr@@ ung@@ arly after data , which show an increase in the rise of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the B@@ ond goal SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the result grew without bonuses in the UK by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the fastest and er@@ led ass@@ essm@@ ents at the time of a interest increase .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and has been climb@@ ed up to 2.@@ 47@@ % compared to the euro on 1,@@ 37@@ 30 ‚Ç¨ .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 49 % on 6.@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the R@@ ival AB In@@ Be@@ v was made .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and are brands like Bud@@ ƒõ@@ jo@@ ys , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
du@@ berry shares were according to the latest news from the competition match for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts The latest sales figures mean all expectations and also demonstrated that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ ks - again growth .
shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore dropped by 5 % after the mining industry claimed that it had been lower 2.5 billion $ by a share in its share of debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the biggest los@@ ers in the index , and with a drop by 4.3 % after the Sach@@ man Sach@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had set his estimate for the company ratings for &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more buying power in the po@@ ckets of the potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchase power would be the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the cost could meet the Expan@@ sion@@ sp@@ l√§n@@ e of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato &quot; instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; on a poster of PEG@@ ID@@ A @-@ movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a spi@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster with a PEG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the wording &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his shop turns a barbecue that is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multi @-@ cul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; Al@@ h@@ ay says .
the idea of the Leb@@ anese in Munich can now enter the office in Munich .
in this period , it has recently protected the authority of the authority as a second @-@ hand computer .
how much meat and how much potatoes of sp@@ ie@@ √ü contains , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y it .
only so much : &quot; it tastes together even better , &quot; he finds .

Met@@ cash will launch Fore@@ word campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - di@@ arr@@ he@@ a
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the Ig@@ A stores in front of a Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early year , strengthen the cash and Ig@@ A supermarkets with local food suppliers and build the brand BLA@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing over social media , as well as Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
Ig@@ A @-@ distributors and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer Simm@@ ons from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ stores and shop@@ ke@@ owners , who installed tickets for the South Australian soccer liga to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices continues its annual investors Strateg@@ ic Day .
there is much stake in the game , since South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ Lad@@ en@@ forced ju@@ ices and more profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the East States will generate .
in South Australia and Western Australia , not@@ or@@ ally provincial and Ig@@ A retailers have much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
however , analy@@ st like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will be away and all available players , but mainly independently retailers are taken away .
one this week released , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A retail@@ er 360 $ million revenue per year and Met@@ cash will lose 250 millions $ by the end of 2016 .
this pre@@ diction is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generates sales of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and groc@@ eries and in the quantities of a high @-@ cast high fix@@ ture might cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in East states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A bun@@ ker are the most advanced .
Morgan Stan@@ ley demonstrates that Met@@ cas@@ hes turnover in food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , about 4.6 percent in 2017 and 2,@@ 1 percent in 2018 , will be reduced by 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fond@@ ation managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a post office in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash war@@ n it to respond publicly to the comments from Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a pre @-@ member of Met@@ cash has received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
I@@ GA@@ s market share has declined since 2010 by 18 percent to 14 per cent , and dispos@@ es of Met@@ cas@@ hs of food and groc@@ er , which has been supplied by approximately 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailers , has been established by 43 percent since 2012 , reflec@@ ting the operating debt reduction in compar@@ ing pressure on revenues and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ aler cry however and invest@@ s more than 150 million $ , in order to deliver sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ ites at hundreds of products every week and delivering a better choice to improve their stores by growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ hs main managing director Ian Hol@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tion and loading @-@ san@@ itation programs will gain and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return in 2017 for the first time in four years to a profit growth .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves a view of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ k@@ akis , the younger Du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was carried out again as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; with the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying show in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was soon to be separated by the refer@@ ee , whereby Har@@ rison was called : &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka would have to strike Kyr@@ gios , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis rac@@ tors , after a cl@@ ashed one potential US @-@ Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet has been ver@@ kl@@ ed , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , compete with Sam , at the second place in the Ein@@ zel behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup , semi@@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing , about which I am quite stra@@ wberry , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was brought up a little in the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he has broken a r@@ acket in US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken up a bat from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he really beha@@ ved in the US Open extremely well , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he worked very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never worked with the other players , he is well trained , he is fine in shape , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own earnings .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into account with the important prere@@ quis@@ ites which begins on Friday and he describes the &apos; shared decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he as@@ sures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fix@@ ture of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we wish that the team is entirely focused on the competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kyr@@ gios &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick was very quickly pointed to the rise of what he pointed out of how fe@@ ather and Mur@@ ray . he goes down in the eyes of the public , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the struggle , that he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ ici@@ an , closes the border , holding refugees back
Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and left the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all of those who tried to come back illegal in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed by the border , when hundreds of migrants settled in a m@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ bian officials with rebel@@ lion .
the people who had escap@@ ed from violence used for an unknown period of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and er@@ built tents , and settled down there .
but fru@@ stration wins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helic@@ opter about them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ ens the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ ens the borders ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sch@@ rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ y@@ makers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were made up of protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia declared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be sent from Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ision damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be discussions in Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tur@@ bul@@ enzen an der ung@@ ar@@ isch @-@ Ser@@ b border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a meeting in Brussels could not arrange joint immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were quot@@ ed in over@@ tax@@ ed Italy and Greece . they strongly expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year - a deal would be agreed that the EU states would take another 1@@ 20,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary , however , made his hopes not to return to an immediate action of Brussels or its neighbours .
the Emer@@ gency shelter in two southern regions gave authority more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could not accelerate streets and asylum .
the Hungarian Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also stops the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the land - after ending a fence along the Ser@@ bian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison @-@ races drew near the competition , go@@ os@@ u@@ cks fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant disaster for many war@@ nings from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a substantial Eng@@ ins and the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most in@@ coming economic migrants are seeking a better life , and not war @-@ wing popul@@ ate - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that occurred at midnight in Hungary , make crossing of border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence along the border to Serbia on the southern border to Serbia , for a crime . these laws are also laying higher r@@ t@@ abo@@ ons for the human trafficking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation caused by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament has to agree with the use of the military as yet to the use of the military that is expected for next week but re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press have already pushed back at the border to armed forces with vehicles and dogs already days .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , State @-@ security advis@@ ors to Or@@ ban , said that today , there are 45 people trying to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come down by destro@@ ying the fence , they are now in police force and will be accused of the acts of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities have to fix the fence fast .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border trans@@ itions with Serbia , after a pull @-@ wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the borders , arrived .
chaos conver@@ ged the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal containers to edit the data from people and op@@ pressing a human amount to get there .
about 20 managed to interv@@ ene , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants were the most important highway alliance between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse the food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton &apos;s prot@@ ru@@ sion in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton is continuing to hold a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race for nomin@@ ation at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins its opposite ground .
Clinton has now reached the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet been announced , whether he can run for the President &apos;s Office , receive support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinions are determining what candidates must support them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ ton Sup@@ por@@ ters are qualified in their choices than that of other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while others achieved some gain .
Clinton is holding a big rise in women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have reduced .
your support among the men is decreased clearly , and S@@ anders does not lie just with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years are ev@@ apor@@ ates , and they are now at the same level .
Clinton had a great lead in the older voters .
last month , Clinton had been with double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders does have a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the elections pro@@ ud@@ ly say they would support the Clinton Hill if she would have been nominated by the Party .
a quarter would help it with some advantages and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate status .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , that Clin@@ t &apos;s active suppor@@ ter were especially delighted with her .
the views are stronger with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - just about a quarter it would strongly support them .
while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections suggest that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less republi@@ can voters about their nickname and Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 % ) .
when Clin@@ ics supporters in an open question should be asked why they want the candidates that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman will be president ( 13 percent ) and that they will become the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
von Clin@@ ton Sup@@ ports are also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ tor@@ ability are also quot@@ ed .
since the Vice President re@@ jects a potential for the President &apos;s Office , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third thinks he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked by the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den at the top .
von Clin@@ ton trailers is saying more than half the fact that Bi@@ den would be far ahead of legend .
decides to limit the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats not to nomin@@ ate the nomin@@ ation of democr@@ ats , the Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s fore@@ front in front of S@@ anders , of 20 points with be@@ ating in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
twenty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate to win the election ; however , this figure is down from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage being nam@@ ing it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selected &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters have questions about the elec@@ tor@@ ability .
similar to the last month there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics on voters of the election of their party .
maj@@ orities are demonstr@@ ating Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ des as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong management qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts with the three candidates most at honest@@ y , while Clin@@ tons strength is the guide .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not share it with him .
democratic voters of the elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all of these measurements , some quarter of the democratic elec@@ tor@@ ate did not agree with anything else .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ f can be asked for a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an Secretary of Secretary , most Democratic voters are happy with their declaration regarding the matter and say that their opinions do not affect a total .
but it is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are now disp@@ le@@ ased with their declaration while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem of light came , split .
most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
there are mainly rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 , say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as being genuine and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month , and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them to a honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of those entitled to vote are far even more straightforward and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will receive good notes at the guide .
cut out at the six tested candidates by Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush on the best at honest@@ y .
a majority regards us rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many do not have an opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 NA@@ P@@ ick in the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son re@@ moves to the past Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is present in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times and Donald Tr@@ ump
the two Candi@@ dates dis@@ counted by half the support of the voters in the new pol@@ l , and others will lose more dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support tracks in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sch@@ oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son meets demo@@ graphic groups well received and carrying Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ ze , is struck with Wis@@ cons@@ in govern@@ or Scott Walker , who died on the deep@@ est part of 10 % in the last month .
the former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % in the third place .
the bu@@ ck at the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the recent CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that car@@ son increases in surveys - it lan@@ det at 19 % support at the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tr@@ ump considerably from Car@@ son .
with a view over a last week rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found several si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son is ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask m@@ umps on question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during a show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five Members of Br@@ other@@ hood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student during a student ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed , M@@ ord@@ an@@ cies will be filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ other@@ hood attacks Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initial ritual in September 2013 and consumed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police shared with him .
officials spoke , he had been loaded with associated eyes with a 30 pounds back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly been attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ other@@ hood does not toler@@ ate the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and wa@@ ited an hour before they brought it to a hospital so the police .
but you had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Br@@ other@@ hood , to give advice , said Pol@@ ishing Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide Ut@@ ensi@@ lien and posed the well @-@ being of the Br@@ other@@ hood , basically above the by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ pot@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning of his wo@@ unds .
after an au@@ top@@ ical , Den@@ g repeated with mu@@ te force injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Sch@@ ik@@ anen of Br@@ other@@ hood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year to the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in a statement .
Br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an acc@@ us@@ ation due to the murder of the third Gr@@ ades for the first five members .
two @-@ und@@ n@@ age members of Br@@ other@@ hood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for chi@@ ev@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to assume the people involved , but if there is an organisation that has - officially or officially - this sanc@@ tioned to account , so we will also call them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Br@@ other@@ hood , and the national br@@ other@@ hood led its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a fork height comes , and the hous@@ ings will fall into the banks to rise up and the economy will lead to a recession .
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guide to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted to 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising of interest rates is often , though not always , a factor by how the economy and the financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US bank account so severe that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact several variables perform a role .
at the end of the market participants , however , note that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of a Zin@@ c cav@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; endor@@ se money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the grad@@ ual return of US interest to normal heights , but still to a low level in order to lead to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to be afraid .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here , a view to historical trends are based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the decrease of Zin@@ ser@@ mining things can pour things for a while .
once the increase in , the influence is not so dramatically .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth proceeds 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank anal@@ ysts in a newer study on what happens to Zin@@ ser@@ gens of the F@@ ed .
specifically , the market in the past 35 years mostly in heating - about 14 per cent - on the way to the Zin@@ Ser@@ vat@@ ure , fairly flat in the last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 per cent according to a current analysis , the Bob Doll , leader facility at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equ@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear later in the increases cycle , and returns the return to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic survival , but Zin@@ ser@@ mining are often promoting them .
in the current case , F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that had not existed before and they could accelerate a recession .
extremely remarkable is here that the brood @-@ domestic product is near its lowest point near its lowest point at a fork @-@ height of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 Zin@@ ser@@ gens have been located since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP is less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 rose by 3.7 per cent , only few that will last , and expect the third quarter to receive information from Atlanta F@@ ed just 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fork @-@ ups in such frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made the whole year for a fork @-@ up of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee on this week which ends on Thursday .
while many str@@ ati@@ egen and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increases sexual cycles from 1950 to date in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP has taken place and on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ essi@@ on@@ sh@@ √∂h@@ en very quickly put forward after the start of recovery in the shadow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the ob@@ serving phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been awaiting the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has so far been 74 months .
the firm income was also vol@@ at@@ ile , since the market is a Zin@@ c cav@@ ity , and the pattern is quite similar in the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect at bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
at bonds appear to change the direction once the first increase / reduction in the cycle is done .
at the end of the increases cycle , the bond rating fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the stra@@ ining of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to the yield between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a stop@@ over of the curve .
high @-@ delay bonds often bring better results in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Anal@@ yst@@ ine in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting is , thinks that the markets already have adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates are asc@@ ending , the bearing type is fl@@ atter , l@@ ten@@ se have extended and the vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed exac@@ erb@@ ated their strategy .
in large and globally , companies will benefit from the larger part of their business activities in the U.S. , benefit from interest rates and local products more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debts are going to be worse , because a rising dollars will make their products on the global market more expensive and the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares there tend to react very positively to three months after an initial dis@@ solution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with f@@ aking balance in accordance with each of the Zin@@ ser@@ mining companies in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yield as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also over@@ step@@ ped up their counter@@ parts with low quality by average 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debts will become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most losing , said Gold@@ man .
consumers outside the pure share of stock will also benefit from the rising dollars .
as@@ parag@@ us could see gains due to higher y@@ ields , even if experts are of different opinion , how quickly that will happen .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says speaker of Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament crit@@ ici@@ zed the radio station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; verse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not too different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also addressed the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ pris@@ oned The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; parliamentary colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins got the show The Voice and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turned up &quot; to Classic FM , claim@@ ing a leader and increases new pressure on the station , to prove that he does something for the private sender doesn &apos;t do .
the Con@@ servative Euro Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender , sil@@ ly , and increasingly no longer be distinguished by its commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to become Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also addressed the BBC Music Awards held in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , The Br@@ its seems to be just under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate anything that is already on the market , &quot; says Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General @-@ Director@@ ate dism@@ issed the acc@@ us@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to live music and enligh@@ tenment .
what I learned from Radio 3 I am nowhere to learn about classical music anywhere .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to give the engagement of Radio 3 , to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I get too important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey that tough@@ er to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was however , not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media , and sport conducted under fire to step the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the musical talent performance show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for valued cost of 22 million ¬£ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it isn &apos;t original and not distinctive ?
Lord Hall has insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; in a special BBC manner . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in @-@ house animal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it refused to ex@@ clude the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or ex@@ clude money of the animation for other sub @-@ behavior formats .
Internet revenue grew in August on the slow and Black Friday may be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
the last month has been the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using phones to shop
experts believe that Black Friday has stopped making issues in November
for over a decade the virtual entry has been cur@@ ved , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into spirit @-@ cities .
yet experts say that there are signs now that the online turnover was st@@ agn@@ ant , after opening up new numbers only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales st@@ agn@@ ant after new numbers showed up only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ sales decline of the Guardian .
he stated that online sales has increased three years ago , as buyer began to make purchases with their phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it is comm@@ uted one , and we will possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold their bought purchases in this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computers , to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites cr@@ ashed away .
experts believe that Black Friday at which the buyer could meet for bar@@ gain , buyers of them could hold shopping .
a study of the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that off 5 pounds spending a slightly more than 1 ¬£ online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases can now be done through Web @-@ shops .
at the same time is purchases more than a quarter of the people clothing and shoes online , rather than in the mo@@ on@@ ks in the cities .

an Arab version of the decre@@ e , published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the B@@ in @-@ Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news paper published this detail but did not say that the leadership of the company is going to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised that the overthrow of the crane caused , that rus@@ hed to a courtyard of the Grand@@ ma , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which is taking place later this month .

if you are sent with a hammer or a brush to deal with walls , these days they seem to be a minority .
because they increasingly employ cra@@ fts@@ men to carry out do @-@ it jobs in their homes , making the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V√©ronique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her who has the buil@@ ders chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled trad@@ es@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services on low prices have now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which address the art@@ isan and 60 selling points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ shops because eight of ten decisions are taken in the store by women .
the moment is ab@@ id@@ ing with the employees the men .
it said that it is necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move this stronger towards a balance .
in principle , half of our customers benef@@ ited from women with 80 percent of the choices on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also under@@ gone the top team to reflect the same number of men and women in management positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies almost 50 percent of the team with women , including management and finance .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Super@@ vis@@ ory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her burned a decline in the half @-@ year financial and the transform@@ ers , after the group op@@ ed the cost of the closing of the stores .
King@@ fis@@ her because of the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will have 200 new branches .
functional of A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian vol@@ leyball ch@@ ance , A@@ ich / DO@@ B must be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and waste education .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with regard to ministers .
in this acc@@ us@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted in May of legal proceedings .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in preliminary studies that the accused in the years 2006 to 2011 were mon@@ ies of uni@@ onists used by them in their functions disp@@ at@@ ched for private purposes .
the damage was more than 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sporting events are also charged for finance .
this faculty is the Chairman of the Sch@@ open@@ en@@ sen@@ ats , Jud@@ ge Michaela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
to the acc@@ us@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represents that the association has not yet been a asset .
the sporting tools have only calculated counter@@ acc@@ us@@ ations and the sports club , for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money from the debts of debts - the passi@@ v@@ ans bet@@ ru@@ gen in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then , we were standing in front of the situation : do we keep the club on or block us ? , &quot; he told one of the accused , in the bread @-@ com@@ mander of the financial officer .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to undertake this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have received money to go our life insurance as safety in the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the im@@ bur@@ sement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Association has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money free , there are only no debts .
furthermore , in case of dis@@ proportion@@ ate financial success the payout of the ship@@ ments agreed to 1991 has been agreed .
therefore , one part of the compens@@ ations for only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus in the account has been paid .
therefore , l@@ ump @-@ works and not details @-@ sle@@ eves are explained , explained the former ob@@ mann &apos;s operations .
the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us managed by the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant .
why the withdrawal of the club were not described in detail , asked the Jud@@ ge .
the society was not interested in detail for the Finance of Finance , be important only to debt freedom , the answer .
when in 2011 against the one functional investigation for counter@@ parts began , an amount of ‚Ç¨ 1@@ 20,000 Euros was transferred to the account account .
the account has been , explained the def@@ endants .
that transl@@ ator went out to the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to their statement to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted the Jud@@ ge know .
I did not know that she asked for a long time .
then he said , he believed that this was the best for the society .
if something had happened , nobody would have known some of this money , placed the prosec@@ ut@@ or in the room .
the fellow did not have been informed , right the ten@@ ant .
this transfer has been formulated as &quot; claims . &quot;
why does damage ? , wanted to know Jud@@ ge and the prosec@@ ut@@ or .
the first def@@ endant , he did not agree with this formulation , because the association did not have any damage done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the attorney says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; law representative &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the functional he did not purchase a cent sal@@ ary , he applied only od@@ ometer and di@@ ets .
in di@@ ets , he dealt with the Club 1,000 Euro a month , but the actual effort was however much higher , he added .
exact documentation for the early years could not be as@@ serted .
these are after a work@@ test , where everything has been judged properly , no longer has been kept , explained them .
od@@ ometer @-@ money also had the second def@@ endant related .
all claims are made in cash , as soon as he must drive from his residence international market to the Bank of Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
the main proceedings will continue on September 23 with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US not@@ aries
the world has been observed if the U.S. not@@ aries arrived on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are lifted or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists were question@@ ed by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will har@@ den a little longer and the interest rates will keep on the current state of 0 - 0,25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been 7 years since the F@@ ed interest has been N@@ ULL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a major central bank may start the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is based on a relatively good performance level , tr@@ illion dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed does not ignore the less liquid view to global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 hours ME@@ Z on Thursday
deaths on the Delta State University lag@@ ier@@ ed for re@@ training
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before coming to his colleagues on the day , he wrote a note to say that he would be &quot; sorry &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it un@@ attended , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , Do@@ zent for Ge@@ ography and socio @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number on Monday morning .
and he said , he was shot on someone and someone killed .
Lamb said to the staff of the recall that police officers must send the police to his home .
he said , &quot; I sh@@ ouse my wife yesterday evening , and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house is , but &quot; no man will distur@@ b &apos; , but probably be excited .
the police demanded the ru@@ fer to his name , but he did not exist .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police came the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I just wanted to do it too .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note of 300 miles to Delta State University , where he joined A@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , mort@@ als , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as police officers him hu@@ st@@ ained .
Universal President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he know nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs imagination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday that he supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trinity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss was born by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that she was about seven years married as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced before 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , He and Pr@@ ent@@ iss have had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss were their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss worked online from home , following statement by Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who poss@@ essed a dog named Light@@ ning , who met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that I called relative to a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as polic@@ emen ask him at the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night he ran his car to the side , flew away in the woods and k@@ ick@@ ed herself with a shot .
Lamb received a Doc@@ tor@@ ate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University in spring 2015 like his life lau can be found at the University &apos;s website .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play Lan@@ yards from Manchester United continent
Luke Sha@@ w , suffered by the Champions League of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , a double carrier of his right leg .
while this def@@ enders the left external def@@ enders was brought to cr@@ ying and ex@@ clude it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope not that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H√©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was sear@@ ched in the PS@@ V Area .
he was treated in nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before going to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double but@@ t@@ cture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will leave tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then in Manchester .
it is horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United is , it has very difficult and then it takes place .
in the locker room he had a oxygen mas@@ ks .
he cri@@ ed .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have double but@@ tering , then the six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of an elli@@ pse .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ alize the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had cor@@ rupted .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very hard attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws Account : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I will come back stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this relates to : Manchester United will incur@@ red the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at the PS@@ V
the British Defender has an additional incentive in France to recover at the European Championship .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very worst injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury the place , all are very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno followed a sur@@ ge , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als The Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you listen to it that there is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not possible for me to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving into another direction , leaving it out , as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very badly with it . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a matter which all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book will not last long before you know it almost entirely .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child @-@ play was decided , the Prime Minister chose The Lor@@ en@@ au , the 1971 @-@ born environmental label of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , he writes Cameron in a message on the company &apos;s Super@@ b , and continues : &quot; funny , mot@@ if@@ ying , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to have always been a picture or a message which we have so far missed . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to re@@ produce the action of the book , instead re@@ produces a ingredient of the movie version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to extend the rather short original text .
in the middle of the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , the girl of Audre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , met his desire to see a genuine tree , his exact name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss ho@@ oked and the 1991 passed , but completely unknown .
as if that was not suspic@@ i@@ ously enough it would be presented in part such as the abstract of the Lor@@ en@@ film film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Datab@@ ase , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes to gain a boy named Ted , the heart of Audre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he as@@ su@@ ed to be a prag@@ mat@@ ism father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the action of the book so little familiar . here &apos;s an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the bo@@ died , trees fal@@ lo@@ ping , sn@@ ails , sn@@ ail @-@ shar@@ pen@@ ed beings , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR mission became deleg@@ ated to a volunteer , who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a child .
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably come by Cameron &apos;s vote office .
furthermore , Super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Cameron staff was delivered , but did not have any further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England , but it is still difficult
to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you chose the Ka@@ der , which England has chosen for the tour , there is a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series @-@ defeat not on my card .
I would not get a down@@ ward win .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there &apos;s a good spin @-@ player in the Batt@@ ing area , and the community is strong ; they will not wear nar@@ rows of 2012 only a ju@@ ly @-@ positive attitude .
the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as a spin Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size to test level , is an option for the attack .
this in @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th moves from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision of letting Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , was difficult to analyse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ ck@@ ers are aimed at results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no question mark at Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and this led to nomin@@ ation because - and I said this - players have chosen their own best selection .
a long time ago he would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
so when he will hopefully lead further le@@ ps for Yor@@ k@@ shire , comes another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not put such good performances , and that struck me not : he is above all a team man .
the question as a lot of time will get a test head@@ mann to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and down@@ wards .
the only acc@@ us@@ ation that one can rise , was that England first replaced Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in peak - but this lost chance is now in the past .
alex Hal@@ es comes in and he is a stroke that I sets high up .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ mp @-@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he sco@@ red 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which was very basic to us .
it must be at least the same chances as that before him , but this depends naturally by the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to let Mo@@ een comes next to C@@ ook , which would bring an extra spin @-@ off bowl and will receive four j@@ icks , and I have nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed have already shown that he is a devil @-@ shot of cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een may not be done his job for County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is it a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ colleague Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he step@@ ped up as Open@@ er 2001 .
he made a hundred of us immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use he has impressed me as a young man very impressed .
people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with a ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup elements which have their hands up@@ lift themselves and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
aside from the crew , England has made some wise additions to the co@@ aches .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ y , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as advis@@ er to the testing games , could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as co@@ aches , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously mess@@ enger .
Coll@@ ator &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben Stok@@ es , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Roo@@ t got a similar break against Australia and I did not have a problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ rider determine not the schedule .
and you must remember that such as players will depend on their jobs .
such decisions will not be taken in easy heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bre@@ xit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ xit = exp@@ ire Britain from the EU ) could gain momentum when the economy was converted into a fleet in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ aired new L@@ oss strategy to keep Britain in the EU , will be lifted out in trouble with each day , even without the choice of in@@ geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour or the Tu@@ c , which viol@@ ently viol@@ ently for Europe on Tuesday .

a European diplom@@ at and said today that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always from its own gu@@ ilt , Britain itself , created an agenda with a split and distur@@ bing changes , which they mostly do not want .
in Brigh@@ ton the Tu@@ c decided on her annual general meeting that it may not matter if they thre@@ aten the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie &apos;s Agenda .
prime minister and finance minister climb@@ s at the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local dimensions , come home and say they will win their allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
my European friend , who wishes for an outside UK inside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; Make us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you look at that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted minister and officials come to the point where there is no matter whether we remain or going .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ ti@@ ously ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been on power for 10 years before it looks bad for them as it does with the exagger@@ ated long @-@ har@@ ming like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French Fran√ßois Hollande looks back on his election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ass@@ ing force .
Poland probably has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain as a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that it will be a bite to help the self @-@ bear@@ er whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even clarify some helpful comment , entirely in the SN@@ P @-@ style , whereas Great Britain &apos;s speech base in 2017 , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how r@@ ally the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU sk@@ ep@@ tics the oligar@@ chy of the Press@@ eb@@ ar@@ one is , as did not exist during the time of Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s promoted refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms 1975 , but did not support our entry to 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who has made a name for himself as a &quot; EU @-@ of ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ years .
with all his understanding , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
for this , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing @-@ Sch@@ ur@@ king , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners and P@@ seudo non @-@ countries , who own most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air felt like Tony Bl@@ air like it , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , you are better ban@@ anas distributed to di@@ stract him rather than to become his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , as he had filed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ wir@@ bel , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU who were then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who opened him a back door .
the press has never forgotten it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster , gave me a friendly l@@ aps on the back - I told him that he had no time for me to wast@@ ed boy@@ cot@@ t boy@@ cot@@ t &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t strategy of the 80 @-@ er years , an error back then and nowadays .
it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe is - i express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ are Ten@@ dency and the wild@@ ly pupp@@ ets of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably make everyone to say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on television this week said , did not deny that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ ers years , when his old father took an effort to strike an effort to loyal to his Labour cabinet , without losing too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and Members according to all reports on their cl@@ ause on Monday night .
whatever the tou@@ ching bottom line of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ cture of Social Media , a brood @-@ care of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is true that Cameron does not give a free map for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ our@@ y support in the fil@@ ly campaign for a matter of course such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell es said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think for sure .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental resource activities - in accordance with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ er@@ ungs @-@ economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left @-@ presi@@ dents , for which the scar@@ city will be a key principle of dog@@ matic dispute .
like with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to re@@ sign@@ ation - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin apply political capital - they have also mis@@ leading voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when this can be meaning@@ less ?
the United States are already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government to power , which I was reminded of something when the British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum is called .
experts critic@@ ising the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , told researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined , by sending the voc@@ ations used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he released the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grund@@ stimmung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have question@@ ed the power of the data and directed to the connections between several experts and the tobacco industry .
an article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y base &quot; on the p@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers are in BM@@ J and have asked whether to establish the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public expected that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of retro@@ spec@@ tion and mod@@ elling .
indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were appointed to develop a model for multi @-@ user criteria ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to perform their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine hal@@ ist products to produce ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he must have received after reports before the Tab@@ ak@@ firm Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of members of the board will not be delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes Champions , some of which also specify a branches of industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting they took part in the tobacco leadership .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ lows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations in the p@@ he report is discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ he said that &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes had been a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smok@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of health and well @-@ being at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that you have responded to the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smok@@ ers dies in its ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes can be low compared to that , but we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the unique obligation to inform the public about what evidence is given and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die each year in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion ¬£ a year .
thanks to the clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give to East@@ En@@ ders , head former Chief of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that will not be sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he crit@@ ici@@ zed the BBC for making it public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , covering the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ans like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , said Johnson , that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which were also clearly revealed by not subsidi@@ zing ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communic@@ ations Committee within its investigation about the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broad@@ casting fee , which I do not use mid or long term for a good idea , one should do its production at least on programs that do not do or give your production .
you send The Voice in a first class window , because they want to achieve maximum support for their future as possible .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a rainy tax schemes that could be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both Self @-@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give her right arm to it .
I be@@ ef@@ ull me to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would ever reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for reviews , &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC pass this again , what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart @-@ presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal limb@@ s should go to BB@@ C4 , but they are going to do rather the audience , and they can argue when they perform on their seem@@ ing missions to justi@@ fication of 4 billion ¬£ Rund@@ funk@@ tions , &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all of these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window in which no one wants to see them ever .
to the Rund@@ funk@@ Fee , Johnson said the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value .
of course , we all think we think that you get a great value for 150 ¬£ a year here , but for guys who is for the 150 ¬£ a lot of money , ask me if that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chef David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , urged that the BBC also check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educate and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be addressed to public @-@ legal broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , and let this change in &quot; inform and enter@@ tain them . &quot;
the question of partner@@ ing said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television was shown , and with the commercial Sen@@ ator alli@@ ances , to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ as@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ at@@ des are changing the direction in the moment in which it is shining with Klang@@ impul@@ ses .
scientists have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nerv@@ ousness , which can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves .
tiny Nem@@ at@@ periods change the direction in the moment that they have with Klang@@ impul@@ ses to have heard for the human hearing on high frequencies so as to be listened .
the impul@@ ses are working through the inser@@ tion of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels that respond to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und channels .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers led the wor@@ ms pointed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ og@@ etics in which ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La Jol@@ la , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure , the electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
li@@ ke@@ yp@@ ad normally do not react to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani marked that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und effect effect on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ ary channels and found in the membrane cells from some of the thro@@ ws .
the sound waves make an opening of these I@@ on@@ form@@ ations and activate the cells that they are al@@ located to such a report to Nature Communications .
to create ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und periods , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ ions contribute TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
when he turns ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und into the creatures of the creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied through the micro@@ bes and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ ions on the creatures .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a pione@@ ering tool , which enables scientists to absor@@ b neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and turn it off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ as@@ etics could have some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light , that has to be sent to an optical fiber on the desired job in the brain , low @-@ frequency ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und tissue may be extended and thus can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily to make the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith of bur@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have up@@ set - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting discomfort over others .
most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed into eight simple rules .
the move in Stud@@ enten@@ inhab@@ it ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to swe@@ ating : people will tell you from where you come to know if and where you have Sab@@ bat@@ on , where you don &apos;t love to love him or hate , because in the Ernst , guys , there is only a yeast extracts h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - places you questions and show interest .
it len@@ ght the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were based in fire and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
leave people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film @-@ night event venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people prefer to tigh@@ ten and wear their under@@ wear .
in this point , do not remember to begin with a relationship at the university .
Int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refu@@ ge , yet many student dormit@@ ories form a room @-@ to @-@ room b@@ um@@ mel culture that can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for anyone trying to relax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship goes on , but you have to go away so I can get the energy back for inter@@ acting with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a comm@@ hil@@ ator of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted and send it an SMS instead to kno@@ ck .
A@@ prop@@ os ank@@ lo@@ p : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through b@@ aking .
as you begin the university at the height of the back Man@@ ie , the Klo@@ pping is to imagine the doors of people to imagine with a T@@ eller full of Brow@@ nies , less strange as the welcome from the 1950 &apos;s years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood I have something to b@@ aking you . so , and now please smile , if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade delicious treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and will end your face with a delicious surprise .
of course it depends on whether you are a constant b@@ aker .
bad mixed l@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat cause to make people sle@@ ep@@ y if you sli@@ ps .
food to ste@@ al is a two @-@ course crime in student dormit@@ ories .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chickens is a theft , but is it to take a drop of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the dairy farm .
the chances are good that they say to even serve themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if someone is missing your bel@@ ong@@ ings , the annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as well as my ro@@ omm@@ ate , added to their milk a so@@ ap to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
it is now in prison .
they should not make noise that the people hold from sleep or of labor .
it &apos;s not only about being a constant man , but that you are in the true sense of the rich@@ ness to the people sitting in the glass building .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something out , Drum &amp; bass cle@@ f something qui@@ eter because it had three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to that with even more striking music .
when they eventually paid at 5 am , she sent her neighbours to sleep two hours before they pl@@ agu@@ ed her own music , shut her door and ended up her three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic when your future spouse would happen to happen to the same student dormit@@ ory ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be very deeply embarrass@@ ed if you keep a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future couple , get sick , separate and then see each day and perhaps mit@@ ig@@ ate how they bring all common friends to yourself ?
of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to talk about your sub@@ dog a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that somebody has left its keys in his un@@ spo@@ ilt room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is f@@ law@@ less than it seems .
a good argument is fun , but it only takes moments , until he becomes a stroll .
grant them by plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never miss anyone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
shut off your door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in free@@ zer - but t@@ amper your poss@@ essions on the ceiling at no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , Ger@@ tru@@ conden@@ ses
the real estate contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the medium @-@ Frank@@ ish town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there are about refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need , but also the educ@@ ating mother and the righteous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to make a cheap and well @-@ established today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview
thousands of refugees will be har@@ med in the residential market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project town@@ houses for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will be har@@ med upon the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or turn@@ ery has no sustainability .
because people remain a great part here .
in the light of the refugee current , we need plenty of living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ day family @-@ service is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a ring @-@ house needs least a few place .
it makes integration .
that is different when people are in living blocks .
each of the six houses , which are being built just in the pilot project , consists of three units of housing for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be modified according to their needs .
how much are the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house off@@ rises on 184 000 euro , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months has the building took place .
this is appropriate .
have the Construction rules their plans have complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : building my project correctly carried out my project correctly .
particularly complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ worth special structure and the actu@@ ator order .
grey .
it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated who creates three apartments in a riding house will need at least three plots .
only in the cities is there the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their Sem@@ i @-@ home project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who cast in me to create luxury for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the bank@@ note about paid apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : it is true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but built in luxury apartments which hardly can afford any more .

* iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allgemein &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some are pushed for the installation to problems as they get an error , the latter cures that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to avoid the issue , users are advised to wait to wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean sol@@ ete of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier for the update of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to delete it if you delete a special tool , delete apps and then install them again as soon as the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth to make sure your mobile phone is up@@ loaded while updating or having a charger it is so that the battery is loaded .
when the load is too low , Apple does not make sure that the update will be continued , as the phone may possibly un@@ fold in half way and result it to a break@@ age of the update .

Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take on the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on the left side .
above all , Sam@@ t@@ usses Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists Uta S@@ eim @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fer Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country , doctors are missing - As@@ endorf on the other hand : there will be Dr. Frank M√ºller on 1st October the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on the 1st of October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ se@@ ausen comes at retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing by a half way to his successor in the next few months .
after a uph@@ e@@ phase , M√ºller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 310@@ 000 euros to the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us stra√üe 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance , when the Fel@@ lowship with Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met who currently took their professional education at the dener hospital and get into practice as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ se@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was as far as I was going to ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Couple M√ºller ar@@ isen the idea of operating in As@@ endorf the own practice in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old M√ºller .
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage it is also visible , soon to be his own boss .
and so one was agreed that the gar@@ bage bought the house with practice .
stay they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is the indisp@@ utable family father Frank M√ºller also grew up , his medical degree in Hannover , stations in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
at the moment he has been active as an upper veter@@ in@@ arian in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was ordered in 2009 for the intro@@ duc@@ tory mat@@ ologist in the district Di@@ ep@@ holz and is hon@@ orary and hon@@ orary in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness to Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting September 19th , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ se@@ ausen works as a pu@@ zz@@ ard , his wife has specialised in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the tr@@ ash , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , do not want to settle for home@@ aries .
&quot; die End@@ os@@ kop@@ ie comes therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after re@@ modeling the rooms are modern look like .
we will offer more ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und @-@ investigations as well as long @-@ term , and loading @-@ EK@@ GS , and need a talking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed .
a grant from a total of 500@@ 00 euros gets the gar@@ bage dump ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality of ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; that shows how proud and pleased we are , that the practice continues to be continued , &quot; stresses the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stress Man@@ t@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , each quarter come into the field of Fel@@ ting ausen , in the North @-@ German A@@ xis , it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another company &apos;s office .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ se@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have found , she would have gone .
who is visiting Ab@@ ler &apos;s talk and I still look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical cli@@ ppers and the cleaning lady from the fields .
with their part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf a era , after all , the physician for 30 years have been practiced there .
&quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; re@@ members Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ting ausen @-@ mun@@ ating .
a little bit of melan@@ chol@@ y feel after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will surely see yet many times , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inter@@ ni@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband comple@@ ment@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed me before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels via .
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls will also be loaded on our south @-@ border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that everyone who wants to seek a asylum application , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can , of course , can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and security of the people stand in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs a clear signals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ slo@@ ven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia er@@ ased &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia plans to continue to travel for both Austria and Germany and in circumstances also of cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this sounds like the square Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however not .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia leads to the surveillance of the border - primarily in Hungary - to intensi@@ fy .
on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled .
as the minister indicated , Slo@@ veni@@ ans wants to have its limits for refugees but not resistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments otherwise , the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees wouldn &apos;t have tried to go to Tuesday in the night hours of Tuesday , in East @-@ usa on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to exit the registration .
the Croatian police could seize them in the nearby ma@@ ths fields .
according to local media since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country gets around 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
moreover , buses from presses at the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ on@@ ese Border , which had so far been re@@ directed to the Hungarian border , in direction to Croatia , reported Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade are as@@ serted that it may be , people sp@@ elling certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want this , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report , any@@ how in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ bian border town Si@@ d arrived , in the course of the day further buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were travelling the whole night by the approximately 500 kilometres distant from the Maced@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has attributed to us , so the police said that we should come here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to go to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
therefore it could actually actually be a observer @-@ shift shift in the recent Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia to a slightly further west of the way .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country is prepared for the event of a strong au@@ stro@@ ma from refugees to prepare appropriate plans for possible fail@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for details he did not , but pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they carry strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since been a very good record in the country , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on ser@@ b@@ ical site stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ aun to remain at about 300 refugees .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media report , they would have spent the past night at the crossing of hor@@ g@@ os who leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border trans@@ itions remain completely closed from the border via Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g .
whether the remaining refugees want to continue to be found on the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Ser@@ bian interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was trying to calm early in Hor@@ g@@ os at a local pres@@ um@@ ination : he ret@@ ains the debates about alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not at present not be a very high refugee crisis .
one could not say if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - Alternati@@ v@@ rou@@ ten
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute refugees to refugees crossing the alternative routes via Croatia .
however , the border crossing in Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of Croatia there are still un@@ cle@@ ared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police were announced that a team of min@@ e@@ ers was sent in the border region .

in this way , the investig@@ ators were estimated to have a total of over 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in SE@@ C Communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the less view comes despite the price increases , which will be an average of 4.@@ 9 per cent and on January 4 , and despite the greater access for Bod@@ Transportation , of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said that it is nonetheless expecting the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher profits and because of growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will bring &quot; solid earnings to consider the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , mainly in manufacturing and global trade , into consideration . &quot;
plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than the ri@@ vals U@@ PS , that plant , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , about the same number as last year , stopping .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than last year .
the earnings per share will amount to US $ per share , just under the $ 2,@@ 44 per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research question@@ ed anal@@ ysts predicted .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of tick @-@ asked analy@@ st expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
Fed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international Pri@@ ority shipping in recent years , bringing sales in its unity Express @-@ shipping to a st@@ agn@@ ant .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales at Bod@@ transfer rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was mostly flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher profits due to higher prices , while the result of higher labour costs in the cargo business s@@ ank .
in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.15 % .
on Tuesday she concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent , taking a record high on 11 June .
on their most anticipated conference in the year Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni &apos;s table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the lad@@ der .
dr@@ one on them at an end of the indicated , two @-@ store@@ yed seat section is a wall of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the large recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is a minor third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate would be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to them , it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to become acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed by the unprecedented incentive due to the near to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data on the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets re@@ lie@@ ve the most cau@@ ti@@ ous fo@@ rest@@ ations , to increase these vol@@ at@@ ility , by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it also just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is first and foremost the most important thing they are observed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief econom@@ ists at the Mak@@ ler@@ store Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were searching for a pre@@ text , the interest rate does not increase , the increased uncertainty around the global market will continue to wait , and continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which as@@ sures itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , which were recently asked by Bloomberg have predicted that week canc@@ eled this week .
however , the financial markets are expecting a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ k@@ ator who only shows a 30 % chance at an increase .
this indicates a decline of the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strain of dro@@ pping will mit@@ ig@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones industrial average value at 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policies considers the set in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propos@@ itions at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she had to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that a rap@@ port would calm down the financial markets because it would in@@ hibit the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed act would be removed .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase in good ways to increase the set of 0,25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow rise of mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had in spring and in early summer , that in this year it was necessary , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down the improvement of the labour market this year was sound .
the unemployment rate s@@ ank to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
pay@@ outs have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation was permanently kept under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives had said that the main reason the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can get higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist with Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world thre@@ w the end of the month at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage declined in May by more than 16 % among its high@@ s , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cr@@ ush the global growth .
the market has recovered something about this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the ho@@ ch of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market@@ ability influence the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy has not occurred during the past couple of weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low said at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US not@@ aries .
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what effects on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data to describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is none of the most important co@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in their decision @-@ making decision .
but in the end of the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere alling of the then &apos;s Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could have their mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; del@@ etes around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ ven@@ ed , they can not only monitor the developments in other locations , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art as a science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zac@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over @-@ re@@ actions on financial market movements that apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , atmosph@@ eric member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to Zin@@ ser@@ mining , based decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its head office in three meetings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited impact on growth in the U.S. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market of re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. Pozna≈Ñ , former member of the Committee for the interest of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il happens not to the proximity of this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which it is afraid of a fork in the past , because markets were ex@@ u@@ pri@@ ght , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pozna≈Ñ , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act has still doubled the double mandate and has not mentioned the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe they should be pre@@ destined for the time .

Brazilian society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian government SP@@ RS tries to clarify on sho@@ cking way women on how important good nutrition is during the lact@@ ation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who are working on br@@ aces which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers urged to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake in order to increase about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that the mom should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet fluctu@@ ates women actually affects the genes of their babies and protecting them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet for the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ olina of the sports hall
the Gemein@@ der@@ at Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros of the expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar system .
the plan@@ ations for the long @-@ going turn@@ around of the amber during the period of amber was step@@ ped out step by step : in the latest church council session the aired building application was gr@@ aced without great discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before , the committee had decided to make a motion based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; predic@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the construction construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; pan@@ dem@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is intended to be er@@ ected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ close first and roof @-@ covered &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof @-@ floor for solar systems : &quot; this is how we get a wonderfully large southern h@@ ach , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
the &quot; liberation &quot; was in turn around the attic that is supposed to pre@@ ach of energetic reasons - other than in the development plan - under ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is reduced significantly .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore needed , because the development plan for the attic is not permitted any &quot; exceptions , &quot; with the Bern@@ rie@@ der Gemein@@ der@@ at usually proceeds rather restric@@ tive it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the hall@@ hall@@ way , however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turn@@ around in the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
costs are about 2.3 million euros in costs .
supplements are expected from the school and broad@@ ening support .
the building application will now be submitted to the office for the 18 x 36 metre high hall now for the office .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg hospital should be closed sooner than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be at the hospital of the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are seeing the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district to confirmed the Land@@ r@@ √§t@@ in Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei√ü .
however , a decision on which is the supervis@@ ory board , and the con@@ ven@@ es on the coming Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are put into action then all the less than 50 employees would continue to work in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should go around with fishermen and from the on@@ ward inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees , who can not come to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a place in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei√ü .
the staff were informed of their plans .
triggered the change the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the beginning of the apprenti@@ ces@@ hip at the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic and has now changed to a private office on the direct vicinity of the hospital .
on the question of who should take the follow @-@ up , came according to Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; Fis@@ her &quot; came to the game , who declared himself ready from October 1 to take over management and move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the quot@@ ation in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is specialised in the grad@@ ual and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner station of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
over the next two years , fishermen are supposed to lead to his team when the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board will lead to both houses , until then next year the former Hospital of Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds allowed to be final in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county was planned for 2018 , if the project is currently completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim Hospital .
Land@@ s@@ √§t@@ in Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei√ü , who is also President of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , came out rum@@ ours that the house that is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , in future will be used as accommodation for asylum mot@@ ility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei√ü could not say there are several reflec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care in Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ om@@ an@@ at@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as fishermen about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very compreh@@ ensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , which has been working as the chief doctor for more than 30 years , did not exist .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of the medical director .
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closure over the last decades , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lion are called today ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , a clear favour@@ ites to be given to the fact , however , none .
in the last season the bathing at the B@@ HC sold a pain@@ st@@ ful defeat and have something to utz@@ ing there .

a Tat@@ verd@@ ant has led the police to Lei@@ che who has been missing for Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their bodies left into a canal in Rock@@ enhausen .
one since Saturday ha@@ ste 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate is a violence break down to the victim .
the bodies of young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enhausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like the Prosec@@ ution and the police on Wednesday .
as tat@@ to@@ er@@ ous , a twenty @-@ year @-@ old , twenty @-@ year @-@ old , who was indeed imp@@ acted according to the statement and the investig@@ ator led to the place of origin of the bodies .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on the Sunday morning , after they did not arrive at home after a visit of a autumn in rock@@ enhausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first shoot to personal objects of the victim .
in surveys in friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the missing , finally a Tat@@ a suspic@@ ion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the conf@@ lic@@ ted crime led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enhausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
the ban@@ quet put the authorities in favour of the police inter@@ rog@@ ation to have killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and the bodies were placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presi@@ ded at the Wednesday of the Haf@@ er River , the investig@@ ators put him hom@@ age to the load .

refugees need accommodations : study warned of living @-@ noise
the location on the German housing market is anxi@@ ous .
even more refugees seek a paid place .
the pressure on the housing market grows .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the Distribut@@ ors on the German camper market have started a long time ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people push for a market which is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with cons@@ enting citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing would need to be 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this result is a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social debate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year : this year are published in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units .
thus no 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer obliged to live for the first three months of their stay than an asylum seek@@ ers in an initial investment .
many come across the apartment market and are in the long sn@@ akes in front of the flats .
according to the Statist@@ ical Bundes@@ amt in the last year , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers to rent .
the negative development of the housing itself is not only due to the rising refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ issions in the housing policy of the last years .
Germany has been a living deficit stood out from year to year .
currently missing in the metro@@ politan areas already was around 77@@ 0,000 units , l@@ aments Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study .
many job professionals have lived in big cities in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ voluntarily in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the p@@ endant on the apartment market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has fallen back for the first time in the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to boost new incentives for social housing .
so could be disp@@ ens@@ ed on the bur@@ gl@@ al tax and the plots to be exposed to funded apartments .
in addition , according to the Alliance , attractive tax @-@ prices are needed .
the promot@@ er programme for refugee refu@@ ges of the state bank K@@ f@@ W continues in cities and communities already well .
a good week after the start was finished , with 184 million euros , more than half of the available around ‚Ç¨ 300 million .
now the project could even be sto@@ cked .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia direct cor@@ ridor
after Hungary , there is practically no cir@@ c@@ ading , since more and more refugees choose the way about Croatia .
Zagreb pre@@ aches to the transit of Slovenia to north with no hur@@ dles .
but dangerous is the route nonetheless .
Croatia wants to interact with neighbouring Slovenia across the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the slo@@ ven@@ ian interior , and if it is necessary we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s country is not a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ down of the ser@@ b@@ isch @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reporting the Croatian Fernseh@@ galerie RT@@ L .
Hungary was sailing on its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws that entered into force on the same day do exagger@@ ated asylum @-@ dys@@ functions in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to make refugees happen .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; they can travel through , and we prepare ourselves for that possibility . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but they are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on neighbouring Croatia in the morning .
most of the soldiers identified women from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to Ser@@ bian border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ bian border , the refugees arrive at Gren@@ zz@@ √§@@ une .
it has the border to other dangers : there are still sharp minorities from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ en@@ r√§um@@ er should now create a secure passage quickly .
after Hungary , there is hardly any more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police demanded 36@@ 6 per@@ missions .
just before the door on Monday , there were 54@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws escal@@ ation the overcoming and alleg@@ ation of Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ uns as a crime .
therefore , 35 criminal proceedings have been initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condemned thre@@ aten cuts up to five years and exp@@ ul@@ sion from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to information from the immigration office , we took on Tuesday to the newly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a total of 94 asylum documents , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
below the applic@@ ants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on the Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
however , nobody has granted a chance to get asylum in Hungary asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an ung@@ ar@@ able view Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees before the &quot; Tran@@ itz@@ one &quot; were gathered in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke workers began to rest .
they gathered the tr@@ ash to leave the tens of thousands of people over the past few weeks .
lock@@ ers have been dismant@@ led and was rebuilt from the entrance camp in the bor@@ der@@ land .
the purpose of this uph@@ e@@ av@@ al did not want to express himself .
Austria has only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants at the end of the country , the workers were still in the country .
around 1400 people are waiting for the return to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning of the German authorities .
in Tro@@ ass@@ ing regularly , smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor drove &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ ged &quot; over the borders
&quot; we were busy following the bridge on Sunday with the au@@ fr@@ aming when suddenly ten people were standing with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so Wern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprisingly down to Austria because of the refugee stro@@ m of the railway traffic with Austria , was for them in Wern@@ stein conclusion , &quot; so Stad@@ ler that offered immediately his help and took the gest@@ ures along with two further hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we used the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once , with J@@ ause and drinks .
we said the same , we bring it by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N chat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has been very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the star@@ red mig@@ rate states have risen on the Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to be postpon@@ ed after the short term that the railway traffic to Germany was hi@@ red , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was opened in front of the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border in general is generally high in the course .
the joined @-@ festival with the Bav@@ arian neighbours , appearing on Sunday , had previously a two @-@ race sport@@ y - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n now sends more bri@@ cks to us now , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy :
instead of helping in the camp R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke immediately in the construction of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor , has formally put up the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ lo@@ od of National Soci@@ alism .
suffering from this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the p@@ oul@@ try will find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gel@@ ob@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will become a great challenge , given the persistent refugee currents and the coming winter , with us to establish decent ties for protective seek@@ ers .
and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Kon@@ rad in search of 35.@@ 000 winter@@ time lod@@ g@@ ings
Kon@@ rad has all hands to do with the refugee treatment .
Christian Kon@@ rad is used to say that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to raise lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the premi@@ er center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported one of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without a great vort@@ ex , said Kon@@ rad , and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ ship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the interior spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cr@@ iti@@ ful situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Kon@@ rad calculated with a need of ‚Ç¨ 8@@ 5,000 ins in the h@@ ay year .
in order to meet the number , more than 35,@@ 000 accommodations must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,@@ 000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ rad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the govern@@ ors .
these would have been promised to make lod@@ g@@ ings even for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Ober@@ √∂sterreich it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Con@@ rad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , thereby to be trans@@ figured out how the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations places the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator also in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the platform can provide private people straight@@ for@@ war@@ dly accommodation available .
additionally , one hopes to hotels that are empty during the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ rad and Mai@@ er crit@@ ici@@ zed yesterday the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of need , it could not be that lod@@ g@@ hosts have to have a certain height of the tow@@ el @-@ card or size of the upper right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a short time would have to apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that he was more successful in contrast to the home of Germany , Kon@@ rad @-@ founded with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , that one does not say without further to the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic no costs as they said themselves .
your employees want to increase them from three to four .
so far the own quest@@ s was still not successful .
Kon@@ rad wanted to establish a container at the square Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there is obviously issues with the permission .
Linz is for a better distribution
first an opening of the municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommod@@ ated refugees is planning the city of Linz .
at the moment this is not necessary , as the persons affected can currently take place without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
but for the emergency , further sites are to be tested in their di@@ vi@@ ability .
critic@@ isms of the town chief executive of the division of refugees within the Bundes@@ land .
other areas must also make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone at the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) has registered the govern@@ or Josef W@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday that further action takes place in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the further voy@@ age of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special tra@@ its with refugees to Germany will not be there any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seek@@ ers would however have got to Germany with regular intervals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states called for an even greater eurozone solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria introduces him to its borders , is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the Director@@ ate @-@ General of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production building , the listed IT @-@ group S &amp; T is mobili@@ zed ; the rest ( 2,7@@ 00@@ square meter ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative businesses from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later to become ac@@ qui@@ eter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the start , S &amp; D wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which there is a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1,7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the state Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and the Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters rests in the building are rented out , for further 40 percent give requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ as opened second store in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are central .
actually we wanted to set out a dog for a few days .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ year of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ market @-@ Ark@@ ade short @-@ cut @-@ cut : eventually she has improved the growth in the shape of a further business location .
in Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which they s@@ ells among other cases bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and threads of various manufacturers , now all of the or@@ nam@@ ing bags of the brand Fur@@ la , w@@ allet is about 75 euros .
larger po@@ ckets and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
several weeks ago it was changed .
&quot; but I have long over@@ laid down if I want to open a shop , &quot; she says broad .
decisive for the decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la @-@ producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own location , in which only its hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the mer@@ ci@@ fy in the Gre@@ ater Linz , which this brand sell , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has its own Italian roots .
your fashion interest has put up wide from her mother in the cr@@ adle .
it t@@ ends to me most when something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why such a number of women looking at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in consumption , the professional lady can not answer with last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of each out@@ fit is being upgraded .
the ro@@ ly@@ ly@@ maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ √§l@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ gi@@ ver .
this property also communic@@ ates man@@ ders with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become the U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for Ex@@ change@@ able .
whether it is notably expressed by foreign , journalist , journalists , or facts are revealed in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. president goes power@@ fully to the election campaign .
and it also s@@ cul@@ ates well .
this is also recorded in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the estate @-@ millions comes from .
the New Yorker with the Com@@ promis@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept for many of the Win@@ zer@@ dorf at the Wein@@ stra√üe .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related about -@@ ump@@ y corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ town in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned out a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about his goal , migh@@ ti@@ est man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that is somehow thr@@ illing but are not deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ t has turned out a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous Spr@@ ands , which besides Tr@@ ump is also one of the Ket@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump that is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y comes in the Kings of K@@ all@@ town , &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ town .
to the king of the heart , he has not brought it there .
while there was respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ign@@ ing the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a bit of a big la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; random@@ ly lou@@ der of the nickname , the K@@ all@@ city in the county , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - zu Hoch@@ deutsch : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened in the USA a pub for Gold@@ gr@@ √§@@ ber .
Grund@@ stein des Immobilien@@ konz@@ ert were the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from trag@@ ic@@ ism : your desire to return to the country at the time of the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ ine was belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once ruled out without permission was the director of the Institute for pf@@ alz history and folk dancing , Roland Paul , declared film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is contrast to the mit@@ ro@@ sive statements of the desc@@ endant .
the latter had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to ex@@ pound illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ls , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a remote @-@ run m@@ umps ( &quot; the gran@@ ny was a born baby , the grand@@ pa was sal@@ v@@ ot Heinz . ) .
the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so up@@ setting . &quot;
does he believes that Tr@@ ump happens ?
&quot; I cannot imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retirement in Veronika Sch@@ r@@ amm noted that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz during a visit to something for the church @-@ organ donated what was generally well received .
&quot; I cannot imagine the Donald not , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they stand there better if he does not make the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had been in the U.S. during the time of his grandfather in the US , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; my president is yes , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without the President of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for the Tr@@ ump long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 cinema , even in the US aw@@ ok@@ en interest .
the Upper Bav@@ arian town of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf . &quot;
out of the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ ennig , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ village was awarded in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden on Wednesday the award for gentle tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ d@@ √∂rfer . &quot;
in the neighboring land the dor@@ sal Alpine Club is responsible for the award of the award .
a &quot; Berg@@ sti@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; should have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of his surface must be designated as a protective area .

the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ stag made the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the hosts David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week series of international television letters , to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the shelf seemed to play no role for the Australian TV audience , since Sun@@ rise is an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spect@@ ators at the five capitals , in comparison to the Today 33@@ 9,@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the rating for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3.000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) .
today , the last few months Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August Today was on average 3@@ 18.@@ 000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance passed between 4@@ 0,000 and 5@@ 0,000 .
up to date in September Sun@@ rise is at an average 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spect@@ ators to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happens every morning .
the win@@ ch of change affects this morning more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are ok , thanks for the review !

the last three agree in that : PhD &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret is un@@ covered ? ...
Lana je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly manifest who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally ended , was wr@@ apped in biggest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be sure if they have the one that the last rose has received .
but when we with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana je@@ av@@ ons ( Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , they might not acci@@ dentally have an indication of who will be the vic@@ t@@ orious .
Sam Wood continues his lips until the finals on Thursday is sealed .
all three women have reli@@ ed in a ly@@ rical way of why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as the reason why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If do not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; they could become their answers to the game board , who won the heart of the Bachelor .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki have both fast - except itself - Mack@@ ay serves as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies have noticed that they were quite compatible and I have thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on &apos;s Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her perspective , Mack@@ ay said that the sk@@ et@@ ch@@ ant last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The One &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this obviously is not just a game - I &apos;m now subject to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they asked , whom Wood was to choose , if not them , that was they pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor will be on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to start their NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in their move to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent to an impressive open plan working day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank , as he lost a lack of angel , as it did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League @-@ Version on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a p@@ unt return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula showed its true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula increased Hay@@ ne also publicly at his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter &apos;s In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams Co@@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et him to forget his ver@@ ted catch , and to worry about the next game .
J@@ arr@@ spoke Hay@@ ne pat@@ ched with a p@@ unt which was restored in the first quarter of the Min@@ nes@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start to hopes the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian coun@@ ties for his NF@@ L debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playground and left the Australian radio station Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a low start in his NF@@ L career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne spoiled the car@@ se@@ ater with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ √ºt in 2007 , when a pass was conducted at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get promises in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rural fraction of the free vot@@ ings will be dar@@ ing up to Friday in the French @-@ French commun@@ e .
actually , were completely different main themes .
however , the record number of refugees also domin@@ ates the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course the issue is asylum the cl@@ ause &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UNO @-@ protective zones for refugees in Syria , as has been during the Yugoslavia in the nin@@ et@@ een years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not go on , we need to get to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ tor@@ ate boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subscription asylum seek@@ ers want to make up the free elec@@ tors as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ w@@ anger also required more personnel for the administration , responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW leader is crit@@ ici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are engaged in the nation@@ wide common standards of the Bundes@@ l√§nder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is shifting others not &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to be able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the state policy should not fall under the table under the table .
a couple of years of permanent terror remains on the agenda : the policy @-@ policy .

4 people killed , after polic@@ emen b@@ ust @-@ fin on the protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police ban@@ qu@@ ee in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , intro@@ duc@@ tory District Apost@@ les said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , taking some of you stones and fire bom@@ bs .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ √§n@@ z@@ as and then shot in the air before it rec@@ ur on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were inju@@ red , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the amount of rubber bul@@ lets , known by which they can kill , which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously such a high death rate produced .
the discussion was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the Western Nepal between the ethnic group of the dawn , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were killed in violent conflicts since the 10 .

most overweight di@@ ab@@ etics can be helpful in weight loss .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easy to overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last after a new study for at least five years .
it is still too early to say if easy overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a leit@@ article about the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight loss @-@ operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years in obesity operations for the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes has been proven to be efficient , but most studies were carried out with people who are disease @-@ suffering from a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two kinds of obesity and stomach cross@@ breeding - for medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes among people who were slightly obes@@ e .
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this surgery s@@ ank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I at those who were not @-@ surgical Diabetes treatments were roughly equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ went to a surgical procedure , there are 36 % of diabetes in 36 % , and partially in 28 % partially .
in the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group , in comparison with the diabetes only one percent and partly only about two percent .
in addition , the results were among the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also awak@@ ened the patient @-@ blood level of hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time .
H√§@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researcher .
after surgery , the average em@@ mo@@ p sun@@ sh@@ am A@@ 1@@ c level of about 9 percent to approximately 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflect in the improved hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leit@@ ner@@ ed researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also provide average results with the two kinds of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved bigger down@@ time in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and H√§@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2 % ) and recorded a complete defeat of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study he@@ avier people in Sweden that runs surgery to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to obes@@ e people who under@@ gone an obesity operation , about 29 per cent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group , un@@ conventional methods tried .
although the new study does not have an advantage for survival in the surgery @-@ patient , Black@@ stone said it is so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increasing risk of death or kidney illness , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they accum@@ ulate these genetic modification , have joined their body with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really heavy . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ news
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take up every refugees , said the Dalai Lama and imp@@ lied that the real solution of refugee crisis is in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader asked to end the violence in the refugees of refugees .
the Dalai Lama was addressing the problem of the continuous refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford .
he urged that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries is not ad@@ mired at the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he empha@@ sized that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end we have to think about how the killing in their countries is dimin@@ ished .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent response by the USA was a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after 11 September I have expressed my p@@ ity in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence one , and that has led unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four @-@ fold increase of intake inf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the past 4 years
po@@ is@@ controlled centers in the United States report on an almost 400 @-@ percentage increase in number of children under the age of twelve who swal@@ low the strong mobile inf@@ ect@@ ant , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of manually inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the tox@@ ins ass@@ ass@@ ination were reported , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go into emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children can visi@@ bly drink inf@@ ect@@ ants while some of them do to impress their friends or because of a MU@@ T@@ PRO@@ BE on social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mouth water in order to obtain a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be arranged by attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ t@@ led .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ wberry , wine @-@ grapes and orange juice , which are very appealing for children .
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with to@@ dd@@ lers , few inj@@ ectors are already able to lead the alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; it is most concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not leave am@@ bu@@ ck whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ru@@ cks of after stra@@ wberry who had taken shelter in school was brought into an emergency recovery .
their blood @-@ alco@@ hol@@ ism was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold that applies in an adult law as being dr@@ unk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor , who treated it in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah spoke their words and was unable to go when she came to emergency .
doctors over@@ w@@ ned them overnight in a separate children &apos;s disease on signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had lost their head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said J@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ dav@@ s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ecting sugar inf@@ ect@@ ant outside the reach of the child .
on alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario women after the gor@@ ge of hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ clear@@ er ingredient .
the employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol has been enth@@ used , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ yl@@ alcohol , which has been noted as substance .
in January , three students in the fourth category began in the state of New York , their &quot; gem@@ stone , &quot; marked by anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; so announces a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and ex@@ iles they out of their space .

de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador of Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ranking is not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the Ran@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around the things around , s@@ amp@@ ant D@@ eil@@ a .

now we want to get out of it as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we all feel the same thing - but we must go on .
we really need to truly support Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
together , there is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole in the same period at EUR 10,000 in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate ( 5.5 per cent exceeded that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the office for Nationale statistics ( ons ) exhibited .
meanwhile , the employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 for the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.4 percent - a number above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Perman@@ ent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly one year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to stay part of the UK .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market , with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will be a witness to a revolution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the fat@@ chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is created by the Gi@@ ft@@ sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of His death .
the invitation was launched already for the first time in January beyond his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I coinci@@ ded .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists must be allowed to see in the United States , and there are often more applications available as seats available , to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media platforms from 12 to five .
who is chosen will be able to observe it emotional .
I cannot do this .
in addition to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps , I will sit with like Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps with which I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we lau@@ gh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to take which I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma rejected me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the pris@@ oner , as he wants , and you get access .
I am descri@@ bing me with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they ensure that they could have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses anytime .
but he wants that an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ ub@@ gu@@ ardian of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter the details here again .
I can not say that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese might be guilty of being an ar@@ dent of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that it is not guilty of the murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a deaths .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim , really objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters to which you can apply for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police tra@@ ys sur@@ fers to come from the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale police officer remained dry , while he reason@@ ed the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt of a man of Perth to im@@ pose the police was un@@ successful when he found himself in the shallow and sum@@ p@@ ent water , only a few meters from a police officer &apos; tried to persu@@ ade him to go to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday to a hous@@ ebo@@ at break@@ age in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
when she discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape in direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the midst of water , and said &apos; I come not out , come and get myself , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ hav@@ ec was not too enthusiastic about it to do its unique shape , so he turned to be a reliable t@@ actic - &quot; A good police act . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to send him out and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year , and dro@@ w@@ ned to end the race at once .
he took on the ste@@ wards and the integrity of Racing Victoria and claimed that she concluded a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate scr@@ at@@ ching Lady Tat@@ ai because of a rac@@ ec@@ oming treatment , the last st@@ roh@@ l@@ m on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing , and he found himself under difficult circumstances , when it went to the positive Kob@@ alt ton@@ ing at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age court , and didn &apos;t want to see it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see how much aff@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been eating long for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything came up once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know that it continues .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to express our core , and I want my owners think I &apos;m trying my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do it , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think , what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy &apos;s bom@@ b have been tou@@ ching the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity of the integr@@ ates have tried to wi@@ ped onto his barn .
&quot; before 18 months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - I will name if I ask - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they certainly should put into their n@@ oses , because they had to summar@@ ise myself , failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I bring it to the view that it is personally ?
is the RV@@ L hur@@ ting itself and makes people responsible outside trainers with regard to what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I as bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think out there that I am .
maybe they have to take me my own license and I have no doubt that what I say , they can now think about it now .
but I arrived at the point where I didn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ ct@@ m levels of the co@@ aches have been built with the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt @-@ investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he said that he could throw his licence over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the incomplete Master of Black Caviar , marked the racing tags i@@ tion procedure &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been placed on the horse key , which is contra@@ sting to the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must assume responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators got er@@ ron@@ eous battles on the leg .
it could have been this evening so .
it could have been a whole day yesterday , whatever it was .
and it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who raise these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy proposes to fight against ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations of ring claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has chosen a cr@@ iti@@ que of his players to be the &quot; Agenda &quot; of the two Premier League Favorites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will have allowed the &quot; ring @-@ players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ zes Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a little hidden note to the Storm team after his crew had reached the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boy on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star player &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland may not be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the f@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that it was focused on the tac@@ kling only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ wald added that the criticism of two leading co@@ aches in his team expresses him confident as it was de@@ duc@@ ting that they were troub@@ led to be cap@@ tiv@@ ated by the Storm team .
&quot; it always comes up - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ k√§@@ mpfe are speaking , when she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have nothing changed in our def@@ ender system or the techniques all year . but over the last six weeks we have done our contact at Tac@@ cles on a real focus and this did for us the turning point .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to lose so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny , as this always comes up again at this time of year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy certainly attacked the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and reminded that Benn@@ ett &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra . the Premier League won in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening , and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was crit@@ ici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a cross@@ roads .
but now he has a team who can play and play it as thr@@ illing , especially his younger players with their speed .
that is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play as those .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about to play against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think of us than the big games went .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game bronze against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the bronze was probably a good game , but I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our play was 20 : 18 , there were two more testing in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks , and no points do something gri@@ pping ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
if they mention us it means that we will still meet them in a phase .
the Storm team has free this weekend as they have won the right to receive North Queensland Cow@@ boy or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday evening in the A@@ ria Park . ticket sales begin starting next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ Deposit to Drug Ad@@ diction
a man who may possibly thre@@ aten a lifetime punishment due to his understanding , into the possession of 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams , to come back to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ released .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal pol@@ y found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ accused at marina in the morning and later at the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where the police found 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of the dr@@ um in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ related punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial quantity co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the caf√© might be of an inno@@ cu@@ ous reason .
the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the flood danger at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in the case of a law , he weigh@@ ed the police on his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the sound @-@ made explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a total of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to hold him away , not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit except in the conditions that he mu@@ st@@ ori@@ ze his Australian and Ser@@ b Pass , when the police mel@@ ted every day and stick to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an Hog@@ g used the phone of girls to lo@@ wer@@ ate P@@ √§d@@ oph@@ ile to sending pictures
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of a 11 year old girl , to request some pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Hog@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this as@@ le@@ ep , log@@ ged in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ connected images of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sle@@ ep@@ tive Hog@@ g .
it looked through , found the conf@@ using reports and al@@ arm@@ ing immediately her mother .
the police looked at it and saw the five pictures , analysed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; web research &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the terms used for the search for an in@@ appropriate images of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hog@@ re@@ claimed the officials he did it as it would have done to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a polic@@ eman to be a polic@@ eman &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government consultant E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction that he ad@@ dic@@ ted to scar@@ ce people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave to that the sou@@ ks were performed on the computer by him , but said it was to happen because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to scar@@ ed P@@ √§d@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his talks with the un@@ known person who sent him the pictures to send him more photos .
he said that he did it to lo@@ osen them .
he said that he is sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
Ms Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the tre@@ mb@@ ling and in the cr@@ ying .
it then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone , and con@@ front the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the indic@@ tee computer and Play@@ station benef@@ itted to speak with girl who looked much younger than he .
Hog@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , found guilty ple@@ th@@ fully in the meaning of the indic@@ t@@ ment to have un@@ law@@ ed pictures of children on June 14 last year , and have not appeared before the court hearing a hearing on March 24 this year .
attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Hog@@ g does not appear in the tab of sexual crimes , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; can be found in his understanding .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air CAR@@ MI@@ CHA@@ EL con@@ cludes the jud@@ gement seat until October to get background reports on social work .
Hog@@ re@@ g was granted in this case , however , was kept in cust@@ ody for hear@@ ings on other cases in pro@@ visional cust@@ ody .
he was still taken into the list of sexual crimes under the date of judgment .

Friday has been able to look at the sun once more .
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers are showing their innovations on the I@@ AA .
2015 is mainly moving to Komp@@ ak@@ tw@@ agen , which is currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : approximately 28,@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations dropped according to the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August to this segment .
this is also reflected on the I@@ AA ( audience days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ urist@@ ic concept and new Ober@@ kl@@ asse@@ - and luxury cars are introduced in this year especially many new comp@@ ass models .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra that will be available at the dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model , &quot; said Opel @-@ Chief Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
so that the volume model also s@@ ells itself well , the new A@@ stra will continue to become much more expensive .
Opel is placing an entry below the largest cont@@ enders VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current A@@ stra will cost from 16 990 .
the A@@ stra are available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
moreover , the H@@ esse represents another diesel engine and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 HP up to 147 kW / / 200 PS , for the first time also three cy@@ lin@@ ders and gas@@ oline engines .
different from the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus is the Opel A@@ stra first as fifth .
as a second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi which is already visible on the I@@ AA .
and what will be gone next to the A@@ stra on the I@@ AA still to new comp@@ actor ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault shows the fourth generation of his A@@ stra @-@ competition M√©@@ gan@@ e &apos;s race .
at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as five @-@ fifth in a conventional and an acc@@ ented prot@@ rac@@ ted version .
in the trade he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then also as com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Parliament wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
thereby the compact ot@@ iti fits with its cur@@ ved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the base model will get a gas@@ oline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter @-@ tur@@ bom@@ bed and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS .
the maximum torque is by manufactur@@ er@@ statements at 170 New@@ t@@ meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed , the comp@@ actor @-@ class DS 4 is to be seen at the I@@ AA .
outside on the outside , the designer of the no@@ ble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n desc@@ ends mainly took hands on the front part : here the radi@@ ator was newly drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was retro@@ fitted , reduces the number of buttons by a touch@@ screen and the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ play .
in addition , on the I@@ AA in Komp@@ ak@@ t@@ klasse , a series of over@@ worked and new variations , such as the face @-@ class Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : 5 square metres cell are deser@@ ved
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court has given an ex @-@ pris@@ oner of the t@@ una @-@ cat@@ ch@@ ment it@@ enti@@ ls , which was lod@@ ged during the months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are in to small cells .
this was the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in a decision on Wednesday published Wednesday .
those affected can judge the judges even then on money if they were locked only a few days in the too narrow rooms ( AZ . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ pris@@ oner with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommod@@ ated in the judicial process of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 ; the toil@@ ette was spatial not separate .
after that , the man , who , according to the name of his wal@@ den , has now been in free walking , has been displ@@ aced in a larger cell .
his counter@@ part press due to un@@ worthy resistance conditions against the State of Berlin .
but the Constitu@@ tional council did away the judgment of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and directed the case to the renewed regulatory test .
they see the human dignity of the man .
Kammer@@ weg will now decide on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons of the frag@@ ment period only a few days of harbour @-@ days for the compensation are decisive , be an ou@@ tri@@ ght was called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an aw@@ k@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cham@@ al Court has now to clarify the amount of money damage .
the Constitu@@ tional Council in the past often have strengthened the rights of pris@@ oner .
so they spoke until in April a pris@@ oner ad@@ verse , because it was naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a choice of 2011 also according to the multi @-@ user layout of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , who had made a decent accommodation in a parall@@ el@@ fall in November 2009 .
the then cl@@ ut@@ or was carried out every day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons came in the last weeks due to the lack of staff in the head@@ lines .
the prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggressi@@ vity rises , even to bat , it should have been due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to information of the judicial black@@ mailing , 21 places in Te@@ gel due to young angels did not take place , 19 shall drop away .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees has a huge challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to adopt them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry for Germany , following statement by vice @-@ president Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany is able to take part in a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated with respect to the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
they are needed for different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the pl@@ ess@@ ary Institute ) apartments every year - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it was built until now ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space , but above all in affordable rates : 600@@ 00 bis 800@@ 00 IR @-@ apartments from rental price @-@ binding , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments will also apply refugees .
Bundes@@ minist@@ erin Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) is therefore keen to double the promotion , at present 518 million at one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments each year would have to arise and to do this , the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion each year .
inev@@ it@@ ably , scientists and Bundes@@ minist@@ ries agree that there should also be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction .
according to the estimates by the Institute for labour market research and occupational research , 55 percent of the refugees can be active in Germany over the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not have been asked systematically for their qualification to help them start with , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they will find employment in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission gift , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the spect@@ ators , says Mig@@ r@@ ation@@ alist Diet@@ rich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt .
in Germany , he has given a political transition according to Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt : from the labour market offered for refugees for recognition of work .
while there was an employment bot for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this in November 2014 was reduced to three months , as well as the resi@@ dences to be restricted to an apartment location .
in society - also because of the lack of qualified labour - mostly the point of view should be sei@@ zed that refugees should be enabled more quickly to access the labour market .
there is a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lacking German knowledge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far there is still no substitute for general and pract@@ ition@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies also show that jobs most often be convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
so , the construction of networks is therefore for the view of Thr@@ ace of the king@@ d@@ oms into work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has stated that only a few refugees leave their children to the nur@@ series , estimated at ten to 15 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the kid@@ n@@ apped parents it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , spread cra@@ w@@ ett@@ el in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rising from the large number of refugees would try to increase the Berlin Senate , to increase the training capacity - by paying more specialist schools .
in these countries , students are being prepared without a clear cogn@@ ition in welcome education at the lessons .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , like in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage , says Beate St@@ journeys from the Berlin school administration .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ led the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , inter@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) but gave up his attitude now .
Studi@@ ar@@ lu@@ ct@@ ur refugees could be facilit@@ ated to expand access to the university .
because refugees with a residence or depos@@ itors do not receive any achievements after the asylum application law , if they start studying .
the latter is basically no BA@@ F√∂@@ G because it does not fall under the circle of the vote @-@ authorized persons .
toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany until now four years to be eligible for BA@@ F√∂@@ G @-@ justified , from 1 January 2016 to short@@ ens this margin to 15 months .
but this financing must also be closed , and calls for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins Under@@ secret@@ ary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ F√∂@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should neg@@ le@@ ct the same rights to Islam as it has the churches , and the existing state of Ch@@ urches able to continue to develop a new state of religions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important would also be the establishment of an Islamic charity association , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights are also duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear point of contact and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to deal with some supervision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also part of the willingness to face it against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be entered to Germany .
those who wanted to have such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately made their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk .
he suggested in transl@@ ating the Basic Law to arab@@ ic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in future .
this also has to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany - as a result of European decisions , a anti @-@ discrimination place has been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a general gender equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it gets too slow , how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist mot@@ if systematically ignored .
equal opportunities for all : what Mig@@ ran@@ ten@@ ers and stak@@ eholder groups are already calling for a long time and commit to international agreements , such as the anti @-@ racial conflict , must be a reality when the country remain peaceful and its new citizens are supposed to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany has been able to provide medical aid to the so far , means that the German president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , k@@ isses must additional money flow into the system .
to avoid t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls to im@@ part all com@@ ers in the course of the registration of health cards .
provided performances could be demol@@ ished later with the Bundes@@ l√§nder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able so many people have shown the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Str@@ ong catalog &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which I see the asylum application law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise make the doctors especially the language barriers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even so far , the Berlin health care of The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be more inf@@ il@@ ater@@ al than other patients &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only in clinics , also in medical offices you would have to charge interpre@@ ter .
it would be helped many refugees but also with more general pract@@ ition@@ ers in the emergency out@@ patient .
and with a different diagnostic eye .
among refugee traff@@ ics , for instance , there are significantly more unden@@ i@@ able disabilities , and among the young people go about HIV education .
but with the partially other cases of disease , German doctors are drawn from their education but clearly , means Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the lack of trouble , whether by the refugees perhaps even alle@@ vi@@ ation in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had had a high @-@ evol@@ ving education system , several refugees even doctors .
in order to pract@@ ise , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualification and do not necessarily verify ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees in Germany will be psychological psych@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tic ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically sick : most of them suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic b@@ bing disorder or under depression .
particularly vulnerable , hes@@ itance , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study published by the Technical University of Munich that every fifth , Syrian refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ mati@@ astic observation technique is suffering from other things by so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , verti@@ go , cardi@@ ac and de@@ pu@@ zz@@ ing .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration @-@ disorders , strong kno@@ ck and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically sick refugees get a psych@@ otherapy .
indeed , psych@@ ically sick asylum seek@@ ers can ask an application for a psych@@ otherapy , but the treatment normally takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly experts or doctors , who are not trained for the mental disorders , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
these lead frequently to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s Guide , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year from a podium .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly became popular on social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also deteri@@ or@@ ated by members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous deaths , and they have been warned to accompany the speech of Mr Mu@@ gabe , called Bu@@ hr@@ oked .
last month they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the location of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven oppos@@ itions @-@ politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , have warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es speech .
they war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that the imm@@ unity ends in parliament and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .
the chief speaker said that Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i @-@ guided Party is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to demol@@ ish 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and saving effort from the company &apos;s services .
HP will split up later this year into two listed companies , and separate the computer and printers of his fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job de@@ generated leads to a stress of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who should guide the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is HP today and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be concentr@@ ating on the provision of integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is issued a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , to manufacture electric plants and whose pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring to cope with the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC @-@ manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on conviction that closely foc@@ uss@@ ed companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates just before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere must be
Wen@@ ger stressed toward Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if its rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play it before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly not miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate k@@ nu@@ ckl@@ ing injury , and then returned to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury do not risk the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that does not treat well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ckl@@ es or with the inju@@ ries which he had before .
this may be true of purely medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further inju@@ ries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Premier In@@ ju@@ ries Ltd shares 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ears since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in only 65 out of ar@@ sen@@ al , in the last five seasons .
the broader image for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs , who have recorded most vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepted the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the threat rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes if you come back from an injury , you have a random period , a time in which you will have to strengthen your body and gain energy @-@ power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ t@@ enh@@ am Hot@@ sp@@ ur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team .
H√©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta start to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and to give players who need it , a small break @-@ up , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although the ar@@ sen@@ al clear favour@@ ites are to continue by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Sta@@ dion in Zagreb is one of the playing places with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; in@@ vin@@ ci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , measured on the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion of the ar@@ sen@@ al being pulled out of the past season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains of the distant hope , with its management to lead the association to his first European election tri@@ umph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy @-@ Show , who gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar specim@@ en in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now still dou@@ bt@@ less than ever before , how su@@ icide resi@@ des among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ ho@@ ch .
in 2013 it was the most important deaths of men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ner ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ ed@@ itary life ) in 2015 , as the year of the man , with the aim of finding the culture into question , the men are hin@@ dered to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study involving more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with anti@@ depress@@ ants men@@ tions that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery .
for those who are not depress@@ ant , hal@@ ved a circle of spiritual healthy friends the risk of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends who can make a friendship again .
in the age of social media @-@ led communication , with its focus on style on substance , the in@@ medi@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even though in reality the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is domin@@ ating by what psych@@ ologist extr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more profound .
and as a video player invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the Beautiful at Friends was that this foc@@ uss@@ ing on the head was put on .
every character was not defined by his labor , but by his personality , which gli@@ stering through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler of frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football at football matches , and the nost@@ algia of Ros@@ s to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can definitely be referred to , even if they often sit back to explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone call I explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and risk @-@ mur@@ dered , has truly clearly demonstrated to me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come com@@ promising &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling of being perceived as a weakness if people are openly talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ulatory cop@@ mechanisms .
it presents very clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider &quot; inform@@ s about the phone the man in moments of despair may also help , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you &apos;re visiting this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely new scenery , why do not take your friends a drink in Central Per@@ k .

di Maria meets in order to help PSG , Malm@@ √∂ .
angel Di Maria celebrate with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani to his hand against Malm@@ √∂ .
di Maria meets its debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to move on Malm@@ √∂ .
here are the record &apos;s report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain &apos;s Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ quet stadium on Tuesday started .
di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League game as PSG @-@ player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before they finally achieved its pre@@ jump , when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ ball@@ ad in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sh@@ ei@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A needs a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they are not only stri@@ ving for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points there was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovi@@ vi@@ cs missed odds against the gate . he was later played in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his illustrations in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or up@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to have in the course of season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I &apos;m regre@@ t@@ table that we did not see one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to his breach in one of three changes in the Paris @-@ team which could hold on his own seat at the weekend from Bordeaux in the First League , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ean wing stor@@ mer was described as the man that was accepted in the next month of Manchester , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defence prior to Johan Wil@@ and passing it into the long corner of the multilingual network .
if anyone believed that PSG would win a great victory that was disappointed .
Malm@@ √∂ found the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off , in order to reach this level , joined in an@@ op@@ lane , with nine national players in the field and was bor@@ row@@ ed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy enemy .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola J@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far from Kevin Tr@@ p P@@ fo@@ sten at the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead she sometimes gave himself , with some fail@@ ures and bad rivers , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was b@@ apti@@ zed in the first half of the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani started his rest@@ art .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow @-@ players to the game and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic to turned to T@@ Di Maria in a shooting what was caught by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the P@@ fo@@ sten ...
the second gate came finally shortly after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay The Uruguay had thus achieved his six@@ teen Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic et a left f@@ ist of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts on the Malm@@ √∂ would be able to stop in the game , and only a superb understanding of Wil@@ der from the shortest distance in order to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to keep the end result before replacement of the Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi could be recognized as a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ eide , gave later that PSG played a class about his team and the Norwegian said , &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league who did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat ab in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and Europ@@ am@@ eister X@@ avi has been playing for summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Kat@@ ar
FC Bayern was apparently played just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which played back then for the FC Barcelona .
eight times of Spanish champion , three times Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger , four times champion league , two times club master , a time World Champion - the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer , the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years has left the FC Barcelona and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca betra@@ ys X@@ avi , X@@ avi is now that he was already standing before the roundabout in Barcelona before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; you told me that Bar@@ √ßa I would like to sell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid was at that time everything , we know nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered member of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ters wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not swit@@ ched
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today is working for the German record master : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has put Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P said that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he won me crazy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi would be off .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against the Bavaria about the entire distance on the lawn , set the reds of ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end of the Beng@@ sl@@ assen Triumph .

Dam@@ on and Brown have joined the presence of the presence of Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to challenge people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a gro@@ ove that is be@@ aten from her white shar@@ k .

&apos; American Ninja W@@ arri@@ or &apos; cr@@ √∂n@@ t first champion
professional sport clim@@ bers and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who took the American nin@@ W@@ arri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ with his home .
the competition show , which just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could shut up all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season @-@ finals there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the finals .
the last task belonged to climbing at a 75 foot long clim@@ bers in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended the task within time , which was the first ath@@ l@@ ete to complete the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Ninja W@@ arri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster than made him winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the fier@@ ce victory , still under the shock over the profit of the Grand price of 1 million $ .
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never deser@@ ved more than 10,000 $ or to live , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his p@@ ile Money .
as suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the producer producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finale and why B@@ ritten , even though he ended the course at all , does not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , he will get the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changes , it gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe that he was swe@@ pt upon something else .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone then I am happy that he &apos;s Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac was just as felt if they had changed roles .
America Ninja W@@ arri@@ or was extended for one aspir@@ ation , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers We@@ ar at Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OLI@@ S@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
previously they used one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , in this part they played perfectly against Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the T@@ wins flour@@ ished a chance to climb within a half of the Houston branch offices for the second American League of Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp more than a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ras@@ mus .
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive support , as Detroit stood three times in the first two cour@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three of them .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of each game , and so I really want to go down in the game .
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two of us , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he has since had four hits of the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has well cur@@ ved the head@@ board , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said J@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , seen much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three rings in the rear @-@ meeting at the end of the seventh ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back in the game .
centre F@@ iel@@ o B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left dirt line .
Right to Aaron H@@ icks reached a b@@ unt , and Simon got his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he replaced by the left @-@ handed Zal@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived wall , the only man who has been confronted with whom he was confronted , in front of the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ played a Two @-@ run @-@ run by the rectang@@ le handed .
with a pair of run@@ ners and the completion @-@ run by the second super@@ vised by the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the major League for 27 times in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
since Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ne@@ ath , , wall is a R@@ BI @-@ Double against the C@@ loser der Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right hand stands S@@ ano with three pitches for his fifth Save State .
Detroit benef@@ itted to the pre@@ l@@ ude of the game from a still not movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three b@@ uns in the first two cour@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the play of the viol@@ ability of the inju@@ ries , having been missing because of a back pain over a month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I feel more comfortable than I felt , and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches as the Third In@@ ning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game who made a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed to get another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single von Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not see very well , but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was found in a pitch @-@ Count , sco@@ red no points in the third inning before being replaced by the ri@@ ver A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three of us at six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez difference because of an infrin@@ gement of the throw @-@ school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the Schul@@ ter of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since the middle of August on the off@@ ending list due to a shoulder @-@ dist@@ or@@ tion , shall be activated for starting on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the off@@ ert list is cancelled to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he has been purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was ste@@ ep@@ ed since 20 August because of a dis@@ ser@@ tation in the right hip .

hundreds of refugees trying to go to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in them are to be converted into emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden on the Tuesday evening .
it calculated with 450 to 750 in the coming refugees .
several sport@@ s@@ men of the h@@ ess@@ men state capital have been prepared in the past few days for that case .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily cut there .
they shall then be re@@ distributed to other municipalities .
alone in the past ten days , according to the relevant government ministers were to have arrived at the G@@ ie√üen 7@@ 500 people in Hessen .

Isch@@ g : German military measures in Syria an Option
the head of the Munich &apos;s security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for one possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the determined sur@@ think about military action options may not take place without Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cast the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago he was happy that the cup of a military involvement in Germany has been acquired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict conver@@ ged before our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for the refugees .
Austria controls in southern and eastern borders
Austria has once again implemented Austria to its southern and Eastern borders .
the Austrian inter@@ minist@@ ator Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , after Hungary , no one will now be returned .
also Germany did not leave refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that is as agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement that could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , there were already relevant talks between the Director@@ ate @-@ General for Public Safety and Author@@ ities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
concrete numbers never put them and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees dropped from Hungary to Austria in recent days .
their destination is mostly Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann put forward a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border checks .
the EU @-@ states have so far not been able to agree on common action in the crisis so far .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take up a new resume for a binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee time in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal government in the initial investment and distribution of people more strongly .
the federal government will participate this together with the countries and announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ year consultations with the Prime Minister in the law office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people , protection of fire , be@@ aten this also . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but who@@ ever does not have a chance to stay in Germany could not remain in Germany either .
this idea was sufficiently shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole is now having a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge power of force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of du@@ bi@@ ous refugees are now stuck on the Bal@@ kan@@ route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia in the night .
a few hours after announced the government announced the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary plans to avoid such ti@@ pping trailers over Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new gr@@ en@@ um .
the Romanian government condemned the Plan immediately .
there was first ar@@ rests of people who had inter@@ sec@@ ted the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey there were thousands of immigrants on the road to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the park lies right in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live in their faith over the centuries .
it is in a symbolic way that her tradition of Christian faith in Rome would be appreciated .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the town at that time as a commented .
his negative impressions could lead him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then headed up with his th@@ eses against the las@@ hing andel the division of the Russian church .
hammer Arti@@ sts invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main drives , the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated by Bi@@ bel@@ tex@@ te .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , who now appeared with gorgeous images .
at the beginning , the picture was for Ot@@ mar Alt who has formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is not syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : the respective themes can be customized and can be quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some three years Ot@@ mar Alt who worked at his Bible @-@ project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of All books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these have ar@@ isen following topics such as Kreu@@ zwe@@ g , Pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or pat@@ ernity .
he spontane@@ ously , he has fascinated me several partners : this holds true for the Luther @-@ publishing house with his the@@ ological outlook as well as for the Kettler publishing company with its focus on art books .
and it is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who deal with the painting with the Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible selected by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible and thus into the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
they are embedded between the original Bi@@ bel@@ z@@ itat of Martin Luther and each of the artist , who here put his very personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewel @-@ band has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old thus allows at twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
it is a great sense of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately dependent on the Bible for the Bible : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wern@@ iger@@ ode and grown up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Or@@ den .
&quot; then the education already happened to the pipe , &quot; reminds of Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to stop working , so that perhaps to come back to the Lord father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern be to raise the art of much more significance in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image wel@@ ders is of re@@ clam@@ ation today and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is brought out .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt want to let the spect@@ ator take into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taken &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they let themselves discover , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was founded on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation who has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he understands works with his pictures . &quot;
old have not been taken to grasp the Bible but that is for him important , also mysterious topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explained only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a pictures of the Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work has an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Bilder speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen changes - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15th at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction for BM@@ X @-@ trains nah@@ t
plans made , place found , company applied to mod@@ eled Earth for a course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished .
om@@ issions in politics and administration for an@@ archy , especially among the inhabitants who did not toler@@ ate the train .
so hill from the top , new place were looking for - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the permit will enter in October , could inform the first church in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck at the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then be started without a &quot; further memorial &quot; with the work in former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga will take a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football re@@ acts to the viable position in Germany and as@@ sures the policy of his assistance in addressing the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for each individual to get this topic under the control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the law office and meet the Chancellor , Mrs O@@ zo@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a central role in the issue that he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and wants to assist .
but the decisive ordination has to place the policy .
the German soccer team therefore has its refugee @-@ initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to the four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said K@@ ren@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some federal states support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ eine draws a clear signal , if they are on the left tri@@ b@@ um@@ bs instead of the otherwise usual sponsor of sponsor@@ ship ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make sure that all should help , where and how it can only be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lever@@ cust@@ ody Sport@@ chef Rudi Fi@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee @-@ drama is every one of everyone who must not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use the Bundes@@ liga team , no , we must use our full power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly late , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hoff@@ enheim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter W@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EM qualifications against Hungary on this Friday invites the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Saale
K@@ id@@ s@@ bach proved the support of refugees as &quot; a great common work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ ences would have started to have their own projects in their places , be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as magnificent , small and smallest clubs are active . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent will be spent in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association represents a total of 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees between the DF@@ B and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP e@@ quest@@ s loses an eye in the event of an accident
the board of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports by a fall in early July the left eye has lost .
during the accident at the stair@@ way in the House of his brother in the USA he fell to midnight on a water glasses he held in the left hand , the &quot; Economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost wast@@ ed , was impot@@ ent , then turned out tow@@ ed onto the street - so he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ founders of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could not succ@@ um@@ b to his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the supervis@@ ory meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully handic@@ apped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) , he will come back to Germany in October and lead to the software group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I stood in a regular contact with the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; SZ . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t often comm@@ uted between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you like it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides sk@@ ir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ter@@ te se an ent@@ enced photo and explained , he suffered the injury while he was short@@ ened by the wheel .
he therefore comes with in@@ separ@@ able in Singapore on the weekend as little as a reservation for the two St@@ am@@ mp@@ il@@ ename Fernando Al@@ onso and J@@ ens@@ on Button , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europe League will take definitive .
the national player becomes the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga also in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 . / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday .
if re@@ us on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ game against Leverkusen , will be back again , the BV@@ B coach did open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will change its stem status not only on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the Tor@@ que position .
therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ er takes the place by Chief ke@@ eper Roman B√ºr@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; the football teacher the World Champion .
whether or in the future in all the European league games , Tu@@ chel left the future be open .
with a high probability , he will also be the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ dable statement by Mit@@ players re@@ us that the Fin@@ als for the BV@@ B in the European League will be the target &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l stands for trac@@ eable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to lead the edge to Germany
Germany shall be fron@@ trun@@ ner after the government &apos;s will for change in the car of cars .
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ y@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier from the Haus of Verkehr@@ sm@@ in@@ ister Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which sees amongst other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Dobr@@ ind@@ t spoke in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less st@@ amping , said Dobr@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states which also come together with representatives of the industry on the I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ ic Ministry of Transport is empha@@ sized among other things the importance of the mobile Broad@@ band coating and a growing rate of digital audio @-@ funk .
the testing of new technology is currently being created a test route on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability costs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to employ around internationally , that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ performing cars of 10 to 130 hours @-@ hour was raised .
the Federal Government also wants to use the Vienna Convention for a change of the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees the human being as a driver .
when automated driving takes over , the car takes the guidance , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras which grasp the environment and process the data within seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a study conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , Pol@@ automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically feasible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , vehicles safer to be expected on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added value in the driver &apos;s driver systems and the ultra @-@ automated driving functions at the site of Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clar@@ ified , but clearly defined .
yet , the German self @-@ driving cars still look sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
one on Wednesday at the AA presented survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Test for@@ gan@@ isation Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent at all do not believe in it , 31 percent in general do not believe in it .
in France 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 were awarded autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case the motor@@ ists in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom branch , only seven percent would agree to aband@@ on the control during the entire trip on all the streets .
on the fre@@ eway , the traffic could be expected in flowing traffic nevertheless 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
anyone interested in the car would not leave the control under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - und Doppel@@ beg@@ at Tis@@ cht@@ ennis @-@ EM
the D√ºssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to stand behind the title of the title of September 25 to October 4 only in the single session .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a great loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough , even without having to fetch the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the trainer J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ head during the EM @-@ school@@ ing in D√ºsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by this time , B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term for sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is going to come back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are now no longer such a clear Favor@@ ite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Uni@@ or Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ listing in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ statt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Timo was missing , and we are Europ@@ am@@ eister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this way , we should be guided , &quot; explained the world @-@ fifth .
the English soccer player , Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has moved to a serious injury on the right foot .
at the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the def@@ enders was taken by a Tac@@ kling by H√©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of great fashion show and a w@@ ax@@ in Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , that are sc@@ ary thanks to Video@@ proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who became the great star of the Mo@@ des@@ ene , among others - and that he put men into skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant and the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have a white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be easy , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk &apos; ( V@@ om side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from the 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle der HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ √∂@@ pfer made his early attitude toward a show that his person has changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was about it , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me sound@@ ed an exhibition a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal , Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Die@@ deren .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into that &apos;s barely over @-@ looking factory of the man , who has written the fashion history without ever doing an education .
chron@@ ological is the show not structured , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed total artwork , which was done much effort in order to fres@@ her the d@@ olls , became an example of a sty@@ list .
14 tons of material have made the movers according to data of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the October Revolution was still a special dro@@ w@@ ool : a le@@ ather@@ hood out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gaul@@ tier &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ish mo@@ ch ov@@ ens of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
playing with a d@@ oll , his parents would not allowed him .
the fix@@ ing of fashion did he then come back later on .
he plays fashion journals and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich excit@@ edly .
but later I bought it out of course .
for his first own mo@@ den@@ schau , he did not pay the model .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they allowed the pl@@ ot@@ tos .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ ter - Pl@@ ush tip as a fashion @-@ niche
previously it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ y machinery in and around pl@@ ums therefore to make metres .
the best @-@ embro@@ ider@@ y fabrics and points were produced in large quantities for clients , for example they re@@ worked on ceil@@ ings and sheer curtains .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ isan B@@ auen .
instead , the fashion is again important .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze played a bigger role , then it was pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : head in jewelry , for accessories such as hand@@ bags and on regional tractors .
at all , the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ fashion , which bor@@ row@@ ed itself to past bul@@ ge , an increasing order for damage .
those who are not using any niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer the market .
with us , they already do the half of all orders .
fashion jewellery is together with nine other companies a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they may have the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last 15 years about 80 percent of the sales were cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
private specialty shops and the wholes@@ aler are almost no longer there .
the customer can hardly reach our customer in this way .
the mass goods I become much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively exp@@ elled on chains .
furthermore , de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating of export , currently to Russia and to the USA .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association tries to score points with environmental awareness as Cord@@ ula Bauer of the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
Th@@ eb@@ designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the snow @-@ eberger of the West@@ s@@ √§chs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty for Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and verti@@ ces .
in order to counter@@ pose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and factories that have to think economically and economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design often becomes only slightly vari@@ ated to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , the textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter the historic snow @-@ head .
here the machine sends out a few places to be small kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ e@@ de@@ mayor in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ cke was inspired by it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was able to do nothing with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball for their jewelry .
in an elaborate method , they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to clients , their ancestors in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who would like to have a reminder of remember@@ ing .
this is how I see a jewellery as a modern amb@@ assador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; -@@ film
legends do not want to touch , but Disney still fails to create a new film of his &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not about a re @-@ fil@@ ing but a kind of continuation , the 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double mer@@ cury in de@@ pl@@ omas
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large car@@ v@@ ings and consumers with a significantly higher dose of nerve fi@@ b@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who pre@@ dict@@ ate a proportion@@ ate work@@ man@@ ship of the EU , crit@@ ici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ side effects were passed on with full power and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by Food@@ watch .
in Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the border values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or sword @-@ fish , are raised by one to two milli@@ grams of Mercury , the k@@ ilo@@ grams of fish .
great car@@ ni@@ fish , however , have already been so heavily stra@@ ined with mer@@ cury , that in the basis of the prev@@ ailing border values , about 50 per cent of the recordings are not sold .
after dou@@ bling of the border values then only 14.@@ 5 percent are un@@ negoti@@ able .
in return for this de@@ mar@@ cation , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limits on other fish@@ ings in other fish@@ ings ranging from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram Mercury per k@@ ilo@@ grams .
Food@@ watch did not consider this as a &quot; trick &quot; because of some smaller gra@@ ves , such as car@@ p usually s@@ √©@@ ed so low that they already hold the planned high@@ s already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ab@@ sen@@ ing in Kl@@ einf@@ isch was therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des distr@@ actions that only helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is one of the most highly @-@ toxic gra@@ v@@ all that is heavily an@@ gled across the food chain , above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the German government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; already small quantities are especially given in the un@@ born damage of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Germany declar@@ es on its homepage with regard to current limits , but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not expected to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is carried out above all through coal hydr@@ ation into the environment .
according to the German coal power stations , according to a written information of the Federal Environment Ministry , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of Mercury in the year , two thirds of the total of Germany em@@ itted total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of Mercury in fish approximately in El@@ be , the Rhine and the Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; durable and covering &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel quot@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings have already been war@@ nings from mer@@ cury in fish already to the common common health risks in the EU War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
