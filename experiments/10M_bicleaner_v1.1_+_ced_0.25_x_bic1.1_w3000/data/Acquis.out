the purpose of this part of the Convention is to be specified in implementing the Pro@@ s I concerning securing measures as required .
the aim of the securing measures in this Convention is the tim@@ ely discovery of the distribut@@ ing significant amounts of nuclear weapons for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear fis@@ si@@ bles for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent by the risk of premature discovery .
for the opening of the target in article 28 , the material preser@@ vation is used as a securing of fundamental importance , associated with the spatial installation and the observation as important supplem@@ ental measures .
the technical conclusion of the examination by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material zones , which is not listed for a specific period of accuracy , indicating accuracy limits for the specified line .
in implementing their checking , the organization performs 3 full use of the community &apos;s f@@ use system .
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this agreement is based on a breakdown in material zones .
in use of its securing measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use and , as far as required , precau@@ tionary measures are determined , and practical services are :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , lost or in other ways from the continu@@ ance of the core material and of the stock levels ;
B ) evalu@@ ating re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) Pro@@ cedure and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ;
e ) Proce@@ dures for ass@@ essments are non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which is responsible for each material zone zones and the changes in this order , including the one - and outputs of the material zones ;
g ) Pre@@ vent@@ ing to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are implemented correctly ;

the hed@@ ging measures after this Convention do not extend to material in the mining or the arch@@ ers .
B ) Ur@@ ane - or th@@ ori@@ ent material that has not yet been reached under the letter c ) described in the states , the community &apos;s community shares the amount and composition of the material as if it is not introduced to specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) the core material , which is suitable according to composition and purity of the material manufacturing , or the process of is@@ ot@@ op@@ en@@ coding , the plant or the process phase , in which it is manufactured , or is the core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear waste produced produced in the states , so it is subject to the other in this Convention securing measures .
a ) In this Convention , the requirements for core materials must be termin@@ ated in Article 11 of the requirements , the community is , however , that the recovery of the core material that is subject to the Convention will not be possible or desired , so consult the organization and fellowship one of the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The securing measures in this Convention will be subject to core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 if the organization and community must recognize that this core material is practically non @-@ retro@@ active .
on the basis of the community , the organization exemp@@ ts the following core material from the securing measures in this agreement :
a ) particular fis@@ si@@ le material used in grams - or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;

between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the other hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation )
in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ING NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER reasons - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the conference for international economic cooperation with low income , to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , to help meet their development due to general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States , that the entire member of the Member States has been bound by force within six months , as far as possible in the form of loans , and the organization will do its potential to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the organisation have consul@@ ted each other via the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the medium binding to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution in the context of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC has submitted a table created in the EEC , in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; special transaction , &quot; which will help the Member States in accordance with the special transaction account ; this account will be implemented by the organization as Administrator @-@ handed , and only to which this agreement is established and according to the provisions of this agreement .
the special account will be separately , separately , separated from all other accounts and assets .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment will be in the form of cash or non @-@ ins@@ ulations to the Member State , which is entitled to pay in the local currency of the organization as Administrator of special transaction and to deposit the organization in the country in question .
B ) Payment is in two rates , and indeed i ) the first in height of at least 45 v . h . within 30 days of entry into force this agreement or to another between the EEC and the Administrator agreed ;
II ) the second amount of the resi@@ dency of the accession to 1 January 1979 , or another time , which was agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans required .
C ) Every member state can afford the payments prior to the above schedule .
the car@@ et@@ aker takes according to the usual method of organization , roughly proportional drawing dies to cash or school@@ ing to cover the expenses for the special notes and the special en@@ acting account in a reasonable way .
when ensuring this loan , the car@@ et@@ akers can be led by the following factors in accordance with the EEC &apos;s conditions :
III ) the scope of which the international economic factors contributed to the current and fore@@ se@@ eable economic problems in the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the trend of the country &apos;s debt reduction and its additional credit capacity to loan conditions ; and
VII ) the extent that the problems of the country in question is given by contributions from other sources .
each of its special loans , the financing of a clear and fast @-@ paid development program or pre@@ hab@@ itation ( including a sec@@ toral predi@@ sposition ) , does not matter whether it is allocated to the organization and practices , which is approved and ad@@ ministr@@ ated , whereby , under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement , the aim of the addition is considered to be considered .
the resources of the special transaction must not be used instead of the average means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has been bound for a programme or project that has been approved by the Bank or Organisation &apos;s directive on the day of the in@@ vigor@@ ating of this agreement .
aside from section 4 , special notes of loans are subject to the same amount of redemption , which granted marketing loans generally accepted by the organization , and they are therefore pay@@ able in ten years each in 50 years .
special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts to the payment of this dial @-@ watch is directly to the organization that they re@@ tains .
any special note loan is provided by a separate loan agreements between the recipi@@ ents and the Administrator , in which the origin is stated .
the income from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient state or for goods or services ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and according to the rule of what the manager could be granted at the time of loan granted to the recipient of a special transaction .
capital out@@ flow of special tax loans are carried out on the special tax account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state paid back to its entry as soon as possible by the manager to the Member State .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches up to the full payment of all special regulations on the EEC concerning the audit in preparation and on the directors approved by directors and programs .
during the period of the special transaction , the manager of the EEC instructed the EEC into the development of the special notes of loans and loans .
the manager transmitted the EEC as soon as possible , according to the conclusion of the organization &apos;s financial year , an exhaus@@ tive billing statement with an opinion from the organisation of the organization to this account .
based on the special payout of the special transaction , the manager of the EEC as soon as possible , transmit a detailed report on the projects financed by the Special Action Plan and Sche@@ dule .
the manager is created and leads to suitable records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction , made from the account funds will be derived from the accounts recei@@ pts from the accounts pay@@ ed from the accounts and pay@@ outs on the Member States .
the EEC and the Administrator work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the Administrator to the complete edition of the special transaction accounts for the time of the special transaction accounts , the progression of the programmes , or projects , and to all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
this agreement is on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , agreed to the EEC and the organization , if necessary , the agreement and all forms of resulting obligations are due to immediate effect .
if the entire capital amounts all of the recipi@@ ents accepted , according to Article II Section 8 of this agreement , rep@@ aid to the Member States , thus this agreement and all the obligations ar@@ ising from the parties concluded with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as defined according to the legal regulations of each party .
governments of the Member States rules the general Secretary @-@ General of the Council of the European Communities .
the Secret@@ ariat informed these noti@@ fications along with a notification via the ord@@ n@@ ical approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organization .

agreement in the form of a letter between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements ( International Economic Community ) and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements ( Member States ) in the context of the mid @-@ term financial advisory board
the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if banks submit an appropriate application .
the agreement could be closed down to the amount paid by the credi@@ tor in the mechanism of paid contributions , and within a total number of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion invoice units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future upgra@@ des from member countries .
however , however , some conditions are mentioned below , to whose application the BIS would be ready .
in every Stand@@ by credit , the BIS would initially take over a commitment for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without being exceeded five years .
when opening of loans , as well as at the extension extension , the BIS would calculate a loan opening vision .
in addition , the first draw was agreed on the end of a month after the termination of the Stand@@ by agreement , the Bank can make the necessary adjustments of its own liqui@@ dity .
the drawing would occur in the BIS at the conclusion of the agreement to be made available , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to time periods that were taking into account the means of the Bank , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who change the BIS at the time to under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market positions .
if the BIS has to pro@@ cure the necessary resources themselves on the market , the maximum interest rate could be reached , which equ@@ ates to an appropriate margin increased .
I would be grateful if you would give me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if banks submit an appropriate application .

a reag@@ ent to blood type determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the tigen containing the antibody , or any other on the label stated substance hom@@ olo@@ g .
if a reag@@ ent is used in the manufacturer recommended , the following factors or appearances are not allowed : a ) ha@@ em@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the title is measured twice in a suitable medium through ever @-@ repeated refin@@ ement .
the title is the numer@@ ical value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by the volume of blood flow in the overall volume .
anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents , which are to be used on object dreams , the activity is expressed by the time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has specified for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group assignment International standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity are being dra@@ fted to the time standards .
an international standard preparation includes according to definition a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents to blood type determination of most speci@@ alities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational cells , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution at a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te drop@@ ping .
the ti@@ tre gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mixture within a series to which a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination , for the International standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in the basis of the title of unknown reag@@ ent in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren gives you 256 @-@ units per ml .
the preparations are available for free from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Serum Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative title of international standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A @-@ reag@@ ent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the recommended conditions , the required properties should remain at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a reproduction , according to the label , is a maximum one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the expi@@ ration date on the exp@@ iry date for dry reag@@ ents is aimed at the results of the expi@@ ration tests ; it is appro@@ ve from state regulatory authorities .
drying reag@@ ents are stored in an atmosphere of domestic gas or in a vacuum , and in the glass container , in which they have been dried and that is so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ acted may not lose a maximum of 0.5 l / h of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor@@ ites at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg to 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the competent authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or associated with the drying of the solv@@ ents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiot@@ ic , provided with the added substance further the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin of blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml .
reag@@ ents , whether in superf@@ ine form or after re@@ jection , must be transparent and must not contain any se@@ di@@ ments or visible particles .
for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents to blood @-@ group determination , the should not be arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally coloured , at least until the International Convention on a uniform system has come .
reag@@ ents to blood type determination are found in such ways and distributed in such quantities , that this is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount must be so big , that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer @-@ Lab has all production levels and checks of reag@@ ents to issue blood @-@ group typ@@ ing .
adequate samples of all selected reag@@ ents are so long to store , until some probability may be accepted that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ents of reag@@ ents can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective percentage , and others represent the necessary tools to rein@@ force effectiveness and preser@@ vation of the re@@ ag@@ ility .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents contain no substances of human origin .
each single container is a black and white printed label printed in English and French . the following data contains : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , amounts to the amount and composition of the necessary liquid ,

protocol on the 1979 Convention on wide @-@ scale lim@@ iting air pollution concerning com@@ b@@ ating emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or its lim@@ iting river
concerned about the current emission of air @-@ contaminated substances in exp@@ on@@ ated parts of Europe and North America damage to natural importance of vital importance to environment and economy ,
in fact that the Executive Board has approved the need for the Convention on its second session the need to take effect on the annual general emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des from ort@@ uring @-@ firm and movements to 1995 , as well as the need that states that have already made progress in reducing its emissions to nitrogen oxi@@ des and check their emission limits for nitrogen oxi@@ des .
taking into account of existing science and technical data on emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their subsequent products on the environment , as well as data on technologies to combat emissions ,
determined to take effective measures to fight and reduce annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or its lim@@ iting river , especially through application of suitable national emission limits for new mot@@ ion@@ alised solid sources , as well as retro@@ fitting existing sources of fixed sources ,
