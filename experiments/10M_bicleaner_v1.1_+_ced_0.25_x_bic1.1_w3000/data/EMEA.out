this document is a summary of the European Public Library Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) , described in detail in order to proceed to recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
if you need further information on your disease or their treatment , please read the package line ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you want more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ less thinking and talking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a psych@@ ic illness , in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal noise ) altern@@ ates with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of medium to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al troubles if the oral ing@@ es@@ tion of medication is not possible .
in both cases the solution can be used to capture or the melting tablets in patients who prepar@@ es the swal@@ lowing of tablets .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adapted to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is thought to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter has to activate the recept@@ ors .
da d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder plays a role to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus avoiding psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and it will be prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the symptoms occur in three studies , up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection @-@ solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ ze , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which were to prevent re @-@ occur in 160 patients , where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection @-@ solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest , with which compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients on the basis of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment .
the company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to determine ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with injection @-@ solution patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms are increased un@@ rest than patients who received a placebo .
in use for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was beneficial in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms as placebo .
in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented one of 74 weeks working in more effective than placebo in case of treated man@@ ic episodes with previously treated patients and when it was additionally given to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , headache ( trem@@ or ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , loss hyper@@ activity ( increased storage ) , fatigue , fatigue ( loss of s@@ ali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) arrived at the end that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from mid @-@ severe to severe inci@@ dents in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole asked to transfer risks .
in addition , the committee on the result came that the advantages of injection practices in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . , a approval to the public transport of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is responsible for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day even daily with meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated , although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mono@@ therapies or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y &apos;s efficacy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
a lower initial dose should be considered with regard to greater sensitivity of these patients ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction can be removed from combination therapy , the arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the onset of a anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidemic of epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder did not have increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with an@@ ben@@ zene in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ be@@ z@@ ole should be treated with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , hyper@@ conduc@@ tive disorders ) , cereb@@ ral vas@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ utes for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ d@@ ration , treatment with blood pressure @-@ related medicines ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which one year or less , there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis .
if the symptoms of an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients with signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis should be dra@@ gged to reduce the dose or inter@@ rupt the treatment .
if a patient is developing signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns or un@@ clear high fever without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be reset .
Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole should therefore be applied to patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at sur@@ fac@@ tions , which are related to the sei@@ z@@ ure of sei@@ zu@@ res .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole in patients suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients who were treated with the Alzheimer &apos;s disease , an elevated risk of death compared to placebo .
there were however , in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to un@@ wanted cereb@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no exact risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should regularly be monitored regularly regarding the wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as side effect is known , and may lead to serious complications .
based on the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole to the central nervous system , caution is provided when Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alised drugs with recur@@ ring side effects like sea@@ weed ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rate of arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased its AU@@ C by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ s can result in higher plasma imaging to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ di@@ zed metabolism .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential health benefits should over@@ weigh the potential risks of the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ mit@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV protein , might have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age at the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
the dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ological morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if she become pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ ole .
due to in@@ adequate data to safety during humans and due to the concerns in reproductive trials , this medic@@ inal product may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , like other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against it , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to service , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole did not have a negative impact .
the following effects occurred more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than on placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total lower incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ osa were compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under os@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was suffering from patients under ter@@ i@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under semi @-@ i@@ dol treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS decreased to 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % were treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole and placebo which were potentially clin@@ ically controlled changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and sei@@ zu@@ res , un@@ wanted cereb@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular events and increased mortality rates in older dementia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute hyper@@ do@@ si@@ z@@ ations were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and observed without death .
although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an overdose with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ tic@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment is a high plasma binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial diagonal effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a diagonal effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2 and D3 receptor and an in@@ ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ al and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
with a gift of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day more than 2 weeks on healthy subjects showed a dos@@ ing @-@ depend@@ ant reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , an D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ ti@@ us and at Put@@ ting .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole found a statistically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a week 52 the proportion of patients who were enrolled in a semi @-@ random@@ ized study included a response to study medication related to both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales defined as secondary courses , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg - Depres@@ ant Sc@@ ale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % of placebo .
in an os@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , 3@@ 14 patients included in significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies with a flexible dose over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole displayed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy study more than 3 weeks with a fibro@@ sis of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ be@@ z@@ ole found no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies more than 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ op@@ i@@ dol in week 12 .
in the week Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole also proved a comparable proportion of people with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie on such as Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which do not part in lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy , yiel@@ ding a superior efficacy comparable to the reduction of mono@@ z@@ ole compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase of more than 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ ole compared to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly on prevention of a bi@@ polar return .
based on in vitro @-@ studies , enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ d@@ ration and hydro@@ xy@@ z@@ ole and the N @-@ deadline is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average elim@@ ination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ ites over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and with approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor , &quot; metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study did not have sexually dependent effects .
a pop@@ al @-@ specific evaluation on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics gave no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in respect of eth@@ nic@@ ity or the effect of smoking at the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ ium @-@ ben@@ zene and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study involving subjects with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic and dehy@@ d@@ ration of the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which does not suff@@ ice to draw shots on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity , and toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and can@@ o@@ gene@@ ous potential , the clinical data had no particular dangers for human beings .
Tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions which have exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of people , so they only have a limited or no meaning for the clinical use .
the effects re@@ recorded a dos@@ is@@ depend@@ ant side rin@@ gement and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell exposure ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the recommended maximum dose while humans ) and an increase of minor symptoms of 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the medium Ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when people ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ xi@@ asis developed as a result of the colon@@ ization of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ ites from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ ple of the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ ole did not know more than 6 % of the concentrations that were found in the study of over 39 weeks in the G@@ all of Mon@@ keys , and lie well below the limits ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical level dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial diagonal effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a diagonal effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an os@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , 3@@ 14 patients included in significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy treatment over 3 weeks with a fibro@@ sis of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ be@@ z@@ ole found no superior efficacy against placebo .

in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical level dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injec@@ tion@@ solution is applied for rapid control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ ors in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole injection should be termin@@ ated and the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole will be started .
to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deeply in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under the disper@@ sion of ob@@ ese regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) depends on individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine used already for the maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a secondary treatment with arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y processed tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IP@@ Y solution .
there are no research on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole injection practices in patients with aging and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ inen in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole @-@ solution is considered necessary , the patients should be observed in respect of extreme periods or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .

Ari@@ pi@@ be@@ z@@ ole should be treated with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , hyper@@ conduc@@ tive disorders ) , cereb@@ ral vas@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ utes for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ d@@ ration , treatment with blood pressure @-@ related medicines ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which one year or less , there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should regularly be monitored regularly regarding the wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as side effect is known or a healthy life @-@ guide and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ an was compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole , in a study , in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was administered intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and the same time was intra@@ muscular at the same time ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rate of arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common use of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 to CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma levels of arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ mit@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age at the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the Sed@@ an was greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects occurred more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole injection ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than amongst placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side @-@ listed side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant effects in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS decreased to 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ a z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % were treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole and placebo which were potentially clin@@ ically controlled changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al troubles was the Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole injec@@ tions with statistically significant significant improvements in as@@ tig@@ ation / behavior associated with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and as@@ pi@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al ab@@ norm@@ alities , the arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole injection practices was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding the irrit@@ ability and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the average improvement from the bas@@ eline value on P@@ AN@@ SS excitement Compon@@ ent scores in the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe as@@ gi@@ bility , a similar effectiveness in relation to the total population was observed , but statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) compared to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a week 52 the proportion of patients who contributed to study medication was similar in two groups ( Ari@@ ad@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales defined as secondary courses , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depression @-@ Sc@@ ale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below placebo .
in an os@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , 3@@ 14 patients included in significantly less patients with an increased weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
111 . in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which do not part in lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy , yiel@@ ding a superior efficacy in reduction of micro@@ algae in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted more than 26 weeks , followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole , Ari@@ pi@@ be@@ z@@ ole found themselves superior to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly on prevention of a return in the Man@@ ia .
the arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two ejac@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma pi@@ ds within 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated treatment in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on re@@ produc@@ t@@ x@@ iz@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after maternal ex@@ position , 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) lay over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity , toxic@@ ity and can@@ o@@ gene@@ ous potential , the clinical data had no particular dangers for human beings .
Tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions which have exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of people , so they only have a limited or no meaning for the clinical use .
the effects re@@ recorded a dos@@ is@@ depend@@ ant tri@@ axial pig@@ ment ( or / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cells ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 @-@ 10 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to 10 times the medium @-@ level state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when people ) .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study that participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , three quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mono@@ otherapy ) was compared with the traditional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medication ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicine .
consider only the people who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , in terms of efficacy , disease and survival in relation to the deteri@@ oration of the disease .
however , in patients who had previously received other treatments their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicine .
it must also not be used in patients , feeding or before the onset of low neut@@ rop@@ hel@@ pers in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been more effective in patients whose first treatment was not more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicine and that it must not be given unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines in other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission told the company Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited a approval to the office of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients whose first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is not beaten and not shown for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ rop@@ enia , &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 is the treatment to inter@@ rupt until an improvement is reached by degrees 1 or 2 , and after all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tions in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there are no studies involving patients suffering from imp@@ air@@ ment function and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to in@@ sufficient data to un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ ar@@ ming form@@ ul@@ ating from pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could significantly have other pharmac@@ ological features than other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be drained and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be in@@ stituted , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients , no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ rop@@ enia rose again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased again &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clear@@ est with Abra@@ x@@ ane was not demonstrated in the context of carcin@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardiac inci@@ dental inci@@ dental inci@@ dental patients are not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or ru@@ in heart disease or lung disease .
in case of the patients with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rhoea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ an@@ e@@ tics and conden@@ sing funds .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or at female age , which do not practice an effective conception , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ changeable .
during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane should apply a reliable prevention method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is advised , during and up to six months after the treatment no child to bear witness .
male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sperm ar@@ isation , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane consists the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very common ) and dizziness ( frequently ) , which can effect on the traffic jams and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse reactions that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III clinical trial .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking major hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ sh@@ en@@ ie was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , side effects are listed that occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mono@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .

as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no cog@@ nitive connection with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ bacterial inhibit@@ or that stimul@@ ates the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules of the tubes of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing of its dep@@ oly@@ sis .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ k@@ rot@@ u@@ bul@@ ular Network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cellular functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ gen@@ osis of plasma components in the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in @-@ vitro studies have been demonstrated that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transportation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ ess transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ receptor will be medi@@ ated and given a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in c@@ yst@@ eine in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two randomised controlled studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was administered in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mono@@ therap@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an adverse state of general ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ as@@ els .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and duration of progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are laid down below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived in a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 during the therapy .
the natural development of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for sound cutting on Bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of abra@@ sives with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the drug ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 . after intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma was adopted in multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 , and the high distribution volume has an extended ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or turn@@ tables of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane was compared with the values after a 3 hour injec@@ tions of 175 mg / m2 of solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance by pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher according to the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift ( 43 % ) than after a solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is first formed in the first line to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and too two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value of cum@@ ulative carcin@@ ogens was 4 % of the total full dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .

it is used in patients with normal blood sugar levels in which in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if before the procedure is not possible , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ amed neg@@ ativity must be conducted under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases that is shown to the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make up an own blood @-@ sp@@ ill , de@@ vol@@ amed into a v@@ ein is inj@@ amed .
injection can also be made by the patient or its support , provided they have received reasonable guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency and in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ations should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ite in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / d@@ L in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to control to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron stores should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby , that the body is not enough on the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
Ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss .

all in all of this study , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before they were inj@@ ected either to ab@@ ro@@ amed or still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study before , in which the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been studied at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study , patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ al values of patients who were treated to ab@@ se@@ amed were submitted to the same degree as in those who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients who continue to have received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / d@@ L of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ L .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure which may occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , severe headache and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
im@@ pe@@ amed as injec@@ tions under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are necessary to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) reported that the medicine was established according to the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / l ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation ranged between 9.5 and 11 g / l ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
an@@ u@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease load ; therefore ass@@ essing the individual clinical assessment and disease prevention is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins increased by more than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
because of the vari@@ ability between patients may occasionally be observed in patients with individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ations above or using the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ ari@@ ability it should be tried by a corresponding dose management , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / d@@ L ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / d@@ ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation value increases by more than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the long @-@ term hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ bin@@ er is 12 g / d@@ L ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ic@@ ine al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored eng@@ m@@ esh@@ y to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ u@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initially low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / d@@ L or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may possibly require higher maintenance doses for patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / d@@ L or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initially low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may possibly require higher maintenance doses ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
initial dose 50 i.e. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 i.e. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in steps at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ u@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and - following reports may vary depending on age , gender and total disease load ; therefore ass@@ essing the individual clinical waste and disease prevention is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ ari@@ ability it should be tried by a corresponding dose management , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / d@@ L ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / d@@ ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be monitored eng@@ m@@ esh@@ y to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa is in the lowest permitted dose , which is necessary for control of an@@ u@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ a value at least 1 g / d@@ L ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the recur@@ ring number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl from the initial value , the dose should be maintained from 150 i.e. / kg three times a week or 450 kg / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the recur@@ ring number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl has increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 i.e. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 HP / kg ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the recur@@ rent cy@@ ten@@ se increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl , the dose should be maintained from 300 i.e. / kg three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ bin@@ ation around &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the recur@@ ring number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , a response to ep@@ ox@@ y @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely to be abor@@ ted .
patients with slight an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre @-@ sto@@ oping storage of ≥ 4 blood co@@ ils is necessary should receive se@@ amed at a dose of 600 i.e. / kg of body@@ weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the onset of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood sp@@ inning programs - will be available at the beginning of the ab@@ ul@@ amed treatment of large iron reserves .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 HP / kg ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) .

if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / d@@ L ( 8,1 m@@ mol / l ) must be adjusted to minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ al events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ i@@ an@@ emia - Dos@@ is@@ adaptation with the goal to keep the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ge between 10 g / d@@ L and 12 g / d@@ L ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit of risk provision@@ ing in particular patients who should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for an extra charged or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure , if possible , before the beginning of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated correspon@@ d@@ ingly .
patients who underwent an adequate hem@@ or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an elevated risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiac disease .
in addition , treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa can not be excluded , for patients with an initial loan value of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l. a increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ al / vas@@ cular events .
in several controlled trials , ep@@ ox@@ ins did not prove that cancer patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia would improve the overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour cells .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy alone when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / d@@ L ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mol / l ) was targeted
ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be insp@@ ected and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be adjusted to increasing ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in @-@ vitro tests on tumor we@@ bs are no indications of an interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .

the most common side effect during the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ic .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .

survival and tumor studies were examined in five major studies involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these trials were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study , there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin patients and the controls .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treated patients with an an@@ a@@ emia due to various more common malign@@ an@@ cies , consistent , statistically significantly higher mortality rates than with controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin patients and controls satisfactory .
there is an elevated risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour @-@ patient who can be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded .
it is not clari@@ fied how far these results will be treated in the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ine in tumour patients with the aim to transfer a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value under 13 g / d@@ L , as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed half @-@ life time of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly pro@@ longed period of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels , which are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .

if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ op@@ en@@ ie , it will break up your treatment with se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given through injection in a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels , and the risk of death could be increased .
in increased or infectious potassium , your doctor may consider a dis@@ ruption of treatment with se@@ amed amed up until the potassium values lie back in the normal range .
if you are suffering from chronic ren@@ al kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ mirror will not exceed a certain value .
according to present , the detection of blood is not accelerated with chronic ren@@ al failure in adults with chronic ren@@ al failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ) , which are not accelerated the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a sickness that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and women .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( broken bones ) , including patients who have recently suffered a s@@ trau@@ matic hip break down like that ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone , a disease that has altered the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injec@@ tions into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) , shortly after the application of acet@@ sta , can reduce the symptoms of symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain , and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the rating of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis was involved , and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study involved 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in total 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with a ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood was norm@@ alized or reduced by at least 75 % compared to the initial figure .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis drugs ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients with ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures were reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hips , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 by 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are often less frequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta can not be used in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or one of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patient is subject to risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion or oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is ( Ab@@ die from bone tissue ) in the ja@@ w .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors who use ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the similar material for patients who discuss the side effects of the drug in which the drug may apply to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission approved the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Europ@@ ress Limited with permission to bring Ac@@ la@@ sta in the European Union .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic th@@ ru@@ c@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with ac@@ la@@ sta , a long running time was observed in patients that responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advis@@ able to ensure patient with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the prevalence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ sta , can be reduced through the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen short after the application of acet@@ sta .
patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for these patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data are missing to un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( 35 ml / min ) , because the patient population has only limited clinical experiences .
at the beginning of the treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta , hypo@@ kal@@ emia due to sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid impact of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic effect on bone structure a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypoth@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advis@@ able to ensure patient with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be detected prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental surgery with adequate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental access , there are no data available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the or@@ tho@@ l range .
the clinical evaluation by the treatment doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk evaluation .
the prevalence of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of acet@@ sta , can be reduced through the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the prevalence of as serious adverse reactions were in patients who received ac@@ la@@ sta , increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , overall incidence of pre @-@ hoped between ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted medicine effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function in oste@@ opor@@ osis in three years were comparable between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to placebo over 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of lab ass@@ aul@@ ts , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic values ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently reported envelope , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a Initi@@ al dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ or , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the or@@ tho@@ l ) reports that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic , were treated .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after Z@@ ah@@ nex@@ tra@@ ctions or other dental offices .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients re@@ appeared oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ros@@ is in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ or with one with placebo and a placebo treated with placebo .
in the case of overdose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be reached by a gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) efficacy and safety of ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density filter or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the scissors @-@ h@@ eter ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing peg body .
effects on morph@@ ometric @-@ body frac@@ tures ac@@ la@@ sta significantly increased over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and over had a reduced risk of cancer patients compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures ac@@ la@@ sta demonstrated an equally lasting impact on three years that resulted in a reduced risk of reduction in hips in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hips , and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly compared to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , the total hips at 6.0 % , a volume of 5,1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients who were treated with acet@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , were taken from the pel@@ vic spon@@ ge after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es .
a micro@@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis demonstrated with ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to placebo an increase in the tra@@ operative bone volume and preser@@ ving the tra@@ operative bone architecture .
bone sales mar@@ ker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were measured in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output level after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not tested by rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality rate was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the overall th@@ igh and sh@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as at all time points .
Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the overall th@@ igh and by 4.3 % on the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as .
clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized , 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures amounted to 7.5 % in ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of ac@@ la@@ sta was once referred to the percentage of weekly gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in comparison to the percentage of the Len@@ den@@ verteb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ D within 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ ist Ac@@ la@@ sta was investigated in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with the radi@@ ologically clear Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper standard value in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
after 6 months of combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain relief was observed compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified by the end of the six month main study as Respon@@ sive ( on the therapy ) could be recorded in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was compared with 71 of the patients treated with the risk of frac@@ tures , in the middle period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multi@@ ples 5 and 15 minutes per@@ sever@@ ed in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which has proved dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma level decreased rapidly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0,1 % of the value .
fast bi@@ ph@@ oric van@@ ishing from the large circulation system with half hours of ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ x 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ s@@ wer@@ emade to ½ g of 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) represent the rapid absorption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tions on the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the full body @-@ Clear@@ ance is ir@@ respective of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race , or body@@ weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in the cili@@ ary concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma cent@@ ration of time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is not metab@@ oli@@ zed - and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this emerg@@ es that a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function up to 35 ml / min does not require dos@@ ing adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
for severe kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only restricted dates are possible , no statements are possible for this population .
acute Tox@@ ic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg of body@@ weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
studies in dogs have single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the recommended number of human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al mod@@ ulation .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of zinc deficiency in 3 @-@ day intervals , tot@@ aling 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose containing about the 6@@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure ( equivalent to 7@@ 500 mg / kg ) administered in intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose representing the 7@@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , relative to AU@@ C , corresponds to ) , well toler@@ ated .
in long @-@ term studies with accumulated depreciation , which exceeded the maximum of the intended Human @-@ exposure , the toxic@@ ological effects of other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most common command and studies involving repeated application was a prolifer@@ ative primary ad@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a command , which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of substance .
in rats a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity observed from 0.2 mg / kg as an external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
ocular effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the maternal toxic@@ ity was expressed in 0.1 mg / kg due to the lowest serum @-@ calcium @-@ mirror .
if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the preparation and the conditions before application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is a representative of a sub @-@ class that is called Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
decl@@ ining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass that is observed in men .
when Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure too fast , and new bone material is un@@ ordered , which makes bone material we@@ aker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alized the bone structure as it ensures normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone again .
if you are subject to dental treatment or under@@ go any dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other drugs please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the care staff if you use other medicines / apply or previously taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know whether you use drugs , of which it is known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta , together with food and beverages , you are concerned that , according to your physician &apos;s instructions , you can take enough liquid during the treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nur@@ ses as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hips , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or nur@@ ses as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since ac@@ la@@ sta operates for a long time , you will eventually require a further dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions to follow the calcium mirror in your blood in the time after in@@ fusion does not become too low .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can function for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
when the administration is missing from Ac@@ la@@ sta , please contact your doctor immediately with your doctor or hospital to make an appointment .
before termination of the treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta if you consider the ending of treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta , please visit your next doctor &apos;s min , and discuss this with your doctor .
adverse events related to the first in@@ fusion occurs very often ( more than 30 % of patients ) , after the subsequent in@@ fusion , however less frequently .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle pain or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently , it is un@@ clear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes these irregular heartbeat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you get ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs due to low calcium concentration in blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps , or cra@@ w@@ ler feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or in the ja@@ w were reported mainly in patients who were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
an allergic reactions , including more rarely cases of respiratory problems , rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , the tongue , or in the throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or care personnel if one of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or notice effects that are not listed in this manual information .
if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture is recommended to increase the in@@ fusion of acet@@ yl two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be supplied sufficiently with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid impact of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advis@@ able to ensure patient with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended in the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

A@@ CO@@ MP@@ L@@ IA is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients ( body mass index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or are overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or several .
in addition , four trials were carried out on more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ CO@@ MP@@ L@@ IA was used compared to placebo as a supp@@ or@@ tive agent .
however , to assess the space , however , there are no uniform results , so the effect of A@@ CO@@ MP@@ L@@ IA was severely affected on this application area .
what risk is associated with A@@ CO@@ MP@@ L@@ IA ? the most common side effects of A@@ CO@@ MP@@ L@@ IA , which were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory problems . the full list of adverse events related to A@@ CO@@ MP@@ L@@ IA reported side effects .

the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse reactions in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who were treated to weight loss and due to companion diseases .
if the incidence was statistically significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for un@@ wanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undes@@ i@@ rable effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng By response side effects , the following common problems are being laid :

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Library Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) , described in detail in order to proceed to recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It cannot be applied solely ( mono@@ therapies ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a drug @-@ medicine ) is not shown .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be satisfactory in the highest possible dose alone in the highest possible dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ material or insulin it can maintain the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl species ( low blood sugar ) in the beginning , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fon@@ dness and insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be enhanced and the blood sugar level decreases , which means that type 2 diabetes is better .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl species , in addition , they received up to 3.5 years either with either account or placebo .
in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value to conclude that blood glucose levels were reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the addition of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl was revealed in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a lowering of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin had been examined in 289 patients , the patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin measures yiel@@ ding a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took additional placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were bl@@ ur@@ red vision , infections of upper respiratory tract infections ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients who are probably excessive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ on@@ levels - infant levels - in blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos would serve as part of a mono@@ otherapy ( in sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to join Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ appropriate for contra@@ indications of contra@@ indications ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. past heart inf@@ ar@@ ction or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) are endangered , a de@@ com@@ po@@ ised heart failure should begin to begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in combination with insulin is used .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in relation to heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror is increased to 3 times the normal range of the normal range , the liver enzy@@ mic values are as soon as possible .
if a patient is developing symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , th@@ oph@@ thal@@ ate , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark Har@@ n , are to check the liver enzy@@ mic values .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the end of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dos@@ is@@ depend@@ ant weight gain was detected , which can stir from fatty deposits and connected in some cases with a liquid equation .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ az@@ one decreased slightly ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative studies involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ atology ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensi@@ tivity in patients who received Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral dual @-@ combination therapy or triple combination therapy with insulin @-@ combination therapy or as a two @-@ way combination therapy , the risk of dos@@ is@@ depend@@ ant hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
following the market launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ genes , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported on an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the taking of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but mis@@ erable doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients are reported about disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages undes@@ i@@ rable events concerning bone @-@ bro@@ och@@ es from randomised , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TIV@@ E study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) which were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient desire a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment is decre@@ asing ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of the interaction have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one do not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions of medicines that are metab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ spec@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces the hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ or and the re@@ frac@@ tive index of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents occurred over three times the standard range from the norm range frequently to placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ u@@ rous liquid .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease the frequency of a severe cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency was 1.6 % higher than in placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or less .
since the market launch , rarely about cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency was reported under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , more frequently when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure was applied in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
it was a summar@@ izing analysis of undes@@ i@@ red events regarding broken pieces of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with sp@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medications .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TIV@@ E study , frac@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day after seven days had no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activ@@ ating specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an elevated insulin sensi@@ tivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ze as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the period up to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
after two years after the beginning of the treatment , blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ icide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite three @-@ month optim@@ isation phase with insulin in@@ sufficient , too pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients who continued to only received insulin ; a reduction of insulin delivery in which was treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group was observed .
in clinical trials over a year there was a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inine quot@@ as compared to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was evaluated in a small , 18 @-@ week investigation on type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel , as well as minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the overall plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .

in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved the post @-@ den@@ dial tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this is also an effect on tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption than also on the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TIV@@ E study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease were random@@ ized in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years , in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is re@@ absorbed quickly , with top concentrations of the un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma , usually 2 hours after application will be reached .
based on this basis , M @-@ IV &apos;s contribution to the effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ action studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral application of radioactive mark@@ eters Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans , markers became mainly found in f@@ ences ( 55 % ) and found at a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination period of the un@@ changeable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plas@@ modi@@ fying concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with restricted kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance is similar to the breast .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and ap@@ es , after repeated administration of plasma enlargement with hem@@ at@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces the hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was performed in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as is not able to produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is not capable of using the insulin .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which indicated that blood sugar levels were similar to a different human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who possibly react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can lead to blood sugar ( the full list is the package line too ) .
the Human@@ itarian Relief Sub@@ stances Committee ( CH@@ MP ) announced that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane declined in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S as approval for the public transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day , when a quick initial effect is requested together with a longer lasting effect .

patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning system can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ onic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or delivery method ( due to combin@@ ant DNA versus Insul@@ in animal origin ) may result in a change the dosage is needed .
if the upgrade to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is necessary in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients whose hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal cell in human insulin , reported that the early warning of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia was less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin .
before travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to bring the advice of his doctor , as such travels can lead to treat insulin and meals to other times or taken .
therefore , the doctor must take into account possible inter@@ actions in the therapy and will always consult his patients after other drugs .

however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated by oral treatment of glucose and glucose food .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape varieties , sweets , cookies or sugar fruit juice in themselves . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with loss of consciousness are treated with a intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid , or by glucose that is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum capacity is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire operation time is up to 24 hours .

this document is a summary of the European Public Library Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) , described in detail in order to proceed to recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
the arz@@ t@@ ally effective component in Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is manufactured using the process of so @-@ called re@@ combin@@ ant technology :

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who are probably hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may have to be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S as approval for the public transport of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin has to be re@@ ared , then the amount of the long @-@ acting insulin .
3 if the upgrade to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d is necessary in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to bring the advice of his doctor , as such travels can lead to treat insulin and meals to other times or taken .
5 general diseases and complaints at the administration place Gel@@ eg@@ in@@ ally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction on the injection site during the insulin therapy may occur local hyper@@ sensitivity actions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape varieties , sweets , cookies or sugar fruit juice in themselves . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with loss of consciousness are treated with a intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid , or by glucose that is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical attempt at an intensive care unit for treating hypertension ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mol / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent greater surgical procedures ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mol / l ) reduced mortality rate of 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum capacity is reached within 1.5 @-@ 3.5 hours and the entire operation time is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was examined at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already shown signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or notes of gi@@ raffe ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater judgments , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the u@@ cle@@ ation furnace after two to four weeks is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ on@@ ite , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months the treatment can still occur . it is therefore recommended that patients have at least taken during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic also another drug for the prevention of poison cases .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , at which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of various Aden@@ ur@@ ic do@@ si@@ des ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine ( a different drug to the treatment of hyper@@ pri@@ z@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ wh@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine was used 300 mg once a day . patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose body @-@ acid seal was below 6 mg / d@@ L during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients receiving the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily had an u@@ rea demand in the blood of less than 6 mg / d@@ L .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no one of 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , in patients with cardiovascular problems , an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) arrived at the end that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ wh@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ op@@ ha@@ emia in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one of the medical history known or present at present no@@ ds of sick and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum @-@ acid sequence of 2 @-@ 4 weeks still remains &gt; 6 mg / d@@ L ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase may be considered to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , the effectiveness and safety were not fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and teenagers Since there are no experience with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents Since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with chronic heart disease or de@@ com@@ promis@@ sed heart failure , the treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as in other har@@ vest@@ ing medicines it can occur during treatment in case of acute inf@@ ar@@ ction because of the lowering of the serum @-@ resp@@ i@@ ration , u@@ rea deposits initially can be mobili@@ zed in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine passed so far in rare cases that it comes to an expi@@ ration in the urine .
liver disease During the phase 3 clinical trials were observed from the liver function in the patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended , before beginning of Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ es@@ treatment and further course , depending on the clinical trials and test the liver function ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was did not run in@@ effici@@ ents to Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhi@@ bit can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( an inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .
for subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated 250 mg 2 times daily with a rise of Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ec@@ ex@@ position ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors were not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or the other active ingredient is required .
in a study involving subjects treated 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily , an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak @-@ scale effect of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , contains the recording of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( about 1 hour ) , and a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , however , has no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies do not allow for side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect imp@@ lications for pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when using a vehicle that can be careful when working in exercise or exercise , until it may be reas@@ onably safe , that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC did not influence their performance .
a paid higher incidence of the test reported cardiovascular disease was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine group in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0,7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found , and no significant correlation with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors for these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ clerosis disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at and the test ( test evaluation ) might be reported in total more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rhoea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials have been observed no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions .
7 Open @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies have been treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment un@@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment groups a total of more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients suffering from hyper@@ op@@ ha@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy point in each study was the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly serum concentration of &lt; 6.0 mg / d@@ L ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) were observed in each study .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serving incre@@ dul@@ ent value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ L and ≤ 2.0 mg / d@@ L .
the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority for reducing the serum levels below 6 mg / d@@ L ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) for a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ wh@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority for the permanent lowering of the serum levels below 6 mg / d@@ L ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ wh@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ en@@ circles &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / d@@ L ) or 300 mg 1 x per day ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were conden@@ sed for analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of the serum levels at &lt; 6.0 mg / d@@ L ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during a doctor visit in week 2 and kept permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ en@@ circles &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / d@@ L received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al dys@@ functions The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with ren@@ al operational restriction ( d. h ) .
the primary efficacy point with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was 45 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clinical significant differences in terms of the percentage of ren@@ al concentrations in patients , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ ly concentrations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( including bas@@ eline ) had an serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the long @-@ term lowering of the serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / d@@ L ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) revealed a decrease in incidence of tox@@ ins in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out feed ) .
this was associated with a reduction of gyp@@ sy size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete van@@ ishing of plaster of notes by month 24 .
increased tow@@ ed values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma cent@@ re@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plas@@ ma@@ on@@ ate Time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is easier and multi@@ pl@@ eted doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at doses of 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simpler or multi@@ pl@@ ural doses of 80 and 120 mg of 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5,0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clinical significant change in the percentage decrease in the serum concentration was observed , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent st@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at lies in the range of 29 to 75 l , after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma integration of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is about the concentration @-@ width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg , constant .
in vitro @-@ studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are primarily formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is primarily created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C mark@@ up Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in the urine passed as un@@ altered Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 3 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion on the urine , about 45 % of the dose found in the chair as un@@ altered Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 12 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient group ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency : after taking multiple sclerosis doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or serious kidney @-@ in@@ suff@@ iciency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bone is bro@@ od@@ ly ) in women after men@@ opause , in which there is a risk for low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or use of other drugs ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lay down until after the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 is already separated from each other in drugs which are approved in the European Union , the company presented data that come from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to reflect the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at income ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data that the al@@ im@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , corresponding to the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive apparatus such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive problems ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cers , diar@@ rhoea ( stomach problems ) , upset stomach .
in patients with acet@@ ate hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be used .
it must not be applied to diseases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who are not at least 30 minutes long standing or sitting .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or taking drugs ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following references are to be precise to reduce the risk for ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or the tablet in the mouth since a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • These patients should not take place before taking the tablet before at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients who dis@@ car@@ ded a kidney or liver to prevent transplan@@ ting transplan@@ ted organ from the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Progra@@ mmer / Progra@@ mmer is already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from the previously implemented studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial of 6@@ 68 patients with ren@@ al transplan@@ tation was presented , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ is was compared .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was kicked off after a year ( by example , examined how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were performed and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body .
Tre@@ mor ( trem@@ or ) , headache , nausea / vomiting , diar@@ rhoea ( diar@@ rhoea ) , kidney problems , higher blood sugar ( hypertension ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and insom@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with acet@@ ate hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , mac@@ id antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be used in Adv@@ agra@@ f .
patients and physicians have to be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f , since the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of at the same time should be adapted accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ dised yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule ground with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with the immune disease therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients , this drug should be ordered or changes in the immune disease .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or to an elevated incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or auto@@ immune disease .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; re@@ visions of formulation or regim@@ es should only be done under tight control of one in the transplan@@ tation experienced physician ( see section 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tions must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains maintained .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ ence and toler@@ ability in the individual case and based on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommend@@ ations )
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks of conversion .
at Day 4 , the systemic exposure was measured as a level mirror , both with both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspec@@ tions of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels are recommended throughout the first two weeks after gra@@ fts using Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate effect phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first post @-@ operative phase , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment may be administered intraven@@ ously ( progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application to supp@@ ression the transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; consequently , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression must not be specified ; consequently , a maximum length of oral therapy may not be specified .
dose for kidney disease - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft @-@ absor@@ bing gra@@ ven therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift of the morning .
further dose adap@@ tions may be required later , as the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ ising the patients after the transplan@@ tation .
dos@@ ing recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft transplan@@ tation of gra@@ ft regim@@ ents should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift of the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from progra@@ f at Adv@@ agra@@ f needs to be converted into a daily intake of progra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , this change@@ over has to take place at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After a conversion of other immun@@ os@@ supp@@ res@@ sy to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with each one in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must begin recommended initi@@ ation for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions .
heart transplan@@ t For adult patients who are turned on Adv@@ agra@@ f is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day at once in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recei@@ vers , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f , pancre@@ as and dar@@ mented patients , occurred at an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 10 mg / kg / day and in an oral test dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for use .
dose adap@@ tions in special patient groups Pati@@ ents with restricted liver function on maintaining blood tal@@ es in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function has no effect on the pharmaceutical ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dose adap@@ tion is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ en@@ cir@@ at@@ in@@ insp@@ iegel , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring body volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ agra@@ f with the change@@ over of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is careful ( see section 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the Tal@@ mud levels in full @-@ blood The dose should be based on clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ ence and toler@@ ability in the individual case under activation of full @-@ blood tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels .
it is recommended frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low @-@ levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after switching by Progra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adaptation , changes to immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ster therapy or with simultaneous use of substances which could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations can require several days , until the Ste@@ ady State entered .
the data in clinical trials make sure that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level levels will not be exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the tac@@ ular mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time following liver transplan@@ tations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and m@@ ashed patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recei@@ vers were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft reactions or other side effects , which can occur in a consequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or excessive exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; re@@ visions of formulation or regim@@ es should only be done under tight control of one in the transplan@@ tation experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft reactions , which has been proven to other immun@@ os@@ yn@@ res@@ sources , are not yet clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions in adult cardiac transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipi@@ ents are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a lowering of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements may include , or other plant extracts during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to severe fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , as a program as kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e denom@@ inated , which can therefore also be found under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid exposure and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va , exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to suitable clothing or use of sun protection by suitable clothing or using a solar protection factor with a high degree of protection .
if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us symptoms such as headache , different consciousness levels , sei@@ zu@@ res and bl@@ ur@@ red vision should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
because Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ant , lact@@ ose contain , is careful in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lact@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption Special caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medic@@ inal products , which are known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reducing blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore advis@@ able to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels when they can change CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism to monitor and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain appropriate concentration ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the rise of blood levels mainly from the elevated oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal disorders , resulting .
highly dosed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one as it is used in acute abor@@ tion operations , the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or lower blood concentration .

because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us put down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ tiv@@ a and thus raising the hormone ex@@ position to take action particularly cau@@ tious regarding recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us could reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a low number of studies on transplan@@ t@@ ational patients do not provide evidence that the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compar@@ es an elevated risk of adverse events regarding the course and outcome of the pregnancy .

L@@ ung@@ ing transplan@@ tation In a preliminary analysis of a recent programme conducted via a recent programme was reported about 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 @-@ Rand@@ om@@ ani@@ zation .
chronic transplan@@ tation , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis was obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome , was observed in the first year after the transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year amounted to 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients increased in 21.@@ 7 % of cases to the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis in comparison to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ is had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were accompanied by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ ine ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases where there was no acute gra@@ ft reactions occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) for the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group greater ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis was obl@@ iter@@ ated - syn@@ dro@@ ms treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients significantly lower .

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ ate value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ born faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates for transplan@@ tation after transplan@@ tation .
this allows to conclude that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metab@@ oli@@ zed by the ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly made via the bile .
for stable patients receiving programme ( once daily ) at Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was less than 10 % lower than under programme .
it is recommended frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .

advances will be used for treating and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII ) .
dosage and frequency of the application are addressed afterwards , if Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles , or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method , referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was emp@@ tied to the formation of the human fac@@ ulty factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a drug approved by others in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is otherwise made that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new hem@@ or@@ char@@ ds were honoured with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against the human cl@@ ots factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission approved the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG a approval for the public transport of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage : dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitu@@ ent therapy act after the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ Man@@ gel , after the place and the extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the norm , or in i.e. , / d@@ L ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during treatment , a reasonable dose and frequency of injec@@ tions becomes an adequate provision of the factor VIII @-@ plasma concentration .
individual patients can differ in response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different sem@@ esters .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not achieved , or if the bleeding is not controlled by a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to verify in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values it is possible that the VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be exhausted .
the intake rate should be set after the patient &apos;s desire , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complications of patients suffering from ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position days is the biggest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 Ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , according to switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product , was observed in a different re@@ combination of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the incidence of A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all previously untreated patients who have increased risk of education of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of each patient ( 234 ) calculated . ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ ative day ) in a patient under contin@@ ual A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation was maintained during the whole time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in plasma and Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE an 145 children and adults 2 with severe heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient following 26 ex@@ position passages with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was determined by prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in the previously untreated patients a current clinical trial were 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the response of patients on the tracks of contaminated protein was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend than also a persistent peak of antibodies against anti @-@ Cho cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms caused by an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients have been isolated from the occurr@@ ence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased numbers of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ lo@@ tes during several repeated product positions in the context of the study .

this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified , that a gene can carry into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has been altered so that there is no copies of themselves and therefore no infections can trigger in man .
Adv@@ ex@@ in should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from non @-@ def@@ ec@@ tives in the human body of the p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to recovery damage DNA and kill the cells , when the DNA can &apos;t be restored .
by Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein works no right , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the field of sub@@ structure , in bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the answers of the company on the questions , some questions were still un@@ explained .
based on the initial documentation , the CH@@ MP is created on Day 120 a list of questions sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors bring benefits to patients .
the Committee further concerns concerns concerning the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ant@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in in contact with the patient , harmful .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP to know whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently interested in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ oc@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered drug @-@ release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so con@@ formed that one of the effective components immediately and the other is slowly released for a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is applied to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , nas@@ al inflammation of the nas@@ al infections ) in patients with nas@@ al skin sli@@ pping ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents 12 years the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as brief as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al nerve ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medication can be ref@@ using to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main fe@@ asi@@ bility measurements were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms , which were reported from patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in viewing of all hay fever symptoms , including con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients receiving the symptoms reported by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rine alone .
when only the swelling of the nose was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze had a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % compared to the patients who are des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( cardiac activity ) , oral drying , dizziness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( loss of appetite ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , P@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components against ad@@ ren@@ al active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( high blood pressure ) , blood or vas@@ cular diseases including hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ self ) or already a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a cereb@@ ral blood stroke ) or have a risk for a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted a approval to the SP Europe company approval for the public transport of Aer@@ in@@ aze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to dis@@ assemble or ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the failure of data to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after losing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as at long @-@ term application the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rin can take hold of time .
after passing the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es into the upper breathing , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rine contains , the medicine is also counter @-@ indicated in patients who treated with a mono@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after ending this treatment .
this is attributable to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ ine such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ i@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ id , Lis@@ bon@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ struction , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , hydro@@ haz@@ olin , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data are not enough to en@@ roll the recommendations to the dosage .
safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze have been tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and do not submit the data to en@@ roll the recommendations to the dosage .
patients must be informed about that treatment in occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ or , or cor@@ rup@@ tions , heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of the head@@ aches ) must be removed .
the treatment of the following patient groups is advised to be careful : • Pati@@ ents with heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes mell@@ itus , brass kn@@ ap@@ construction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours before performing the mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or can reduce in their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes in the plasma cent@@ ration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and those who were treated with placebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzyme has not yet been identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs could not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medic@@ inal CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the un@@ question@@ able of the application of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , yet experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies caused no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to normal population .
since Re@@ productive studies on animals can not always be transmitted to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ ic properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rin , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to any imp@@ air@@ ment of the transportation , or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular @-@ circulation ) and a CN@@ S stimul@@ ation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ ading , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ree .
headache , anxiety , severe mi@@ stress , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tensions , Eu@@ phr@@ ates , ar@@ ous@@ al , breathing in@@ suff@@ iciency , heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nausea , vomiting , corro@@ sive pain , dizziness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
an CN@@ S stimul@@ ation is particularly likely in children as well as at@@ roph@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pup@@ il rigid and di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the hibition of release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stur@@ b@@ cells / bases as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the expression of the adh@@ es@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ nit@@ ine on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in one single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables , including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are associated with the flies .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily has no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further lik@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
in total , 1,@@ 248 patients participated in the age between 12 and 78 years of seasonal rhin@@ itis . 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets were received .
in both studies the hist@@ amine @-@ agon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined using the total score for the symptoms ( except nose syndrome s@@ well@@ ung ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in regard to the well@@ being effect , determined based on the nas@@ al skin sli@@ pping , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in regards to gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of one single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is present within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers above 14 days the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and P@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rin was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ automotive study , which was performed with formulation of healthy adult subjects , found that four subjects des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was badly affected .
a Compon@@ ent Inter@@ action study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rine resulting from the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rine was the exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , for toxic@@ ity in re@@ manufacturing , to gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and to reproductive ox@@ ic@@ ity , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin don &apos;t recognise any special dangers for human beings .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than their individual components , and the adverse effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive @-@ related studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / P@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rine was not imp@@ lied with a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 the prescribed pharmac@@ ovi@@ g@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the alle@@ vi@@ ation of allergic symptoms by preventing that hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , can produce its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets lin@@ ens symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever ) such as Ni@@ esen , running or ju@@ ck@@ ling nose and drink or che@@ ering eyes at the same time con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous drug p@@ seu@@ do@@ ed@@ rin , which is included in this product .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ osi@@ tive gast@@ ric ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer ) , a clas@@ p of stomach upset or of the twelve ( gut closing ) , a snake bite , bron@@ ch@@ ase in the patient &apos;s history ( breathing not due to a var@@ ic@@ ose of lung muscular ) , a prostate si@@ fication , or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
please inform your doctor if you are diagnosed or diagnosed with Aer@@ in@@ aze on the following symptoms or diseases : • hypertension • Herz@@ l , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as • nausea and headache , or rein@@ forcement of existing head@@ aches .
when taking Aer@@ in@@ aze with other drugs please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you take other medicines or recently taken if it is not prescription drugs .
traffic importance and operation of machines For use in the recommended dosage is not to calculate that aer@@ ob@@ serving leads to drow@@ sin@@ ess or dis@@ rup@@ ting attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze than you should be aware of your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you should have taken a bigger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ aze if you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the time at present time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or notice effects that are not listed in this manual information .
heart hunt , rest@@ lessness , dizziness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood glucose levels , thirst , ti@@ redness , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness , and drow@@ sin@@ ess .

according to the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , very rare about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing need , whi@@ st@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , rash and swelling ) or skin suggestions .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunt , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach problems , diarrhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , dizziness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , ra@@ ind@@ lessness , sei@@ zu@@ res , loss of liver infection and more cases of con@@ sp@@ icious liver disease was also very rare reported .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ esh and 5 m@@ g. of melting tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml si@@ syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml @-@ solution .
for children aged up to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml si@@ r@@ ens or r@@ ens .
for children aged from six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml si@@ r@@ ens or r@@ ens .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance in days ) and after six weeks of treatment was obtained .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup , the solution to use and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are un@@ think@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us were considered an average decrease of symp@@ tom onset ( symptoms point ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decline of symptoms after six weeks treatment was 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be applied to patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted a approval to the company SP Europe issued a approval for the public transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents aged from 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done in accordance with the previous disease , and can be resum@@ ed after the end of the symptoms and re @-@ occur .
in per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended throughout the patient period .
clin@@ ically important inter@@ actions were not found in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study NSC 631570 is not enhanced when taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol consumed the effective effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to any imp@@ air@@ ment of the transportation , or the ability to serve machines .
clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most frequently recorded side effects , which was reported more often than in placebo was drow@@ sin@@ ess ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect headache , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multiple dose study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the hibition of release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stur@@ b@@ cells / bases as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the expression of the adh@@ es@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in the context of a clinical study involving multiple outlets that was administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in an individual dos@@ ing study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables , including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are associated with the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ sts and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and persistent , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be classified in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces that caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investig@@ ating for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology considers the underlying path@@ ology in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recruited .
since the hist@@ amine @-@ release is an estimated factor in all ancient diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also expected in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidance .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interv@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of the Jewish population by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ance , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , which were comparable in patients with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved .
there are no measurement points for clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzyme has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medic@@ inal CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty foods , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) does not depend on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were performed on a comparable degree from the exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , not qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in re@@ produc@@ t@@ x@@ iz@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has no particular dangers for human beings .
coloured film ( includes lact@@ ose @-@ Mon@@ oh@@ y@@ dra@@ t , Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indig@@ oc@@ ar@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( includes Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax .
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is present to support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
besides the exclusion of upper breathing lessons or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es should play a role in the diagnosis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests .
approximately 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years of metabolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are limited and experienced a higher yield point ( see under Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us syrup in children aged between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted by metabolic , is identical to children who are normally metab@@ oli@@ zed .
this medic@@ inal product contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a suc@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suff@@ iciency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically important inter@@ actions were not found in the context of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study NSC 631570 is not enhanced when taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol to increase the effective effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us syrup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multiple @-@ one study involving adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old , who came to an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1,25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
since the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study involving multiple outlets in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of clinical dose ) has been applied for more than ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents do not have increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
for an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were performed in clinical trials for adults and adolescents in clinical trials .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol has not increased in increased performance of alcohol in an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess stress .
in adults and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis were A@@ eri@@ us tablets effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ sts and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effectively reduced by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interv@@ alls .
the prevalence of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were identified in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ specific dose study with the syrup forms of children aged between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially distributed to the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has accepted his request for the prevention of A@@ fl@@ y@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ era of H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ y@@ ov should be used in adults and older men to protect flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that might cause a strain of influenza virus that might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out if a new strain of influenza virus emerg@@ es , which can be easily spread from human beings , because humans still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to form a rapid antibody in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as body @-@ foreign ) , was cleansed , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this allows the scope of clinical data base to assess the safety of the vaccine , in order to comply with the requirements of the EMEA region vaccines requirements .
if you participate in clinical examination and require further information on your treatment , please contact your treatments doctor .
if you want more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution to the use , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the security of this combination has not been investigated .
A@@ gener@@ a should then be prescribed when the doctor tested , which anti@@ viral drugs of the patient had previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has indicated that the virus is approached on the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral drugs .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ is@@ ase is designed after body@@ weight .
chor@@ us reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines . it maintains a low level .
AIDS is not able to cure , however , the damage of the immune system , thus developing the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ a was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r , studied in two basic studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah .
in 206 adults , with low dog@@ sted ritual increased medic@@ inal products , had been compared with other prot@@ e@@ wear inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ e@@ inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ously , more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than to placebo , but A@@ gener@@ a was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , but with the children who had been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , very few were said in the treatment .
in the study involving adults , who had previously been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , the viral load increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ wear inhibit@@ ors , there came under A@@ gener@@ a to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks as in the patients who continued their existing prot@@ ru@@ in inhibit@@ or :
the most common side effects of a@@ is@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhoea ( diarrhea ) , diar@@ rhoea ( bladder ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be applied in patients , which may be excessive ( allergic ) against amp@@ b@@ abo@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ a must also not be applied in patients , the cur@@ k@@ raut ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are min@@ ed as ali@@ ases , and in high concentrations in the blood are harmful .
as with other medicines against HIV in patients who take A@@ gener@@ a , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is ( symptoms of a infection that are caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end indicates that the advantages of ag@@ glomer@@ ates used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier p@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of a@@ gener@@ a in combination with k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer , is not demonstrated .
A@@ gener@@ a was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since the approval of scientific reasons only posted limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to approval for the public transport of A@@ gener@@ a across the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ alized is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer ( PI ) , treated adults and children from 4 years of age .
for usually , A@@ lev@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting with low doses of k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral load type and pre @-@ treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended adult dose is 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ lev@@ ase capsules are applied without the enh@@ ancing addition of k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of chor@@ us ( 1200 mg twice a day ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ pr@@ ase capsules is 20@@ mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ er@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ors were not examined in children .
as@@ gener@@ a is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to failure of data to un@@ think@@ able and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ pr@@ ase capsules in adult patients with middle @-@ he@@ avi@@ est liver function has to be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions at 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use of patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder with caution carried out in patients with severe liver function disorder is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width , and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma levels and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r during the taking of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to the cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with a@@ gener@@ a , does not prevent risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ pr@@ ase capsules are supposed to be used together with low doses of k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk of severe liver canc@@ elling with potentially fatal course .
for the case of an anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show a higher frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ generic and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of treatment the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the C@@ ushing function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin depends heavily by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of ag@@ ast@@ atin with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ oly@@ sis including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective for decreased plasma levels ( see section 4.5 ) .
based on the possibility of metabolic drug inter@@ actions with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of interaction .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ racy symptoms , especially if there are still low doses taken from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of a toxic@@ ity of a toxic@@ ity of the A@@ gener@@ a solution , this intest@@ ine form is con@@ tra @-@ indicated for children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution with certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ a should be set to about 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer , has been reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an external type of diabetes mell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , to which therapy medication were necessary , associated with the development of diabetes mell@@ itus , or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and metabolic disorders associated with metabolic disorders .
in h@@ ind@@ oph@@ ile patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , reports are about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous h@@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and ha@@ em@@ bos@@ ses .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defective may cause an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) to develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resistant opport@@ un@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ rea , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) reported .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of a@@ is@@ ase must not be given at the same time using medicines which have a low therapeutic latitude , and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic latitude of a@@ is@@ c@@ r must not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly exchanged via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and combined with increased plasma concentration with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
in an attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plasma concentration by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently desired effects on the liver have been observed .
St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taken in the cur@@ ry , the am@@ ot@@ av@@ al mirror , and , if possible , examine the vir@@ us@@ load and add the cur@@ rant .
a dose adap@@ table for one of the drugs is not necessary , when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see also E@@ ames below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r were used twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , which prove the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ able of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower if Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r daily ) was given .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in plasma , which were obtained at the combination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r is administered twice a day .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but there will be a close @-@ m@@ esh@@ ed monitoring , because the effectiveness and in@@ convenience of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ o in combination with di@@ dan@@ o in combination , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ o , is recommended that revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and a@@ gener@@ ously lie down at least one hour ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
for this reason , in combination with an ear@@ drop in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ sten@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both protein @-@ inhibit@@ or would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine may decrease the serum concentration of Am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r .
if this drug should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced / possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma concentration .
if this drug is used together , caution is necessary ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance is to be done as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous interpre@@ ting of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in the plasma cent@@ ration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus resulted in an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ d@@ us@@ tin .
if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is required along with a@@ is@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is advised , although no clinical data is required .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with bladder in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma concentration of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg / k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma to 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 5m ) to 2,@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ b@@ abo@@ r with k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can result in common with A@@ gener@@ ously , possibly causing inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with chor@@ us .
based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da not be taken at the same time as a@@ is@@ ase since it can come to res@@ or@@ atory disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ va that are known as enzyme oils ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , can lead to a dis@@ advantage of the plasma concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ d@@ pin , ni@@ d@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ d@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased as 10 by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug .
con@@ current consumption of chor@@ us may increase the plasma levels considerably and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) increased significantly during 7 days . endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by around 86 % ( 90 % account interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , together with this glu@@ co@@ her@@ ald together with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ ids , it is not recommended that the possible benefit of treating a risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is pronounced as the result of the plasma concentration of ag@@ glomer@@ ates .
da Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ds increases the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duction @-@ inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is not recommended .
it is recommended for common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations as up to stabili@@ zation of mirror , because the plasma cent@@ rations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased when it can be increased from Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ a must not be used together with oral cor@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time application of a@@ gener@@ a is provided with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data regarding the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein extracts indicate a possible rise in plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am about 3 @-@ 4 tor@@ rent .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ racy symptoms , especially if there are still low doses taken from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the lower low reliability of historical publishers , no recommendation can currently be given , such as the Am@@ b@@ av@@ r dose is administered when it is given to meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
in the same grace of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant together with a@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of we@@ aken or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ al effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption is recommended .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( such as Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous interpre@@ tations of A@@ gener@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us in comparison to the possible risks .
in the milk lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r leaves in people into breast milk .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats which was given by the elim@@ ination in the u@@ terus until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight in the post@@ age .
further development of im@@ itation including fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive ability was not affected by the administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in the matern@@ ity .
in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials were studied in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the her@@ nia @-@ associated side effects were mild to moderate , very early , and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether it is used in connection with the pill or any other at the same time to the HIV treatment applied drugs , or whether it is a sequence of the mar@@ ath@@ ering .
most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , which were not treated twice daily with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ently .
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , listed below the study medicine as part of the study medication and were performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well under the treatment of management changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fast li@@ pos@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ vial fat accumulation ( Sti@@ er@@ ooks ) .
of 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral individuals who were treated with h@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a median duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ lt ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study , PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 showed up 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s above a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin rash was usually mild to moderately , ery@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ al nature , with or without it@@ ching and , usually during the second treatment week , and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without having to be abor@@ ted with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defective may cause an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) to develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resistant opport@@ un@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tom@@ atic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm at acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µm at chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans still is not defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r do@@ si@@ z@@ ations were observed , as with other k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r treatments , the mut@@ ations were observed only rarely .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg fossil avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of ritual twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically investigated .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure within the 59 , demonstrated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ently , showed drug patterns , which were similar to those who were with adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study , AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg ) of k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) participated in patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ically predi@@ ct over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer mut@@ ations :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses of the activity of the activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resist@@ ence as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in connection with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with a dimin@@ ished lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mutation patterns can be subject to any additional data , and it is advised to adapt the current interpre@@ tative systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , analyses of clin@@ ically phenomen@@ al interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data on the activity of the activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer prot@@ ector .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpre@@ t results of a resistance tests .
each of these four , with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r associated genetic patterns , produces a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r .
there are currently data on the resistance to cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ b@@ abo@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ement numbers for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ it@@ avi@@ r Resist@@ enz@@ pf@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on the twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients , a drug resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 Isol@@ ate ) .
vice @-@ versa , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ ons re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ wear inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early demo@@ li@@ tion of a scor@@ ching therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which can take effect on the following treatment .
the cover of the effectiveness of ag@@ res@@ ase in combination with k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study in which with PI ( 600 mg twice a day ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ an@@ alogy ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with the lowest Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to a@@ is@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the research study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ sub@@ sist@@ ence of AP@@ V / K@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI Group in relation to the time @-@ adjusted average changes of output value ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ voltage threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the efficacy of un@@ ob@@ oo@@ ised A@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged from 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in studies , A@@ pr@@ ase has been tested three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg of times daily , 20 mg / kg twice a day and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose to be given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ a .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study included plasma @-@ HIV 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with an median increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Based on this data , the therapy optimization should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ob@@ oo@@ ised &quot; A@@ gener@@ a .
according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , for C@@ max is lowered by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) administered together with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
hence the minimum concentrations in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of re@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and allows to close a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r from the blood@@ stream in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pl@@ ot@@ r that remains the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born equ@@ ali@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the open @-@ active ingredient varies depending on the total medication levels in the Ste@@ ady State above the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , pharmac@@ euticals , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must in@@ duce or secre@@ te or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with caution if they are given at the same time using map@@ le ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of generic capsule capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is a solution of 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore , bladder solutions and a@@ is@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the effect of kidney function based on elim@@ ination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely .
these treatments will lead to Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r plasma , comparable to those who are obtained to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in mice and rats arrived in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ at@@ ocy@@ cellular Aden@@ oms with dos@@ ages of 2 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily offering of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ocy@@ cellular Aden@@ oms and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been cleared and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
however , from the present ex@@ position data on humans , both clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , little indications of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial inhibit@@ ing tests ( Am@@ it Test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kern@@ els included in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r nor mut@@ an@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically .
these liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical life through the AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of chor@@ us after the end of treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity at@@ titudes , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both of the controls and with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r animals .
in a systemic plasma position , which was significantly higher ( rats ) or significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage , however , were observed a series of minor changes , including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and low @-@ level skel@@ etal changes , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ lev@@ ase capsules are applied without the enh@@ ancing addition of k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of chor@@ us ( 1200 mg twice a day ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ pr@@ ase capsules is 20@@ mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use of patients with weak or light liver function disorder with caution carried out in patients with severe liver function disorder is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ a should be set to 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and metabolic disorders associated with metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in plasma , which were obtained at the combination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r is administered twice a day .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but there will be a close @-@ m@@ esh@@ ed monitoring , because the effectiveness and in@@ convenience of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ sten@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both protein @-@ inhibit@@ or would be low .
if this drug is used together , caution is necessary ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance is to be done as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is required along with a@@ is@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although no clinical data is required .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ d@@ pin , ni@@ d@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ d@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ ot@@ b@@ ulation , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) increased significantly during 7 days . endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by around 86 % ( 90 % account interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in the same grace of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant together with a@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of we@@ aken or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ al effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ th@@ ind@@ ron plus 1.0 mg cam@@ er@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r by 22 % bz@@ v .
this drug may only be applied for the mother &apos;s possible risks for the mother compared to the possible risks for the mother in comparison to the possible risks .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats which was given by the elim@@ ination in the u@@ terus until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in the body weight in the post@@ age .
in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials were studied in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in the case of overdose the patient is to be observed at signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures can be led .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tom@@ atic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm at acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µm at chronic in@@ ous cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
vice @-@ versa , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ ons re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ wear inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the therapy optimization should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of &quot; un@@ ob@@ oo@@ ised &quot; A@@ gener@@ a .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born equ@@ ali@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the open @-@ active ingredient varies depending on the total medication levels in the Ste@@ ady State above the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , pharmac@@ euticals , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must in@@ duce or secre@@ te or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with caution if they are given at the same time using map@@ le ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney function is likely to be low in the elim@@ ination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ogenic aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been cleared and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
however , from the present ex@@ position data on humans , both clinical trials and therapeutic usage , however , little indications of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .

studies on toxic@@ ity at@@ titudes , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both of the controls and with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r animals .
these results conclude that in young , the metabolism of the metabolism of the metabolism is not yet fully developed , so that Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ a solution to use is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer ( PI ) , treated adults and children from 4 years of age .
the benefits of del@@ ici@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ky &quot; A@@ generic solution was neither affected by PI in the treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the use of the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there is no dose recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a solution to remove and low do@@ si@@ red k@@ ins@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided with these patient groups .
although a dose adap@@ tion is not necessary for Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , use of a generic solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a consequence of high @-@ level propylene content , A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated for infants and children under 4 years of pregnant women , with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration can lead to a peti@@ tive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of this drug , possibly causing severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gener@@ a prevents the risk of 47 transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .

the applic@@ ability and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the treatment of the elderly . • In case of incl@@ ines in the genital region , Al@@ dar@@ a is open three weeks per week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the cream is dou@@ bt@@ ful during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is to be dil@@ uted before bed@@ time on the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficient long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with placebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients treated with full bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated with six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times per week .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with full healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in total 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ os .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • For the treatment of War@@ ning in genital patients , the results of the two studies were treated to bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a total reduction rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to placebo group compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ics , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic Ker@@ at@@ os ( AK@@ s ) on the face or on the scal@@ p of immune competent adults , if size , or the number of les@@ ions are lim@@ iting and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are con@@ tra @-@ indicated or less suitable .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is so long to continue , until all visible plant@@ ations in the genital region or peri@@ odic range disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
inter@@ ruption in the above @-@ described treatment sequence should be considered when intensive local inflammation occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when in the treatment area is an infection .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the les@@ ions were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient applied the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is caught up in a thin layer and rub in the joint , with in@@ clin@@ ically infected skin area until the cream is completely coated .
it should be carried out in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and with a possible contamination of its auto@@ immune disease .
it should be detected in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and with a possible organ output or gra@@ ft versus @-@ host@@ - reaction related risk .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ auth@@ orization has been carried out , two cases of severe Phi@@ mos@@ is and a case with a leading stri@@ k@@ tur was observed .
with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended dos@@ ages , an elevated risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) in rare cases have also been observed under objec@@ tified application severe local skin irrit@@ ation that made a treatment required and / or led to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulty in water that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected division .
for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous funds for the treatment of external hi@@ p@@ ples in the genital area and Peri@@ an@@ al@@ area there are no clinical experiences yet .
limited data indicate an increased rate of flow @-@ reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a smaller effectiveness in this patient group in relation to the removal of the f@@ eig@@ ning measures .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with iri@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair kit was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take back in general during treatment or the reactions form the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of patients or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be done by several days .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after re@@ generation of treated skin around 12 weeks after the end of treatment .
currently , no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months are available after treatment , while super@@ fi@@ ci@@ de bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , other treatments should be taken into consideration .
patients with recur@@ ring and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs are no clinical experience , therefore the application of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors are not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicates that large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or in the Lip area within the Lip Aug@@ ment Area .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os at anatom@@ ic positions outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data about the acute ker@@ at@@ pants on the fore@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this use case , therefore a such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions take usually in the course of intensity or go back after placing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
when local skin reactions cause large dis@@ comfort or are very strong , treatment can be suspended for several days .
an open clinical study shows that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions a lower total healing rate increases as patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cr@@ ème should be applied with caution in patients who received an immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
for animal studies , no direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ ale development , dis@@ integration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although there is no quanti@@ fiable level of quanti@@ fication of quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given to use during the breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and possibly possibly possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in relation to adverse events in the studies with three weekly treatment were local reactions on the place of treatment of f@@ eig@@ ning ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .

the most common , as probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection related side effects were a reaction on the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects that were specified by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream patients with acute ker@@ at@@ pants were listed below .
this placebo @-@ controlled evaluation of clinical evidence shows that in this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials involving I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme frequently come to local skin reactions , including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , Ex@@ cer@@ ation / leaves ( 23 % ) and ö@@ der ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
this according to investig@@ ational clinical evidence shows that in these studies using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme very often lead to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and heavy damage ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the study of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od application for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ pants alo@@ pe@@ zie with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) was found at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dentally unique oral intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically significant side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 m@@ g. was norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 appro@@ vals relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that effectiveness in relation to a full release of the in@@ clin@@ ations in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is superior to placebo over 16 weeks .
in total , 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients with in@@ clin@@ ici@@ ties ; this was 20 % of the 105 ( 95 % CI ) in patients with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete press release could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , versus 5 % of 161 male patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
hist@@ ologically , hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed , which remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od tot@@ aled 3 weeks in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area than on the un@@ hair@@ less scal@@ p or face .
results from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical trial period after one or two treatment periods .
authorised indications of external f@@ eig@@ ning , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ pants and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma occur in pairs of pa@@ edi@@ atric patients usually not checked and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials at children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Con@@ tag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the study evaluated ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks / week ) .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ pants was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ alled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bag ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bag ) .
the calculated sem@@ iconductor period was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ value after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; that points to an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in the age of 6 - 12 years of low and comparable to the healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ pants or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ arian bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal Tox@@ ic@@ ity , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ ations , it is a risk for human exposure because of systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice that was treated with the effective free cream , formerly and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can harm other people even if these same symptoms have been reported as you . − When one of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or notice effects that are not listed in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

in the study , it was investigated mainly the safety of the medicine , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( using its effect in terms of reduction of g@@ ag concentrations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the g@@ ag levels in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children pointed out a normal liver on the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .

the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who have Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , in terms of reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. permit a permit to transfer Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms to the European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Cho @-@ Mamm@@ oth cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , derived from the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzymes in patients with secured diagnostics of a Mu@@ ammar ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient contributes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion reactions that are defined as any correlation between the side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , specifically , these patients should also be monitored eng@@ m@@ esh@@ y , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ ational installations are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the Phase 3 clinical study , virtually all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase represent , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction need to be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery after a longer inter@@ ruption , it must be cau@@ tious because of the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after a dis@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the inc@@ fusion of medications with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ lock ) to minim@@ ize the potential adverse reactions .
in the case of a slight or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ol and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen would be sc@@ aled and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are caused to decrease the anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ol and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen treatment .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect imp@@ lications for pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated across the breast milk over breast milk , is recommended to not breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the effects in clinical trials were classified mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and their extension of a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently performed in the following table after the following stand@@ ings : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts and lungs in history were also severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , breathing and facial expressions ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly serious injuries and treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table .

in most patients , it occurred within 3 months after the onset of treatment for a server version , whereby it occurred in the patients at the age of 5 years with severe distor@@ tion form mostly within a month compared to a server version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) 13 / 45 patients were not prov@@ able to have been identified by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ repar@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay , including 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ ia .
patients with lack of low antibody @-@ levels showed a robust reduction in g@@ ag levels in the har@@ n while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of g@@ ag in the har@@ n was observed .

after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is quickly absorbed from the circulation and cells in the lymp@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely source of Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at age 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of patients had been developed from the middle phen@@ otype , and only a patient rejected the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had an associated exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the estimated value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where it received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the in@@ ability shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group , as seen from the following table .
the decrease in the percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute lung bu@@ ina increased further proportional to body @-@ size children .
of the 26 patients with a diagnosis of Hep@@ atic treatment 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the g@@ ag levels in the har@@ n ( µg / mg cre@@ at@@ inin ) was observed , which remained constant until the study period remained constant .
in terms of het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous disease ation between the patients receiving a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes corresponding to five efficacy variable ( range of shoulder @-@ range AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) was generally a improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients that were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with heavy trans@@ verse form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
for four patients , the dose of increased G@@ AG@@ - Spiegel in the Har@@ n was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks .
in multiple patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium run @-@ form indicate a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe distor@@ tion form only limited or even no progress in cog@@ nitive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ ological dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ si@@ zing schem@@ ata of the g@@ ag line in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .

in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , who had previously been treated with chemotherapy effects with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival rate was 8.3 months compared with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in 7.9 months .
however , in both studies , patients with which the cancer had not attacked the squ@@ am@@ ous epi@@ theli@@ al cells , at the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival compared to the same medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission announced that Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. made permission for the public transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each bottle of water has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dos@@ sh@@ ish is taken from the perme@@ ate bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic , non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ously as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
a reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given the day before and on the day of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ gift and the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of fol@@ ate and consumption must be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ omet@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need a intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ ric dose as well as after any third @-@ term business cycle .
in patients who received p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leuk@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , Dos@@ age examination needs to be held under the ages of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood @-@ image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predicted treatment cycles .
after recovery , the patients must be treated correspon@@ d@@ ingly in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the patient must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient needs the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA needs to be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose induc@@ ti@@ ents or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that patients at the age of 65 years , or higher compared to patients aged 65 years , an elevated by @-@ risk factor exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to in@@ sufficient data to un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical studies in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min there were no dose adap@@ tations which may be transmitted by recommended dose adap@@ tions for all patients .
data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function permit of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ by limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the lower limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in studies .
patients must be monitored in respect to the bone market . P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be given to patients before their total neut@@ rop@@ enia is again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ ten@@ se once again achieved a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ enia , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as it was observed in the previous treatment cycles . ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in degrees of 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ harmon@@ ized toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was considered as a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients need to be treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ yl@@ ate measure of reduction in toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) , the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti @-@ oxid@@ ation ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , lasting 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who have a therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ etry ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , where these events occurred , had associated risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ d@@ ration , existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid buil@@ du@@ p in the trans@@ cellular space should be considered a drainage of the eff@@ u@@ ction in front of the p@@ em@@ et@@ ric treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular events were also reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally if this ingredient was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ pl@@ omas ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of a ir@@ reversible cran@@ ial of reproductive ability exists , males should be pointed out before treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted on how to get advice on the sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti @-@ phosph@@ oric acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) to a dimin@@ ished p@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ separation with the result of a prolifer@@ ating effects of side effects .
therefore caution is necessary to treat patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ d@@ - ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding the interaction with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ l@@ astic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) when the decision was made to treat patients du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in fluctu@@ ations , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected to take heavy birth defects in an application in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except when necessarily , and after careful consideration of the farm for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of a ir@@ reversible cran@@ ial of reproductive ability exists , males should be pointed out before the treatment start , counsel@@ ing advice on the sper@@ mac@@ on@@ ser@@ vi@@ e- .

the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ig@@ ning Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pla@@ ec@@ tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
differences between both treatment arms have increased through an improvement of lung function in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in the course of time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ cent@@ ric , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy was treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and from 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .

in a third study , all@@ i was compared to placebo with a BMI of 25 to 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after a year , compared to 2.3 kg , compared to placebo .
the study involving all@@ i patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed in patients with relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are stain@@ ed stain@@ ed at after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bo@@ wel movement , chair crisis , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( wind ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be applied to patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ in ( to preventing the transplan@@ tation with transplan@@ ting patients ) or drugs such as War@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term malign@@ ant syndrome ( if not enough nutrients are absorbed from digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or lact@@ ating mothers .

all@@ i is indicated for weight loss of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI of 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fet@@ ching nutrition .
all@@ i must not be applied under the age of 18 , because there are not enough data for efficacy and safety .
however , or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ically absorbed , in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary .

the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of the occurr@@ ence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase when all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ ranging single meal or ob@@ ese diet .
since weight loss of diabetes can occur with a improved metabolic control , patients who consult a drug against diabetes in the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage is to be adjusted to anti@@ diabe@@ tic .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol should ask for their doctor or pharmac@@ ist , whether the dosage must be adjusted to this drug .
it is advised to meet additional fluctu@@ ant preventive measures in order to prevent severe diar@@ rhoea in the case of serious diar@@ rhoea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study of inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in has been observed a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma concentration .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant in combination with or@@ list@@ at could be influenced the Quick @-@ values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ins in the norm range .
however , the patient should be recommended , before bed@@ time a supplem@@ ental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin pre@@ ate to ensure a sufficient vitality ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the gift of one @-@ one dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of volunteers , which at the same time received or@@ list@@ at , observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plas@@ ma@@ on@@ cent@@ ration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature , and related to pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 m@@ g. over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency on the available data is not estimated ) .
the prevalence of known side effects , which were detected after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known since these events were voluntarily recorded by a population in@@ certain size .
10 . it is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to def@@ lem@@ ons in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple @-@ outlets from up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects , without significant clinical findings occurred .
in the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at @-@ overdose may either have any side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on human and animal studies , systemic effects on humans and animals can be assumed from a rapid recovery of System@@ ic effects associated with or@@ list@@ at from or@@ list@@ at .

clinical trials has been derived from clinical trials , which is 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food waste .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled trials with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 provides the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ atory , fet@@ ching nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ani@@ zation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the study ( Table 1 ) and as a share of the participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value : 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabolic or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metabolic or@@ list@@ ings could be detected in plasma only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0,@@ 02 µ@@ mol ) and without any indication of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , which was administered minimal systemic res@@ or@@ ated dose , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 according to the dis@@ closure of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine group ) , were identified by nearly 42 % of the overall plas@@ mac@@ ro@@ cent@@ ration .

however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is provided with the simultaneous interpre@@ ting of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron based on drugs that leng@@ th@@ ens the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is leng@@ th@@ ened or that tend towards such an extension .
aside from other chemotherapy treatment , alo@@ xi would neither be used in the following chemotherapy treatment nor treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after receiving chemotherapy .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron un@@ inhi@@ bited the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic substances ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ ine and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concent@@ rating Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a population based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ ine and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) , and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( C@@ elec@@ trop@@ hi@@ ine , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , val@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) have no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience at the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron shouldn &apos;t be used for pregnant women , unless it is necessary to treat patients as necessary .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 mc@@ g ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) which were at least potentially with Alo@@ xi in the context of head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and shelter ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar events of adverse events were shown as in other dos@@ ages ; there were no dose mode of action .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective treatment with alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dos@@ ing .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , ≤ 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ value 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously at day 1 without exam@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ous .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine 1000 mg / m2 were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron based on Day 1 .
results of the study with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy were summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of a clinical trial , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron owns the ability to block the ion@@ ic effect on the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved in progress and leng@@ th@@ ening the duration of the shareholder .
the aim of the study carried out on 221 healthy volunteers had been ass@@ essing the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ v. and bi@@ of@@ ov@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in the plasma cent@@ ration , a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma cent@@ ration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally generally in generally across the whole dose of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ@@ g / kg in vocal and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
following the intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses ( ± SD ) mean IOP between Day 1 and Day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in t@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plas@@ tic@@ on@@ ment mean to 42 ± 34 % .
in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the overall exposure of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was measured after one @-@ earlier intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg , the C@@ max was higher after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys , and another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies of metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in lower measurements , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 metabolism of the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ changeable agent made about 40 % of the recommended dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous camera inspection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the Clear@@ ance Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of clinical studies showed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion@@ ic channels only in very high concentrations which may extend to the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation , which can extend the s@@ lung duration .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about thirty times of therapeutic exposure when humans ) , which were given every day over two years , led to a prolifer@@ ation of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ es ( in thy@@ roid gland , pit@@ u@@ er@@ en@@ mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and da Alo@@ xi used for unique application , relevance of these results will be dimin@@ ished for human beings .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of hepatitis C approved the treatment of the medicine for the treatment of Alph@@ eon 6 million is recommended .
this means Alph@@ eon was supposed to be similar to a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ t@@ ely effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference Remedy &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon was to treat the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C ( a viral infection ) of hepatitis C ( a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation indicates the liver tissue damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the drug .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data that prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in Hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference physician to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adju@@ sting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business . what were the greatest concerns that have caused the CH@@ MP to disp@@ atch the approval of the account ?
further , concerns have been noted that the data on stability of the drug and the drug @-@ market drug may not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hepatitis C which spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon Ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease in more patients than at the reference det@@ erg@@ ent , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition , the test was initiated in the study to investigate the question of what the drug forms a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies , special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a cruci@@ fying formation of incoming skin infection ) and small in@@ ous in@@ fir@@ s ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ves ) , wor@@ sen@@ ing and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go shall not be used for treatment of infections who have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this type of infection may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the surface area should not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient claims no treatment after two or three days , the doctor should again examine the patient and consider alternative treatments in consideration .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was left to the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin @-@ dogs , about 90 % of the patients were enrolled in both groups .
in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was diagnosed in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( failed hol@@ low habitats in the body tissue ) or of infections which have been caused by MR@@ SA , which is not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation in the Con@@ tractor .
the Human@@ itarian Relief Sub@@ stances Committee ( CH@@ MP ) announced that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go caused by short @-@ term skin infections in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections from the following superf@@ icial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ s , depreciation or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . , a approval to the Council of Al@@ tar@@ go into the whole of the European Union .
patients in which there are no improvement within two to three days , should not even be examined and considered an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of an awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully caught and an adequate alternative treatment of the infection are started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be applied to the treatment of infections when MR@@ SA is known or presum@@ ed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary trials , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin , Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were in@@ sufficient .
alternative therapy is expected to be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected passage occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plas@@ mi@@ stress concentrations that were reached in humans after top@@ ical application , a clinical relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 Accord@@ ing to the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ be increased to the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure after therapeutic application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not necessary , if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive x@@ iz@@ ity according to oral ing@@ es@@ tion and are in@@ sufficient in terms of a statement regarding the birth and the red@@ dish / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an systemic antibiot@@ ic .
in deci@@ ding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be termin@@ ated , is between the benefits of stagn@@ ation for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical trials on 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go have applied , the most frequently reported adverse event on the event was about 1 % of the patients concerned .
mode of mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of re@@ activ@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis caused by interaction at a certain binding point of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes which diff@@ ers from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Center .
due to the binding of this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line block the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , partially P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if the local prevalence of resistance should appear in the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , a advice should be aimed at by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in the case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be was placed daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and sc@@ oring for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sample took place in days 3 or 4 with adult patients each before medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic absorption on humans in accordance with top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) is 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP @-@ in@@ hibition .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily convey@@ ed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under small participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro inspection on genetic mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats @-@ micro@@ kern@@ els for in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility with oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) .
in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic study in rats , at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to which ≥ 3 times of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development of development ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed ov@@ ary ) and maternal toxic@@ ity were detected .

ambient is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between a and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
ambient is applied in one of two doses of the vaccine , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may be reached first after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if during immun@@ isation a low risk of hepatitis B infection is made and ensured that the vaccine will be managed by two doses .
if a re@@ frac@@ tive dose of Hepatitis A or B is desired , ambient or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vaccines have no vaccines by assi@@ sting the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
after a child received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and the surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix also contains the same components as the 18@@ rix adult vaccine since 1996 and has been approved in Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of one out of three doses taken in the vaccine .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult identical ingredients contain some of the data used for the application of Twin@@ rix adult , also as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of protective concentrations .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a 6 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
ambient temperature led between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection on developing antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of ambient temperature was similar in a six @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , sor@@ eness of the injection plant , redness , plac@@ iness ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
August 2002 : the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ ica . a permit for public transport from Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the prim@@ ers with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , where the first dose is given at the appointment of choice and the second dose to be administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a remote control is requested both for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ u@@ ine vaccines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody @-@ antibody an@@ tigen observed after an initial appearance and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody values are in the same size as the vaccine with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines .
it is not completely assured whether immun@@ o@@ int@@ ent individuals who have addressed on a hepatitis A@@ - vaccine , they may not need to be protected as a protection , as they can also be protected from immune memory due to immun@@ ologic memory .
3 As with all injec@@ tions , in the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation system is recommended with the combination pul@@ p , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
at hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patient and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , the basic anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody is achieved , so in these cases , the gift of additional vaccines may be required .
since a intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the muscle can lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ etus , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
however , in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular offering .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ os@@ res@@ cent therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ defects , this may not be sufficient ir@@ responsible immune response .
in a clinical study that has been carried out with 3 vaccination doses of this formulation , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mud , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ vative in@@ oc@@ ul@@ ant vaccine .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations ranging from 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ iness on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the treatment of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.8 % of the subjects compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans combine vaccine .
according to the entire vaccine cycle , 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects who had received ambi@@ ance had been vacc@@ inated over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose and have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose .
however , the frequency of matches was comparable high ( that means over the whole vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects , the ambient temperature received , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % on subjects who received 3 @-@ doses offset pul@@ p ) .
the frequency of em@@ bos@@ sed pain and pain@@ t@@ ness was low and comparable , that was observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccination scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vaccines , the occurr@@ ence of local reaction reactions and general reactions were comparable to the ambient sub@@ merge with the 3 @-@ doses combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , for the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , vaccination with ambient pain was reported as a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , reported .
the proportion of vaccines which reported severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ doses vaccination schem@@ as with the combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B vaccine , was statistically significant not different .
in clinical trials , which were carried out in vaccines at the age of 1 up to including 15 years , the ser@@ ene rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV is 9@@ 9.1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 ab@@ dic@@ ated dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 ab@@ dic@@ ated dose ( that is in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined pul@@ p with three doses .
at 289 people whose immun@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ treatment significantly higher than with ambient .
the immun@@ ity , which were reached in a clinical compar@@ ative study with 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after the end of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccination scheme with ambient or a 3 @-@ doses vaccination scheme with a combined 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
for people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be demonstrated after at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix at 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vaccination scheme .
the immune response shown in this study was comparable to both anti@@ gens that were formed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination pul@@ p , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B @-@ B and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies were comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination scheme .
if the first dose ambient temperature of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps vaccine was given , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ us@@ p@@ ation by eye @-@ note to any other particles and / or physical visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in water @-@ contaminated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix can not be completely protected from an infection with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vaccines and Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) a vaccine may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver injury or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• Even if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine it including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can be characterized by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of your face or tongue . • if you / your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you would like to have protection against hepatitis B quickly ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the default administration of the second vaccination dose ) .
in a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambi@@ ance .
instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vaccination dose ( 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine is usually given a month after the first dose , and should give you a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccine .
sometimes , ambi@@ ance is inj@@ ected with people who suffer from severe bleeding problems under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child are under@@ gone a hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient can be given in these cases , but the immune response of those people on the vaccination cannot be sufficient , so that a blood test can be needed to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Send your doctor if you / your child may take additional medicine / taking ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without wear ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated without wear ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated with immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or if you have been planned in the near future .
however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient , and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated on separate positions and possible with different lim@@ bs .
if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be enough .
usually ambient or lact@@ ating women should not be administered unless it is ur@@ gently needed to vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .

ambient is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needle and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the basis of the data , which have been announced since issu@@ ance of the first approval for the decision , the CH@@ MP re@@ signed that the benefit ratio remains positive for ambi@@ ance .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only transported in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medic@@ inal product is limited to the small patient ex@@ position .
Ammon@@ es@@ eed can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with full enzyme defect or with hyper@@ b@@ aric en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain injury due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in history .
Ammon@@ es@@ eed is split - split up to several single boxes at meals - swallowed , mixed with food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y ( through the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a nose probe ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , because Ammon@@ es@@ eed could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo which means without an active substance ) .
ammon@@ aps can also suffer loss of loss , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , liquid body , chest pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( CH@@ MP ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end indicates that ammon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea @-@ cycle are effectively prevented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as a result of the condition of the condition at the time of approval , only limited information on this medicine was prescribed .
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete en@@ rich enzyme already in the new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 living days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ bearing form ( in@@ adequate enzymes that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life month ) , an indication of hyper@@ men@@ ial en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with si@@ p disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ ators .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the appropriate daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ solid lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ e@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ometer bam@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ ate deficiency must be arg@@ inine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with si@@ p disorders , as a risk for the formation of oil sp@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not reach immediately on the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used for patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and furn@@ ish infections only with caution .
since metabolism and separation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat takes place over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic to young rats , high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed mat@@ uring of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be detected if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic will be eliminated in the breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is con@@ tra @-@ indicated during the breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS represented at least 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ i@@ red event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ genetic patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lact@@ am , heavier hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of overdose occurred during a 5 @-@ month @-@ old small child with an exceptionally good dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic , which showed a dos@@ is@@ ite neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity by intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic is a metab@@ oli@@ zed - active link which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that will be eliminated via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative vehicles for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with body disorders can be assumed that each gram can be produced in sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis will begin early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the onset of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ antry , and the disease resulted in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alogy within the first year of life .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ) , protein reduced cal@@ orie and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase survival rate new@@ bor@@ ated at post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first life month ) .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was suffering from many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ solid form of the disease ( including female patients with the het@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ hic bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ b@@ ular en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein di@@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical system can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney @-@ enzyme with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in an empty healthy adult and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as recur@@ rent gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after the im@@ pregn@@ ation of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were found .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary frac@@ tional disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bi@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was prov@@ able to guarantee an phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic in plasma during the next morning .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which have been treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentration were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine above the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( infants and children who could not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with si@@ p disorders ) or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de as well .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins should be held within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ solid lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ e@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ometer bam@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to the maximum daily dose .
when rat bur@@ ses were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ( active met@@ aboli@@ t of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain of the brain .
an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ genetic patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lact@@ am , heavier hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative vehicles for the extradition of excess
on the basis of examinations over the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the urine test can be assumed that each gram can be produced in sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical system can occur .
according to an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ ators , 15 minutes after the use of measur@@ able plasma and phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the completed product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , the small measuring spoon contain 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring sco@@ op 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient must have been treated over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS cannot be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases are absent liver enzymes , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ cking protein products , which may not separate after the consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are done with laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you take other medicines or recently taken if it is not prescription drugs .
during the breast@@ feeding you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine might go over to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disorders , dis@@ appearances , dis@@ ori@@ enti@@ ousness , memory problems , and wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you identify one of these symptoms , turn immediately with your doctor or with the emergency department of your hospital at the introduction of an appropriate treatment in connection .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes of blood flow ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ cy@@ tes , headache , fain@@ ting , liquid pain , nausea , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , un@@ pleasant skin od@@ or , rash , ren@@ al dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or notice effects that are not listed in this manual information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revers@@ ing date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and can no longer be used on the exp@@ iry date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , and contents of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape and they are equipped with the em@@ bos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If you are done with laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you take other medicines or recently taken if it is not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS available on same individual outlets or over a gast@@ ric fi@@ stel ( hose , that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose probe ( hose , which is run through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon Gran@@ ules . • Put a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the edge of the knife to remove surplus gran@@ ulation . • Take the measuring spoon about a measuring sco@@ op . • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon Gran@@ ules from the tank .
angi@@ ox is applied to treat patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood access to the heart ) , for instance with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the breast basket with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( cardiac attack ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( a abnormal measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who underwent a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help people with Ang@@ ina or heart attack on maintaining blood flow to heart and increasing the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS where the effects of angi@@ ox in sole gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared to conventional combination treatment with h@@ ep@@ ar@@ ine ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI the patient is often a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a sh@@ utter ) , and additionally they received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year in total as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators as effective as Hep@@ ar@@ ine , except for heavy bleeding in which there was much more effective than Hep@@ ar@@ ine .
angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other her@@ ds@@ ud@@ ine , or any other components .
it must also not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with heavy blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) arrived at the end that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ ar@@ ine .
the European Commission approved the Commission of Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . in September 2004 , the European Commission of Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd submitted a approval to the establishment of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ ation inf@@ ar@@ ction ) at an emergency response or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous frequency of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in a further sequence , one additional Bol@@ us should be increased from 0.5 mg / kg and increases the in@@ fusion of the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI in clinical trials , the reduced In@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a frequency of 0,5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the en@@ coding .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us @-@ gift of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to below 225 seconds , a second unit of 0,3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be done .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence lower ACT values , the re@@ Con@@ stitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medic@@ inal products should be carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ dose should be administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg incre@@ ment dose is administered correctly .
in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney efficiency ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which should be subjected to a PCI ( if using bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is a second bolt dose to test again after the second bolt dose .
in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney damage , which led to the approval of II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the administration of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us without Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 If patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients is indicated in di@@ aly@@ sis ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox is administered 30 minutes after the completion of the intraven@@ ous h@@ ep@@ ar@@ ine or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of molecular Hep@@ ar@@ ca@@ ine .

patients are carefully applied during treatment in relation to symptoms and signs of blood stress , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even when in PCI @-@ patient under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , most bleeding in arter@@ ial points can occur in patients who under@@ go per@@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ onic intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment of principle may occur everywhere .
in patients who take War@@ far@@ in and be treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be moved to ensure that the value after placing the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine once again reached the level of treatment .
based on the knowledge about the drug mechanism from anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( Hep@@ ar@@ ine , War@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , this active ingredients may increase the risk of bleeding .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdominal wall , inj@@ ected to the upper arm or the upper arm with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce sufficient insulin delivery ( sugar ) in blood , or insulin does not process insulin .
insulin diff@@ ers diff@@ ers very mar@@ gin@@ ally of human insulin and the change means it seems faster and a shorter period of action has a short @-@ effective human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in use with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin delivery , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes where the body of insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra has been examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in substance gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving type 1 diabetes after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % compared to insulin inhibit@@ ors .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration of 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are probably hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of other components , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can effect on blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a approval for the public transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of pancre@@ as , th@@ igh or del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els or sub@@ cut@@ aneous in@@ fusion in the area of pancre@@ as .
due to the dimin@@ ished Glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin resistance , the insulin demand for patients with a limitation of the liver function can be reduced .
any change of actual strength , the brand ( her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the is@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of delivery can draw a change in the insulin requirements .
3 A in@@ adequate dose or abor@@ tion of treatment , particularly in patients with insulin requiring type diabetes , may result in hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin delivery should be under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the time of occurr@@ ence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin delivery and can therefore change to change the treatment schem@@ as .
the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , solv@@ ents , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , fi@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ase , pent@@ oxi@@ fy@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic , sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ loos@@ er , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ se counter@@ parts are weak@@ ened or absent .
animal experiments showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if insulin delivery is over into human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor will it be absorbed after oral application .
the following are listed from clinical studies of which adverse reactions of drugs are listed , group@@ ed after system organ@@ ically ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; not well @-@ known ( frequency on the basis of available ba@@ the data is not estimated ) .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y Will fails to change the injection site within the injection unit , in a sequence a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y may occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness can be given by a intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by an appropri@@ ated person or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a physician .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the most severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glucose absorption ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue in effect occurs faster and the real time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin pul@@ ses showed insulin @-@ relevant dos@@ ing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg a proportional @-@ proportional pul@@ cos@@ ity effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of glu@@ cos@@ ity effects , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieved full glucose monitoring effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data was clearly shown that insulin resistance can be achieved in 2 minutes before the meal is a comparable post @-@ den@@ ial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , such as the human insulin that is 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin is achieved in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ ial control was obtained than with human normal insulin that has been given 2 minutes before the meal .
insulin is an@@ cho@@ red 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in the normal insulin that is given 2 mi@@ xes before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery within 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the start of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin resistance in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - subsequent ) after the onset of the meal in comparison to human body @-@ insulin , which was 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1C ) .
